## About the project
Our project "What political impact does social media have?"  

The seven research questions we worked on are:
1. How has the public perception of anti-vaccine conspiracy via YouTube changed during the last five years? 
2. To what extent do spikes in Wikipedia pageviews related to the AfD align with increases in YouTube video uploads about the party during German federal elections?
3. In what ways has social media contributed to the growth and visibility of the Fridays for Future climate movement? 
4. How did public interest and sentiment in the #MeToo movement evolve over time?
5. How has the perception of Sahra Wagenknecht's presence on social media changed in the past before and after founding her own party?
6. To what extent does the number of social media posts (on YouTube) by political parties influence election results?
7. How has public opinions about the â€˜tradwifeâ€™ movement evolved since its beginning in 2020?

We used LLMs to gather keywords (KeyBERT), filter out stopwords (spaCy) and calculate sentiment (VADER). 
Additionally, we used LLMs to help rewrite and translate text for our website/poster from German to English.
