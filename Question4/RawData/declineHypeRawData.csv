Parlons encore Me Too Stand Up
Pourquoi je soutiens Me Too Stand Up
"Many men are fed up with all the ""rules"" and are simply opting not to talk to women at all."
"Ironically, the MeToo movement has become the very harassment that it claims to fight."
Men are not ‚Äúscared‚Äù or ‚Äúintimidated‚Äù.   We have observed the minefield and chose a path to avoid it entirely.  We are walking away‚Ä¶.
"MeToo didn't destroy men.
It woke us up"
"Dont say anything at all, just ignore women, full stop."
"Stop complimenting women, easy."
Every guy I know young or old is absolutely done with women! WAY too much hassle. NOT WORTH IT!!!!!
"Women actually destroyed the workplace the moment they joined it. 

Everything is like walking on eggshells, just waiting for this highly emotional being to find any reason to tick off."
"So called ""strong women"" are threatened by compliments."
Chivalry is dead‚Ä¶.you women killed it.
The women complaining about men giving compliments are the ones who are jealous because they don‚Äôt get any.
The feminist movement destroyed men long before the Me Too movement came along.
We‚Äôre also sick of being treated as expendable.
The reason why hr exists is because of women. No hr on the building sites i work on
"The world is falling apart because men like me just went ‚Äúalright‚Äù and let the women take charge. Are things better? Do you feel safer? Are you happy, now?"
"""Me too"" was a wake up call for men."
"I refuse to even make eye contact with them on the street at this point. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
"Thank you for the compliment. I'm one of the good guys who left the dating scene years ago. When I was still working it got to the point I never talked to women. I went MGTOW to protect myself, my peace and to stay safe."
"The last time I gave a female co worker a compliment I got called up to HR and they said I apparently made an ""inappropriate remark"". They warned me not to do it again and now I avoid her like the plague. All I said to her was that she looked nice that day because I could tell she put effort into her hair and makeup before work, wasn't even flirting for real as I knew she had a longterm boyfriend.
Never doing that again. Just don't do it fellas."
"The same women will make reels and tick tocks asking, 
"" Why don't men approach me in public? "" 
"" Where are all the good men?"" 
"" Why don't men include me in social circles at work?"" 
"" Dating culture is dead in Australia."""
"It's incredibly patronising to be told what you can and can not say as adults and professionals. Treating men like children is commonplace now. Seriously, how did we get here."
"Just like modern feminism. It's not about fundamental rights anymore, but about how much you can get by complaining and playing the victim."
"Men just switched off, and women are noticing it. Most guys will only go out of their way to interact and help out a small number of women who are related to them. Helping out female strangers? Not worth the risk."
Ignore women‚Ä¶ period.
"It‚Äôs not the me too movement. It‚Äôs that modern women are entitled, have internalized a lot of negative beliefs about men, and don‚Äôt feel like they need to offer anything to the relationship. No thanks"
"I avoid all vvomen as much as humanly possible. I'm happy with that, and I am sure they are too. The peace is extraordinary."
"if i spent that much money on a ticket just to be told my speech is to be policed, i'd demand a refund of 200% for every man there, and then have us all leave."
I wouldn‚Äôt say destroyed- I would say it made us all see the light.
It destroyed relationship dynamics and also promoted false victims meanwhile the actual victims are drowned out.  Men adapted as we always do.
"""Fuckable"" was not on the list though, so maybe they could say it."
So MEN's speech is being policed. Shocker.
"The biggest problem is that the men who actually have good intentions and respect women listened and did what they said, they stopped approaching or even talking to you at all. The creeps who want to take advantage of women already didn't care if what they were doing was wrong, and so they continued on as usual. So all you achieved was removing any good men from the equation. Funny how the bullies never had trouble getting dates, the abusers, the criminals, never known any of them to struggle with women. Good men who respect and care about women? They mostly die alone after a life of being invisible. Why are we shocked when the younger generations are following Tate etc when all they ever see are good men suffering and bad men winning?"
I live by one rule. Never compliment a woman ever!
The same comment from a Chad will elicit a totally different reaction than from an unattractive man----possibly a call to HR.
"There‚Äôs an old saying: least said, soonest mended.  When in doubt, hold your tongue.  Silence may be misunderstood, but it can never be misquoted."
Construction workers need a massive pay rise. That'd save a lot of men
Men are fed up with the overreach and the planned destruction of men by the people behind this movement.
"""You're so beautiful"" does come across as cringe, especially in 2025. Gentlemen, don't do it. Treat them like men."
It has freed a lot of men from devorce rape and false allegations ‚ù§
HR isn‚Äôt a necessary part of a company
It hasn't destroyed men. It has shown them who women really are.
I just married a woman from a non Western culture. I don't need to ask her what she brings to the table. I don't need to ask what I get back for all the energy I put in. It's obvious.
"I have not complimented a woman in years. Frankly, I don't care anymore."
"In a work environment, always compliment with ""You look almost competent"" instead of ""You look sexy."""
I'd ask for a refund right there. Give me my $500 dollars back and I'll spend my time doing something else.
"ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Gentlemen, simply walk away. I can assure you, your silence will be greater than any ‚Äúoffensive compliment‚Äù a woman has ever received."
"It didn‚Äôt destroy men. It just changed them to consider life without women, and for the most part it‚Äôs a positive experience."
"One of the reasons I gave up romance and I know I am not the only one to do so. Women want to be left alone, they got their wish."
Don't blame metoo. Blame the women who joined it or promoted it AND the women who were sucked into believing it.
And women wonder why men stopped even approaching them at all.
"Anything bad that has happened to women at miscellaneous moments in history will pale in comparison to the catastrophic mistake of MeToo.

Women didn‚Äôt just screw men over during that movement, women screwed themselves, each other, their daughters, younger sisters; anyone that now has to navigate the world today post MeToo. 

Most men and women are alone now because for men, it‚Äôs not worth risking their lives and reputations on speaking to, approaching or associating with the wrong woman.

It‚Äôs over and there no going back now."
"""destroyed"" = set them free üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"They basicly ban the legit compliments ...
Did they hand notes to women ?

God, lately I do regret being part of this mankind ..."
Enjoy your career in 'cybersecurity.' The jeets will have your jobs in short order.
"The ""MeToo"" movement has left women single for life.
Men are not destroyed, they are doing their own thing without women.
Bye, bye ladies."
"As a man cruising into middle age i have mates who are single / divorced. They now refuse to date because its too dangerous. They live in fear of slander and false accusation. One has admitted to me he plans to be celibate and die alone, numerous dates with all kinds of women they no longer ask about work, taste in music etc but from 1st minute of sitting down cross examine him on polical views. He told me when he realised he was trying to get a table with plenty of cctv on him he just went stuff it, ill stay hm."
"Giving power to those who have no loyalty, wisdom, conscience, or morals invites chaos. 

These women will be in a bad mood and will destroy a man based on accusation alone. 

And look at the results- more enmity."
"The ""metoo"" movement hasn't made any impression on me, I can assure you DanicaüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"""MeToo"" didn't destroy men at all.  To most men it restored (or should have restored) knowledge they should have known from childhood regarding the realities of women's nature and behavior.  It demonstrated very loudly what women naturally are.  It reminded us of what societies throughout human history inherently knew but our society somehow forgot.   If anything, ""MeToo"" returned men's regard of women back in line with nature and objective reality.  Men's behavior toward women now is the natural response to these women's natural behaviors.  This is why societies worldwide throughout history managed women they way they did.  If they didn't, this happened and the society collapsed.   Organize your regard for women and your behavior with women by what women naturally do and how they regard you and treat you when free to do so, observe what is happening now -- let that be your teacher and guide.  This is what women really are.  Plan and respond accordingly."
"2017 August lost job because a female and outsourced workers claimed I exposed myself, multiple cameras displayed the true testament, yet I was the one in the wrong...""me too"" can lay in the bed it's created, made an indefinite enemy."
"Most women think this is fixable,
They are wrong, 
They are starting to see that men are not scared,
WE ARE DONE, 
AND DONE MEANS PERMANENTLY DONE."
I like how they only handed these to men. As if women can't possibly be creepy and innapropriate at a workplace.
"I read through a couple of hundred comments here, not a single one from a woman. That's very telling."
"You can just take out the space between ‚ÄòIn‚Äô and ‚ÄòSecurity‚Äô, and it works perfectly."
I worked in and office and women would ask me from time to time what I thought of their outfits. I refused to answer.
Do not bother with them full stop
"$500 per ticket - nice.
Women need their own award ceremony - great.
Being told how to speak - fabulous."
It used to be comical that people would have such audacity to be policing others in such a childish way. It really is just an embarrassing grab for authority in position when there really is nothing to be had
"No, no, it set men free, best thing that ever happened"
"Glad that
1) I wouldn't go to an event like this
2) I never compliment women I don't know"
Can you imagine if you reversed the genders and a man handing out a pamphlet to all the women explaining how to be appropriate.
The women insecurity award. That would be a tough battle.
"If it flies, floats or phucks, it's cheaper to rent."
"""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"". Clip from old move, still relevant to-day!"
"Just say they look dreadful, and if they had a issue, tell them they did not want us to say nice things, so we went just as negative as they are"
The juice is no longer worth the squeeze.
Glad I‚Äôm old and not having to date. If I were a young man and woman approached me at the bar I would immediately think I was being set up.
"The only thing I am scared of when it comes to these women is my emotions and my reactions, beyond that, these women ain't scaring nobody."
I don‚Äôt even call it the me too movement because I call it the lie too movement because most cases around the world have been proven to be lies.
"I no longer mentor women. They don‚Äôt need help. The men need help in the workplace, most of the women are DEI hires"
"The women's movement won the battle, but lost the war."
"I just don't speak to them at all anymore.  Only if necessary, and very brief about it.  They bring nothing but trouble and drama."
Gender policing is descrimination. Do not participate in such misandry.
Him downplaying it doesn't really help to raise awareness
"I can agree that in a professional setting, both men and women should behave themselves. I concur that the MeToo movement was a turning point in male-female relations. It convinced me that the best policy was to pull back from any friendly behavior toward women in any setting lest it be misinterpreted. I still can't shake that feeling. If anything, women's behavior in 2025 has convinced me I made the right choice."
Bypass the self crippling deal of modern marriage and just adopt if you want to start a family.
"No no no.
Its destroyed women and freed men"
Removing compliments in this situation actually hurts females more than men.
"Winning- Not Helping Women- Working with & Doing Business with Ourselves, Awareness of Liabilities- Traveling- $‚Äôs & Women- Non Western Countries!‚úÖüíØ"
"If it were my list, I‚Äôd have Nothing on it because Modern women deserve Nothing. üëé"
"Women only want compliments from Chads.  Every other man need not offer their compliments, thank you very much."
"3:22 She claims that most people know intuitively what is appropriate and what isn‚Äôt.

The problem isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmost people‚Äù it‚Äôs the fringe, radical outliers that use the system to batter men. These crazies use law as a weapon to ‚Äúsmash the patriarchy‚Äù or ‚Äúscore points for the Sisterhood‚Äù ‚Ä¶ at the expense of reasonable men."
Actually the metoo movement destroyed women. Men walked away and women lost their minds
"Just sue in court the woman who did this note only to m'en fir discrimination and sexisme, lol !"
"I for one, am not ""destroyed"". My single male friends rejoice at being woman free.üá¶üá∫"
And very soon technology will destroy and replace women
"How about just ignore them altogether, better yet avoid having them around spaces where you feel comfortable with your other colleagues lol"
"Blokes should have turned around and said ""this is discrimination and harrassment""."
"Pesident Ulysses S Grant once had a quote along the lines of: ""If we treat every man as if they're guilty... we will not be able to find good men when we need them."""
it really freed men from the endentured servitude to women. We can now work hard for ourselves and our wellbeing. To hell with what society says
This is why women dont come forward. These girls risked everything to tell their most embarassing stories. And this guy is walking free... i hope they are protected
"I saw a video of him lifting Cassie and slamming her, it broke my heart. This monster should be rotting in prison üíî"
As a survivor who was failed by the justice system this is so heartbreaking and devastating‚Ä¶ I really thought it would be different this time but I‚Äôm not surprised. Heart just aches for the victims
He‚Äôs rich.
Actually the real reason he isn‚Äôt being charged with the serious offences is because it happened in America. You guys elected trump again and he broke the law how many times? Celebrities and rich people are not treated like we are treated in the USA
He‚Äôs rich and has people willing to do anything he asks.
We need more Mario's brother
We live in a victim blaming society.
"No, he walked because too many rich and famous people were involved ."
"Sadly, this isn't surprising"
"Honestly, I‚Äôm not surprised that Diddy got away with a slap on the wrist"
The real reason he wasn't found guilty is because there was no proof. End of story
The fact that people are complaining the procescution didn't cater to the jury is disgusting. We truly are a country where facts don't seem to matter anymore. It could happen right in front of their face and they would need to be convinced it happened.
"Yeah honestly. The rule of law does not protect the innocent. Its main priority, especially in america, seems to be ensuring criminals are not convicted of too many crimes. Cause the prosecution was the government so they have access to as much evidence as they can sanction. All the defence has to do is figure out a way to weasel out of it. I think criminal lawyers get the easy ride too. They earn more and often use the tactic of badgering already vulnerable witnesses to weaken their testimony or relying on jury members being held in contempt. Just my perspective but i have VERY LITTLE faith in the rule of law as a woman. 
I see it fail us all the time, especially in SA cases, which is why we often refuse to report or press charges. Why bother when the odds are stacked against you even more"
If the stories are true he's committed much more heinous crimes then that he's being charged on. Just that his victims are too ashamed or afraid to come forward.
Its not because he‚Äôs rich it‚Äôs because the thing jurors needed to believe was women in low standing and they would rather believe the man they‚Äôve seen physical beat and abuse these people than the actual victims.
Follow the money of the jury it will tell it all
He 100% is going to be part of DT's administration
Rich and depraved are always protected
He is a waste of space and had a seriously gullible jury!üôÑ
"Disappointing, but not surprising."
"The justice system worked as intended. To protect the interests and the persons with power. It is not, and never has been, about righteousness."
"It wasnt the justice system that failed, it was the jury lol"
Nope. The witnesses painted themselves as willing participants in the freak offs. Ruined the entire case the more they spoke. He will still do 5-10.
"Money talks, üí©üí© walks"
It was misogyny. They simply didn‚Äôt believe the women.
"Please let this dude rot in prison, he's been doing messed up stuff since the 90s."
Witness testimony is the worst form of evidence allowed in the legal system. It sounds like that's why he was not found guilty on those counts. You need something more solid than just a bunch of accusations to convict someone of a crime.
Trump wanted a taste of Diddy party
"Honestly, this verdict made me so upset and so disgusted at the geriatric jury! Stop having people from 1960. Make decisions for women in 2025. It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting. Sean is a human trafficking predator who beat and tortured women abused his employees literally committed Rico like activity and walked away because he‚Äôs famous tired. I hope the judge gives him the maximum I don‚Äôt care. I am furious with this."
"This is my third attempt to leave a comment on your video, but YouTube keeps deleting it.  The first comment was an intelligent response.  The second comment was me complaining about YT purposely deleting anti-Diddy comments and they even deleted that out!!!!  Let‚Äôs see if this third comment sticks.  Oh yeah!  There‚Äôs no intelligent comment in this third posting and the anti-Diddy stuff so yeah it‚Äôll stick."
"Weistein, Cosby and now Diddy.  Its absolutely disgusting how rich men just get a slap on the wrist"
Of COURSE Trump would pardon him! Women have to unite NOW!!!
This whole thing is like a Boondocks episode
Victim blaming.NOT COOL!
Because they were seeking life. I'm an up-to-20-year-total qualified juror.
Start dishing our your own justice ladies. Just know how to do it
Tell me something new üò¢
And they'll tell women not to use the second amendment
My point stands that Trump only ever pardons the worst people on Earth.
outrageous.  They disregarded the victims.  Anyone found the children yet?  Disgusting!!!
The fact they keep saying he is going home with a possible 20 yrs sentence . Sounds like simething is shady. Make it make sense
"There was no evidence, I don't know why he even went to jail. I'm not saying he's not a bad person but the evidence wasn't there. I'm done with this channel this lady is too extreme"
Money
"Close enough, welcome back R-Kelly trial"
"Alternatively, we dont know the whole story as we weren't presented any of the evidence nor did we hear any rebuttals against that evidence, all we knew were the charges. Reminder a prosecutor doesn't need beyond a reasonable doubt evidence to CHARGE someone with a crime, they only need Probable Cause"
"You push things too far in one direction, and the pendulum will swing back."
Why anyone has faith in The justice system is beyond me
"All that baby oil was actually just to make sure no one could make the charges stick, apparently"
"Lawyers are very skilled at discrediting women, they have methods to paint them as liars and twist their words into seeming like something it‚Äôs not. This is why women seldom speak up."
Yasssss. What about those kids and looking into child Protective Services. Where are these kids  coming from.
"Nope, all wrong. You have no idea of what's really going on here. I promise it has nothing to do with the metoo movement. This is WAY more complex than anything like that."
Those jurors should be ashamed.
I have a friend who is angry about the Diddy verdict but is a full on Trump loving cultist. How do women like her not realize that all of this is tied together?
20 years in means he‚Äôs gonna die üíÄ in prison.
"I didn't follow, but I've seen people saying he didn't even have a defense, no witnesses, nothing..."
Oh well. Seems to me when someone is put in prison we say the system finally worked and when someone is found not guilty we say the system is broken.
I'm not surprised
Such bull$hit
Lame take
"He‚Äôs being not guilty has nothing to do with being black! It‚Äôs because of being evil! Christ honors women and demonstrates it by choosing a woman for the 2 most honored responsibilities ever given: birth of Christ; and proclaiming, ‚ÄúHe is Risen!‚Äù She became the first Evangelist!"
Because he has too much money and has too much dirt on other wealthy people. That‚Äôs why!
Stay inside
Trump only pardoned him because he wants an invite to the next party.
What about the jailhouse phone call Diddy made telling his sons to destroy the evidence in his house before the cops find it
They didn't have more women on the jury because they couldn't find that many that couldn't say they havent been sexually assualted
A rico charge is for an organization not 1 person! That was stupid from the beginning.
8 men and 4 women.... Wow. Okay. Probably could have gone with an equal amount of men and women.... That's why they didn't find him guilty.
BTW Lil Tay Just Started Her OF
Now he coming for the victims.
"#1 is he is rich. #2 idk her name, but the one lady stayed with or came back to him after being raped and abused."
Amber Heard destroyed the MeToo movement
"""witch hunt"" üòÇ this country sucks."
I'm sorry but women have a looong way to go to as far as same sentence for same crime n don't get me started on divorce and custody
Trump got him off
Classic. Smh üò™
Also because money
Why doesnt nowthis post anything about israel?
"I know no details of this case, but it sure sounds like a good place to end jury trials.
Where I come from, we just don‚Äôt have them. We may need more judges, but it feels more suitable when times are changing but some people don‚Äôt want to go along with it."
You don‚Äôt get to have your cake and eat it too. Judy found they were willing participants so yea.
"It's violates human rights to want anyone ever to be convictable of anything, ever, only on believing a victim's word. Word against word is never ever evidence, hence never ever due process."
üíôü§Æüíôü§Æüíôü§Æüíô
ü§¨
Oof.
ü´¥‚öñÔ∏è
üòÇüòÇüòÇ wtf is wrong with all. The counts were unanimous so what about the 4 women on the jury? Yup its all men's fault üòÇüòÇ
For the people who don‚Äôt know when diddy was found guilty of ‚Äúthe transportation to engage‚Äù he was going to the house of women who worked at nowthis news cause that‚Äôs what they are
I have mixed feelings on the metoo movement especially in regards to the johnny depp and amber heard trial
"This is the thing with current dems. Most men who vote don't care about this. Woman are vindictive. The voting age men dont like the lgbthdtv movement, or the me too movement. This loses you supporters. i hate current republicans but i dont like the current dems. Most men have to chose the lesser of two bad choices. Shame on you guys forcing your opinions on the whole of dems."
That's a stretch to see that the democrat led search is motivated by metoo
Lol shut up he rapped men to what are you talking about? Stop blaming men
"If that was on the drawer as a woman, I would‚Äôve found him not guilty of every single charge"
It‚Äôs because the jurors voted not guilty on the serious charges.  A fair jury was chosen.  Maybe the government didn‚Äôt prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
Will trump pardon diddy?
Its all men.
"I'm not a Diddy fan, but those women exchanged a lot of texts finding out when the next Freak Offs would be and who to bring."
Not a backlash..Women just want to legalize jailing men on allegations alone ‚Ä¶Your experience and account has to stand up to scrutiny ..
NOBODY CARES
Haha with all the privileges woman have today who cares tbh don‚Äôt effect me
it did not fail women! Those women in the trial were 100% willing participants! Period!
The best move started from Kerala ! We need such report in all industry üéâ
"Kerala is the first to appoint a committee to learn about the industry problem..
Other industries also should have this type of courage"
Mollywood does create impactful cinema and is the first in the film industry to establish a committee to ensure safety and equality for women. Kudos to Mollywood for spearheading this important reform.
Kudos to the actresses of Malayalam film industry for stepping up and fighting courageously while other industries use women for pleasure and benefits....üéâ
"I am happy this has started atleast with Malayalam cinemas, Respect to those who came forward and acknowledged this.Now it's time for others too, I am sure this happens in bollywood and others too. It's high time now for everyone to stand up and speak. Let more of Hema committee be formed. Let this be a lesson for other too."
He should resign . But enquiry must be conducted and if  any action against law must be proceeded with.

"You lost your case when you said Today Super star .. He is an actor.. How come any actors become super stars wen they are ready to entertain, dance, drama for 3 hours for 100 rupees ? Society is screwing them.. They are actors, period.. Superstars are our parents who work day and night for us, our teachers , our friends who help us etc.."
Same or worst exist in Bollywood.... Why only talk about mollywood
Do u understand this is the first time an industry going forward and correcting .
"Salute to you all for exposing the corruption and exploitation. From pakistan. You all are on the right path.

Good job... these pervert film production related criminals should be ashamed.
"Why did he resign now. FEAR of being prosecuted or defamed ??? How convenient. He must have know all the happenings including the kidnapping & rape & torture of the actress, for SURE.

Exactly‚Ä¶ but it's not only in the Malayalam industry but I feel it's in Bollywood too. And they don't even know that they are abusing the weakest. And they are proud of doing it.
Should just be a precedent to many others that must be investigated throughout India.. toughest punishment should be handed over to such power group operators.
I am suprsed  to come to know the happening in the kerala film industries
Mohanlal seems to successfully accomplished 1000 women in totoüò¢

I hope we get them to also get a expose of them ..."
"There is something which nobody noticed, there is hidden lobby against leadership of AMMA , they Jailed Dileep for crime done by Pulser Suni, 
Director Kamal (original name is Kamaal ) and director Renjith did the same crime but only Renjith had to resign from same post, 
There is a Jihadi & Missionaries lobby behind this drama, no Muslim actor name is coming out except Siddique who was supporting Dileep,"
Kerala always leading cultural revolutions.. disrupting systems.. proud of you Girls and Boys ‚ù§

Exploiting the powerless until a days everything is exposed.
It's shameful."
HIGHEST LITERACY RATE FOR CRIMINOLOGY.
He should be investigated and prosecuted if evidence exists against him. The crimes occurred under his leadership.
Why isn't the perspective not diplomatic and holistic. Mollywood speak up against violence and hold them accountable. Has even Hollywood done this?
"Mam, Entire flim industry in India works in same fashion among them one state alone got exposed !!!. Hope its one among the known secret's in india..."
"Respect to mohanlal!! Nowaday  position holding people don't even resign even after such cases and reports....

"Every where this type of thing's happen, In  it is very less compare to other other flim industries in India. Mean while what about media industries...??"
What about Honey Rose?
It was high time Malayalam industry needed this clean up!
This is there in every place.There are such groups everywhere. There are such people in every industry. Like Tovino said let it be remembered that the change started with Malayalam cinema(as always).

"Shame on the  mallus  who are very  proud  of their  superstar mohanalal, this is what  expected  from a literate  state  .. wow"
"Irony :most literate state is reeling under casting couches (favours by men for work opportunities for women ) 
This is evident not only education is important,.
QUALITY EDUCATION IS NEED OF HOUR(SDG 4)"
Now mohanlal  must reveal the villains
This is why a particular community has progressed in Kerala and other honest citizens were left out. Everywhere we go we see the result of such dirty deeds being done
Good job Mohanlal.
Same is in Bollywood They block outsider as  far  as possible . U meet Sushant like fate if are ambitious
Glad things are changing!
Yet they are the ones breaking the ice ‚ùÑ
"This news is misleading. He is not involved in any of the accusations. He resigned because many other actors were accused, and as the president of the association, he chose to step down"
Do u think Mohanlal was not aware...??? Not possible

"Malayalam industry is progressive to have an hema commission, why don't other industries do the same."
"This exists in every industry , just that people are shit scared to talk"
"The matter shouldn't end there, resigning doesn't yield the desired results. The responsible culprits  should be arrested and prosecuted and finally be banned from the industry.  We can see, as in other cases,  the probe and the investigations, be it by anyone else, take their own time thus delay the justice  to the victims."

"The HEMA committee you mentioned has nothing concrete other than a power group.

Why did you leave wion palki? Was that a mollywood power group initiation

 Today's generation are ready to do anything to get inside cinema. Then where is this humma commission üòä never stoop low to report such crap"
Should be punished....
Malayalam cinema bringing this into light will change how sexual harassment laws are enforced in India at every sector. At least Malayalam cinema brought the movement. All the other cinema industry is doing worse but hiding under the rug.

"Exploitation is everywhere. It's in cinema industry, in media industry, in textile industry, in construction industry everywhere. I worked for a construction company in Adoor (Kerala) called Builtech Builders and I didnt get any salary and then I resigned.  There are a lot of people, men and women who left this company similar way. They would conduct interviews once in every 3-5 months offering big salaries and absorb people and then after 2-3 months these people would be laid off and they would get no salary or a meagre amount. During their tenure there these people would be mentally  tortured and would be rendered as good for nothing fellows. And you won't dare to complain as you would be intimidated by the photos that are being posted in the various company whatsapp groups by the MD showing himself standing with many top politicians and ministers of Kerala State.

"Absolutely agree with him.
If a woman makes false accusations, She should immediately be sentenced the same amount of jail time the man would get if convicted"
Took him years and tens of millions.
And thats the real problem. The fact that women rarely(if ever) are punished for false accusations against a man.
It's funny how heard claim Johnny beat her but the next day there was no bruising or swelling. Other ladies that were beat up had body and face swelling and bruises everywhere. No makeup can really cover it up. Heard had flawless makeup

I agree 1000%!  Yes protect women if there found guilty. But if caught lying or slandering? Whatever time that man would have got. The false accuser should do.
If it can be proved in the same court that the accuser lied they should get similar punishment that the original defendant would have been facing

State of Idaho. CDA. Judge Peterson. Convicted me, I spent my 30 days after fusion, in a cell. Neck fusion. Needed help to even wash my body, wasn't able to shower for a month.

So Johnny Depp is the Spokesperson for what Black men have gone through for decades.
"To add on, the public, even the women, believed Depp because he's a movie star. If it's another average guy, none of those broads will care, and will still think he's the abuser. Women decides if you're right or wrong based on things like your money, status and how they FEEL about you. They don't ever make rational decisions"
"False accusations can destroy marriages, careers and lives. Not only that but also i believe it's very disrespectful towards real victims who previously or currently have to deal with real domestic abuse. It diminish the struggle."

The courts should just have you in a neutral ground until they find out what was true and or false before stamping the person as guilty or innocent.

"Thanks ladies, you told men to not ever believe you or take any of you serious. Us men risk jail for even taking any of you seriously. And i never heard of one woman that ever called this out.

we can't punish people for falsely accusing women of being witches cause then they won't come forward for the real witches

We went from not listening to women....to believing everything...human nature over compensaing
"Yup, the W always get a free ticket!!! Geez!"
And there are still females who believe Johnny is guilty of Amber's  allegations.
"Here is the issue. Most of the time when there is an imbalance there is an over correction. It is true that prior to the metoo movement too often women were dismissed too often. However, believe all women is a good idea that was misused. 

To make it work it should've been believe all women COULD be telling the truth so all accusations should be investigated BUT it should always be anonymously investigated. So the accuser and accused should get the same anonymity. Only when there is a verdict of guilty can the anonymity be broken. Anyone who opposes this literally opposes innocent till proven guilty."

Its innocent until proven guilty. Not guilty the moment a woman says something against you.

They shouldnt allow charges to even be laid without evidence. This is ridiculous."

Women never ‚Äúout ran‚Äù men. They were put in an elevator while men were denied access and told to take the slippery stairs the women oiled up.
"‚ÄúWomen kept running and men got left behind‚Äù is a completely erroneous way of putting it. Women have been propped up by government and DEI initiatives of some form or another. It‚Äôs not that women have outrun men. It‚Äôs that men have been systemically hindered while women have been boosted.

I watched my father and the fathers of every kid I knew in school have their lives destroyed by their wives.
Lesson learned."
"Unfortunately therapy got us to this point. The therapeutic profession is broken. I got my masters in clinical mental health, and I would not trust one of the people in my program to actually help someone. I may agree that competent therapy could help but the training profession in therapy is broken."
"""Choose emotionally healthy girls.""

Ah, great advice. So you are saying be on the hunt for the unicorn."
"I am the father of two boys. Happily, well adjusted, fearless, and successful. Because of sports, i was able to interact with many parents. One woman, Asian, made a very insightful and interesting comment. She said, ""This country hasn't figured out how to raise their boys.""  The comment was made in 2010. Our sons were in the 10th grade."
"Have women replaced men in the family, or has government replaced men in the family?"
"This culture has broken the boys of this country, and I fear, it is on purpose."
I was raised to believe that physical sexual desire for women was misogyny and i denied my own desires to the point of messing up my sexuality.  This is an epidemic right now. Glad to see these conversations are happening
"I loved her advice about dating ""Date emotionally healthy women.""  How do you find out if the woman is emotionally healthy ""Go out to dinner."" Ummnn...  That's definitely a chicken and egg thing.  Don't know if she's emotionally stable until you date her and yet you need to know if she's emotionally stable before you approach her and she screams her head off that you're going to do something bad to her."
"No.  No quotas, and don't rebalance classrooms.  It's up to men to build an education system for boys that gives them the academic hard skills.  But it also must let them get out, take risks and exhaust themselves.  Women may never be interested in us again.  But we can still choose to be excellent.  And working together in male hierarchies to overcome challenges is one of our real strengths that we'd better leverage."
"Sadly, there are many women and progressive men in K-12 education who marginalize young men. It‚Äôs arguably worse in higher ed. I‚Äôm glad to see this conversation happening."
The entire school systems goal is to elevate girls at the expense of the boys. This has been going on since i was in grade school in the late 80s early 90s n
"There‚Äôs also 1 billion subsidies that support women at the cost of men. 

I did a Fullstack Developer bootcamp, and they offered scholarships that would pay half or all of the bootcamp if you were a woman, and also girl-only lunches.

Not necessarily against these, but male mentorship is super important."
"I gotta say as a man of 54, i can identify with all of this stuff much earlier than some people. I had a mother who was a ground floor feminist, and she built a view of women in our house that they were supposed to be on a pedestal, and that they don't do wrong. It actually made my brother and I are a little afraid of women or maybe insecure is a better way to put it. Fast forward to nineteen eighty three I watched that same mother cheat on my father and destroy her entire family for another man and leave the family. Can you imagine what that did to a kid's mind When he learned the true nature of women? It took me years to unravel that and sometimes I still have trouble with it and I'd be lying if I said it didn't affect my relations with women. In my life i've managed to bed 15 different women. But I have to say there is a little bit of a love hate relationship with them inside me and it all goes back to my mother and the subject that you're talking about here"
"When John Papola talked about his son saying ""you don't know what it's like..."", his son was describing how he will be called out, judged and possibly ""shamed"" for ""making a move"" and most importantly, the mocking, shaming and judging  that will come form both men and women  if/when he gets rejected from making a move in the first place.
This is something that seriously needs to be discussed."
"As a single dad (widower) raising 6 boys under the age of 9, and also having raised 6 who are now young adults, this was a topic I looked forward to listening to. Being a boy dad is all I've known for my entire adult life. Before having kids I worked with early school-age kids in the public school system, mainly assigned to work with unhappy kids struggling to adjust to the school routine. All the kids I was assigned to work with were boys and all of them felt like they didn't belong in the public school community. In hindsight I can see that I wasn't assigned to those kids because the teachers and admin staff believed I was specially talented at helping them. They simply didn't like the boys or want to waste their own time on them so they used me to keep the boys out of their hair. I could see early on that public school is built like a family, but a thoroughly dysfunctional one that favours some of the kids and pathologizes/scapegoats the rest - the boys. 

When my boys reached school age I tried the public system for a few years and assumed that because of my experience in the system working with troubled kids I couldn't possibly run into any problems with my own kids at school. However, I soon saw my boys as miserable as the troubled kids I'd worked with years earlier. I pulled the boys and started homeschooling. Such an easy solution. They have no exposure to any media, entertainment, schooling or devices that constantly convey the message that boys are defective faulty beings who can only become ""good"" by being more girl-like. They are simply free to grow up as boys without any interference attempting to distort their nature. It's how all boys were permitted to grow up before the woke assault on boys.

I enjoyed the early segments and was in strong agreement with some of Erica's points. As the discussion continued I felt myself drifting further away from her position. It felt like she was mainly trying to sell therapy. Erica recognizes that boys are being pathologized but then she pathologizes the solution to this problem. In her view bad therapies and bad systems create the problems, but then creating new ""good"" therapies and systems can fix them. I agree with your view that if people stop trying to break boys in the first place, in part by fixating on the world of therapies and labels, we wouldn't have such a large problem of having to fix them. Erica suggests that therapy is the antidote to being poisoned by these toxic systems while you (and I too) simply say: ""how about we don't poison the boys in the first place - then we don't need to use the antidote either.

While I wanted to agree more with Erica I felt myself drifting further away from her position and couldn't put my finger on why I felt that way. Toward the end her mask slipped and it became clear. When she made the statement that she didn't trust parents to know what's best for their kids she lost me entirely. And it looked like she lost you too at that moment but you politely allowed the interview to wind down without too much push-back on that.

I thought that statement about the role of parents was ludicrous. For two hours we heard how deconstructionists have created the chaos we see now in our schools and culture. We heard how parents who turn themselves into non-parents by being selfish, narcissistic or by abdicating their parental responsibilities to other non-parents, are the problem. The best solution is for kids to have two solid parents, a mother and father. But then by stating that she has no faith in parents, and wants to replace that role with a Utopian system run by an enlightened class, she essentially admits that she's for the deconstruction of the family. There is no greater act of deconstruction than the dismantling or undermining of the family and parental roles. 

I finally could see then why I couldn't get on the same page with Erica, in spite of wanting to so much. She has spent her working life as a priestess in the church of psychology and may feel that as long as kids are treated by people in her anointed class they may be saved. All other systems, classes, and the family too, cannot be trusted to be as competent at doing what the anointed therapy class can do. This is typical confused progressive Marxist garbage. 

How does the therapy class decide what is good and healthy for kids if they don't trust the parents? They decide on their own without the parents? Isn't this the very problem we have right now with the promotion of all the gender delusions in our schools? It feels too much like the invention of a new religion with a new anointed priest class that has decided it knows what is ""true"" or ""right"", but can only work if it can destroy all the religions that came before it. Deconstructionism.

Erica totally lost me on this. It is not for a woke academic to decide what is true or right, nor will they ever be more in tune to the needs of kids, and more motivated to meet those needs to the best of their ability, than that child's own parents.

Though I headed into this agreeing with the early segments, and by the end had some strong disagreements, I liked listening to this interview, and your others too. Most of my days the only conversations I hear are with boys under the age of 9 so spending a couple hours every now and then listening to one of my people helps me get my bearings back.üòÅ"
Saying psychoanalytic therapy is the only way to deal with mental health struggles is like saying that we only need oxycodone to manage disease. Simple fact is different therapies are useful for different things.
"ok right off the bat I have criticisms about some of the assumptions made here. the idea that more women go to college means that women got ahead and men are being left behind is a blanket statement that needs to be dug into more: are they going to useful degrees, or are they just accumulating tremendous student debt? what about trades? Are we just going to continue the elitist view that a tradesman is less than a university graduate, even if that graduate degree is in interpretive dance therapy? Also the idea that this adversarial attitude started with MeToo is basically the previous generation saying ""oh no, MY version of feminism wasn't adversarial, it's just this latest wave"" when in reality I see a lot of animosity in my parents' generation, stemming from this ideology that basically treats women as defective men. the adversarial attitude has been subtly pushed by media for decades now; think of the idiot dad trope. ""haha, this guy that provides for us on a single income is an idiot! laugh at him!"""
"They are not ""hating"" the ladies. They are demanding recompense and fair treatment. As they.should."
"""Do not participate in the hookup culture""

Ah, another amazing advice. In 2025 virtually all dating is hookup culture.
Then around the age of 32-38 about 10% of women wake up and desperately try to get themselves pregnant after a lifetime of hedonism, dozens of hookups, STDs, getting demolished by emotional wrecking balls, and so on.
Again the advice is to search for the unicorn - very useful, thanks!"

"Pro/Con of this episode: +) she acknowledges boys are in bad shape in current culture. -) she sees the only solution as therapy, the cause of this entire mess we are in. It nearly ALL leads south, no matter how well meaning the therapist and subject. Actions matter and need scientific/practical correction, thoughts/feelings are spiritual territory. These therapists are now the clergy. Mostly atheists teaching us how to handle our spiritual reality."
"Just removing quotas would solve the issue. Women didn‚Äôt knock it out of the park, you were granted special dispensation on an unprecedented level. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre in a slow motion collapse in direct correlation to your empowerment.

"Boys being held back, but why? And by who and what mechanisms? Asking questions like these gets you quickly labeled as an ‚Äúist‚Äù or ‚Äúphobe‚Äù. The sad part is, when you try to explain this to someone (especially a woman) they often don‚Äôt see a problem with it."
I liked the point about female superheroes being a copy and paste of their male counterparts. Made me think of why the titular character Nausicaa from the valley of the wind is so well written. She's the female ideal. She's a strong caring leader that inspires men though her refined feminine qualities.
"7:33 I feel like nearly everything she has said up to this point has been different from what I feel and my experience. Maybe it‚Äôs just me.

I‚Äôm not angry that my sons might be left behind. I‚Äôm angry that people have created systems which punish and reward people based on immutable character characteristics.

She acts like this stuff happened in a vacuum. Women just sprinted past men because‚Ä¶ They are just fast?   No. That‚Äôs not why men are upset. That‚Äôs not why women with sons are upset.

They are upset because 53% of all workers in the United States were forced to take mandatory DEI trainings.  They‚Äôre upset because society has been telling boys and men that they are inherently bad.  They are upset because of the demonization of males, opportunities have been given to females not based on the virtue of merit or character, but by the virtue of the junk between their legs and the idea that men are inherently bad.

That‚Äôs what people are upset about. They‚Äôre not upset about being out done.  Men are really good at understanding and taking place in a hierarchy.  People are upset that it hasn‚Äôt been fair.

And they are upset that this unfairness to do great harm to both sons and daughters and the future has been brought about by weaponizing people‚Äôs real empathy, but even more importantly, they‚Äôre upset that it has been done by corrupt people benefiting from just wanting to look/feel good and virtuous while being anything but.

But I think the things that she says after that point makes sense generally speaking.

I agree with most everything else she says, although I think I might phrase things differently, personally, that‚Äôs not something I think is particularly important"

"It‚Äôs interesting the female therapist asks for more men in her field to help boys yet by nature of a man coming into such a female-dominated industry, they have to accept Academic Post Modern notions which could be contrary to fostering Masculinity and discourages men being men and boys being boys.

"Ex Army JAG here. 38:15 is spot on; in my Brigade during 2020-2021, 40% of allegations were proven to be false . There were NO consequences for the false reporting since Command did not want to ""deter"" anyone from reporting.  It destroyed the lives of those who were falsely accused since the Army's culture is ""guilty until proven innocent"" (i.e. getting flagged, removal from favorable actions due to investigation, promotions suspended, schools suspended, etc. you are just stuck in limbo until it's all over (which could be up to a year). Approaching and making the first move has extreme risk attached to it since that movement."
"Women select, men struggle and compete to be selected. It's just men trying to navigate the social expectations that women impose. Men don't get to decide what those expectations are. We're never allowed to ask questions about women's expectations or their contribution to the given cultural arrangement, so there's just no solution. I don't know what to tell you."
There‚Äôs a program being introduced in UK schools to  combat misogyny in men and boys. I‚Äôd like to know how that‚Äôs going to help. It‚Äôs going to make men retreat from society even more . Doubling down with feminist misandry isn‚Äôt going to be taken well by men and boys.
"We don't have the issue that women kept running and men got left behind. Men were told we have to not only let women win. But we have to do the running for them. Round all the edges of competition. Blunt the sharpness of progress, and Tell men if they aren't willing to allow women to claim success during failure it is putting women down to make them feel inadequate. While not caring how hard men and boys try. They either produce or they are worthless. And telling boys the lies we tell girls don't work. Because that lie isn't enforced in the real world like it is for women and girls."
"I saw a therapist tell the Dad Saves America guy that men need to look for women who are emotionally healthy, that aren‚Äôt ‚Äúparanoid and persecuted‚Äù, and that aren‚Äôt afraid of their feminine side. I would say the same goes for guys‚Ä¶I had to learn this myself back when I came of age in the 90s and 00s, that a man needs to not be afraid of his masculine side too‚Äîhe has to have those good male qualities that give him confidence and conviction that avoids him falling into ‚Äúnice guy syndrome‚Äù, like you were saying. Men are at their best when they‚Äôre kind, but being nice is not a good place to be because you aren‚Äôt in touch with your masculinity enough to say no when you need to, or to express any negative emotions in healthy and appropriate ways. So there are plenty of messed up women and men alike, and both can work on themselves to improve, and they must also work on their ability to identify the emotionally broken people and the emotionally well people, and deal with their issues so that they are not attracted to the emotionally unstable persecuted or mean people who just bring chaos into people‚Äôs lives. And above all, men and women both gotta stop jumping on each other right away because sex makes all of this a million times more difficult‚Ä¶you‚Äôve basically bonded yourself to someone before you‚Äôve evaluated whether you should bond yourself to them."
"Calling boys ‚Äúfragile‚Äù implies a kind of inherent weakness or instability‚Äîlike they break easily and need protecting.

But ‚Äúreactive‚Äù is far more accurate and balanced. It describes a response style, not a flaw. It means boys might be more sensitive to stimuli, social dynamics, or emotional triggers, but it doesn‚Äôt frame them as weak‚Äîit frames them as more responsive to their environment. That can look like withdrawal, intensity, impulsivity, or hyper-awareness‚Äînot fragility.

And here‚Äôs something important:

Yes, biologically, boys are less resilient in early childhood. That‚Äôs not a flaw‚Äîit‚Äôs genetics. With only one X chromosome, they‚Äôre more vulnerable to developmental issues, neurological disorders, and complications early in life. Even into adulthood, women show greater resilience to disease and illness, while men tend to have greater resistance to physical trauma and injury.

That‚Äôs not opinion‚Äîthat‚Äôs the biological tradeoff.

But it‚Äôs often misunderstood or misused.


The reason ‚Äúfragile‚Äù gets used more often could be because:

1. Psychoanalytic language leans emotive ‚Äì It‚Äôs trying to evoke compassion, but sometimes ends up sounding pathologizing.


2. There‚Äôs a cultural undercurrent of framing boys‚Äô mental health through dysfunction or crisis, rather than development or adaptability.


3. ‚ÄúFragile‚Äù supports a caretaking narrative‚Äîbut at the cost of seeing boys as fundamentally broken, instead of complex and reactive to unmet needs, stress, or chaotic environments.

‚ÄúReactive‚Äù opens the door to deeper questions:

What are boys reacting to?
What expectations shape their expression?
What gets repressed or misunderstood?
What kind of support builds better responses?

She tries to point out bias narratives but then instinctively chooses not to reframe unfair narratives‚Äî id rather not to deny struggle, but to understand it and make room for strength"
The answer is ‚Äúmore top down social control‚Äù?
"The moment she said women were disempowered at some point in history so it was a good thing we empowered them, this tells me she believes the feminist revisionist history.

I would push back and question, were women actually disempowered? Or did they have all the power they needed to be women and they just weren‚Äôt satisfied with just being women?"
"When I was growing up in the late ‚Äò80s and into the ‚Äò90s, there were so many boys being placed on Ritalin. I didn‚Äôt have ADD; I was dealing with anxiety and a lack of interest in some of the topics we were covering. That problem has only become worse since then, unfortunately."

"Some questions. 

1: Given that so many modern women wake up angry and consider anger a source of power, I am curious about why they think male anger is so inappropriate. 

2: Boys and men are subjected to injustice, they are not treated fairly, rules are often tilted in girl's favour, I'd  like to know which other emotion is more appropriate than anger?

3: Do these people realise how unpleasant, joyless and exploitative the experience of dating modern women can be for the average man?

4: Do they understand just how pointless it is trying to date women who often have standards for men that gods cannot meet? 

5: Why do they expect men to meekly go back to a marriage model that even they know is totally broken, abused for personal gain, highly destructive and toxic to the family unit men are expected to build and protect?

6: It's true that a few men are angry at women, it's also true that huge numbers of men just find these women unattractive and this gets reclassified as anger, not disinterest, despite all the evidence that men are not pursuing certain types of women in the numbers that those women expect. Why aren't they seeing this?"
"Some men told us we have to work on us but we never heard someone told a woman you have to work on you, so they take pity and blame other, the government funds women, forced women to run and tight us on a chair by blaming us to warch the run. And women comes to spit on our face to not get on her standards and men we have to accept that behavior. Why men are divided to not support each other , level up together and help each other"

"That‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt commit anymore.  We work all day to come home to problems. Women today have the expectation that they will be a stay at home wife and the man is still supposed to work all day, pay her way through life, then come home cook, clean, and serve her because other single women on the internet deluded her into thinking that she‚Äôs a 10 when she‚Äôs a solid 4 on her best day.

The guest loses credibility when she minimizes the impact of divorce on children and tries to claim that the problem is that we just don't divorce well enough. That's simply not true.
"Christianity is the only religion that teaches other-centered behavior. And equality in marriage. That is what has changed in our society. Everyone is narcissistic in relationships. Never what we can do for our spouse, but what they can do for us."
"Erica seems very knowledgable and intelligent.  It's troubling to hear her speak of government as if it's an entity that has a role to play.  Government is nothing more that millions of individuals (many corrupted and perverse) claiming authority (illegitimate in most cases), and credibility (unwarranted in most cases).  One does not have to be a libertarian to recognize this.  What it does require is for parents, and society to take responsibility and stop wanting someone else to take care of them.  One could argue that part of why we face so many crisis in society results from a mindset of needing to be protected or taken care of (female/infantile trait?) by somebody or something else.  It's one thing to voluntarily take in information, or to take advantage of aligned resources, but it's completely unacceptable to claim authority to dictate.  I find Ericas assertion that individuals in government have the legitimate authority to tell me what I or my children can consume, and at what age.  It's this Erica mindset that delivers us into authoritarianism, and tyranny.  Good intentions or not, she is deranged and delusional, and this is precisely the sort of people we need to prevent from having power."
I think male hate is more common. I know lots of women who just casually say they hate men because they are bitter.
Women took on the male role of CEO but they refused to take in the role of provider.  That is the problem.
"She keeps on saying ""that girl is not a mentally healthy girl"". Yes, we are aware of that but it's not going to protect the boy from the charge of rape destroying his life.

"Vehemently disagree with you on Family court catastrophising.  I've been through it and fought only for my kids with a severely mentally I'll mother making every false allegation under the sun and they still awarded custody to her and my kids now no-longer speak to either of us.  The fact that the Court would not apply simple decency and consequences for her terrible behavior AND the fact that my experience is demonstrably and consistently repeated through the Wester world, shows a genuine lack of empathy and seriousness about re-promoting marriage."

"""Bad Dating advice for young men""   I watched Rocky with my son and daughter when they were older teenagers. The scene where Rocky stops Adrianne from leaving the apartment by putting his arm across the door was one of the most romantic scenes of the 80's. He loves her, she loves him, but she wanted to leave because of her own fear and insecurity. He pushed her boundaries, they fell in love and that became the main story line.  Both my kids felt he had crossed the line, and called it assault and ""kidnapping.""  He had no intention of hurting her but knew she had to get out of her ""comfort zone"" and move forward.  That scene is integral to the movie. Nowadays there would have been no boxing match as Rocky would have been incarcerated that night. Sad that youth cannot see that. And sad that women are seen as victims in every situation."
"The industry that I trained for routinely has networking events for exclusively women, non binary people, lbtq+ people, non white people. I‚Äôve never seen a networking event exclusively for white strait men, not saying that we need it; I‚Äôd personally prefer if there was no networking events based on identity, but even in the events that include my identity I feel looked over or outright rejected. Maybe that‚Äôs internalized self hatred I‚Äôve developed in my 24 years of living, but goddamn does it feel impossible to be a punching bag anymore especially when the product of a majority of larger companies are outright failing. It feels like I wasn‚Äôt given the opportunity, and on top of that the people that where are destroying the future opportunities I could have had."
"This podcast is the perfect embodiment of reality in general when it comes to discussions about boys and girls or men and women. The sentiment shifts from apathy to derision to blaming to pointless advise on how to become good enough again. 'If only you did well in school and college and became an investment banker and went to the gym and had a nice car and were fairly good looking, you won't be left behind by women and they will want you'. Even voicing the frustrations of one's failure to attract women is classified as being entitled.

I am not accusing either the host or the guest of harbouring any ill will towards men in general. All I am saying is that the way things are is not an aberration, it is the direct consequence of the deliberate choices made by generations to 'empower' women and just human nature. To some extent even those choices couldn't have been any different. We were always going to arrive at this point where we are now. There is a reason why feminism is a global phenomenon while men's rights movements are a fringe internet group. It was always going to be this way. If you were to reset the world and play is all over again, we will again come back to this exact same point because it is built into the human nature."
"Here is your problem - your understanding of hook-up culture and situationships. Hook-up culture and situationships are for successful men, not for the normal guy. A guy with choice will have women stay in situationships since committing to one girl would be a bad choice for him. If you are a woman, and you feel like the guy isn't committing to you, and you describe your relationship as situationship, it's most likely because you are swinging beyond your league. That guy won't ever commit, you are very likely his side-chick and not much more."

"I've never understood why people can't recognize the link between empathy development and present fathers. Empathy is an inherently selfless act as you're doing what you can to take on the position of someone who might be struggling (Sometimes quite badly) to better understand or help that person. Fathers, by definition, are selfless beings. The act of providing and protecting is selfless. We act in the best interests of others sometimes to great detriment to ourselves. Perhaps I'm just more aware or have a different understanding of this than others, but I wish more people recognized and understood this. Fathers are just as Important as mothers, but rn only one of those roles faces constant attack and neglect of recognition."
I like most of what this woman guest is saying except for the part that therapy is the answer for everything. Sounds a little self-serving. Especially for young men therapy is definitely not the answer. Mentorship from other men is what is the answer a young boy needs other men around him to figure out how to be a man.
"Why do these podcasters/influencers/whatever keep bringing on women to talk about men's problems, especially these big names that always get it wrong?"
"So I am a 56-year-old Christian woman who is married to a retired Air Force officer. We moved all over the country as my girls were growing up and thus became very tight-knit. Both of our girls lived at home with us until they married and moved out on their own, one in her late twenties and one at 30. I arranged my work schedule as a nurse to coordinate with my daughter's schedule when my first granddaughter was born 9 years ago. And that way one of us was always there to care for her so that she did not have to go into daycare. 2 years ago when my grandson was born I retired from the hospital entirely to be the full-time daycare for him and now have an infant granddaughter as well that I take care of. In the fall we will actually be removing my eldest granddaughter from private Christian school and I will begin homeschooling her. I maintain my nursing license should I decide to go on a medical mission trip or something like that, but I feel that I am much more of use to my family than to someone in the general public in a hospital. On top of that we moved my 82 year old mother in with us last year as she was no longer able to live at home alone. And I will not see her in a nursing home. All of this being said I know that quite often the younger generation looks at my daughters as not quite independent because of the direction of their lives. That being said they are both quite independent. Furthermore whenever we come in contact with anyone my age or older they always comment on how blessed they are to have me to help raise their children. And on top of all that, while I am busier than ever, I know that all this keeps me young because it gives me purpose. And my grandchildren are benefiting from constant contact even with their great-grandmother now. I am a big fan of multigenerational living."
"Being a therapist doesn't mean she's not a woman.
Caring about women and women's issues doesn't mean one can't reject feminism. Those two things aren't synonymous."
This is why the flexibility of homeschooling is optimal for boys and girls.
I agree with so much of what this woman says but therapy is not the solution. You can‚Äôt train therapists that will help with the current schools. Therapy programs are pumping out terrible therapists. She seems to have no idea of how bad the current schools are when it comes to training therapists. I got my masters in clinical mental health and did not learn anything of value

"I've commented similar on other forums about this. I work helping young men (18-24) build confidence, come out of their shell and be able to cope with everything life throws at you and be able to work on their own and in teams.

The majority see no future for themselves. Even if they work every hour they can it isn't enough to have a home and a family. Their girlfriends (If they have one) can't stay home and raise future kids like how their mothers could with them. For almost their whole 20 years on this earth they've been blasted from every angle with ""you're a toxic man, you're racist, you're sexist"" and who knows what else. I've seen 3 young men we work with end up taking their own lives as they feel everything is against them. The majority numb themselves with porn/alcohol/drugs/video games and as a society we are very lucky they do because if they didn't they could case some serious problems. 

We won't ever address the problem head on because it would mean having to deal with some of the big lies we've told ourselves for the past few decades."
"Because of YT censorship there's no way that I or anyone else can actually tell you what you missed, the half truths and the whole lies that were told and I personally am not even allowed to post more than one sentence any more."

"The ONLY reason women ""got ahead"" is there's a huge thumb on the scale.  Take your thumb off the scale.  See what happens."
She sounds like a great therapist. The only thing I have an issue with is that she's mentoring young men to go into a gynocentric based curriculum and career.
Men do well in groups... (First rule: We don't talk about Fight Club)
"I was watching a psychologist who explained how modern schools and society may be spending too much time encouraging us to explore and write about our emotions, potentially reinforcing tendencies to ruminate. Perhaps we could all benefit from learning stoicism to balance this. Excessive rumination can make it harder to properly frame situations and self-regulate, which might contribute to perceptions of narcissism, egocentrism, entitlement, or a lack of accountability in modern society. At the same time, people are increasingly drawn into emotional spaces, creating idle pressure and unrealistic expectations for constant recognition, praise, and support.

Some interpretations of empowerment movements amplify these dynamics, emphasizing validation of struggles without equal focus on accountability or emotional regulation. This can lead to an imbalance where people feel justified in externalizing their issues but aren‚Äôt equally encouraged to address them constructively. Meanwhile, others may feel pressured to suppress emotions and focus solely on problem-solving, leaving their struggles undervalued or ignored. These double standards can fuel tensions, as advocacy for fairness in emotional and societal expectations grows. This highlights the importance of addressing societal pressures and teaching emotional resilience, accountability, and healthy boundaries to foster more balanced relationships."
"I‚Äôm 50. My mom took off when I was 14.  Basically, I‚Äôve realized I need to make a life worth living on my own. I never had kids but find validation and fulfillment through engineering work. (At the very least it keeps my mind occupied).
It‚Äôs all about perspective."
This is all good news for handymen.  Lots and lots of women living alone that need things fixed. Men suddenly have value when the kitchen sink is clogged.

"Where can I report?

My landlord was ex navy. The navy doesnt prosecute rape. So the unwanted touches, gender based violence and stalking erupted into ritual abuse aimed at ruininh my life incrementally for some sick fetish. I see the innuendo in apparently ""harmless"" looking erotic videos for instance. But the undertext is a malicious serenity that could involve fetishes you can easily witness in virtual economies. Nightmarish experimentations and tech and biohacking. Ie: Neurolab

When I claimed to have unwanted touch by this 3 letter agency to the point of seriously altering my physique and payche, I was gaslit by many misogynists - told I wasnt ""special enough"" and dismissed as a ""victim"" by positivity spiritists.

 I dont want my comment censored because I feel my survival is a miracle during these times of #metoo and missing murdered indigenous women. My besties arent alive so I know they knew the same people. Can anyone help? I had a gun in my back too..the touch was frustratingly pernicious"
The ‚ÄòLee Millers‚Äô of the world have always existed. The milieu has changed and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening. Let‚Äôs not be tainted by movements and let it happen naturally by recognizing it for what valor. Would love to see more stories like Jane Addams come to the silver scene.
Men it would seem (by our nature perhaps) simply are unaware of their partner in a way that women are aware of the other person in the relationship. We are real to each other in different ways but equally respected

"I complimented a freind of my wife. She turned to my wife and said ""He's such a flirt!!!"" My wife came back immediately and said ""He's being charming and polite. Get over yourself"" love that woman."
Megan it happened to me 10 YEARS ago!! A peer that never wore a dress and the first time she did I complimented her. I found myself in HR for providing positive feedback!!!
Megyn you look very nice in your outfit üòÅ
I compliment my female employees for looking nice all the time . I don‚Äôt give AF.

"I am 69 yrs. I was taught manners and courtesy and respect. So when a woman finds it offensive that a man opened a door for her, I shake my head and wonder how society has sank this low. 
Btw‚Ä¶ my grandson is a freshman in high school and he apparently has his first ever girlfriend. Her dad saw my grandson open a door for his daughter, and that girl‚Äôs dad told my son at a wrestling meet that my grandson was the most well mannered kid he‚Äôd ever seen. so apparently it can be passed on from generation to generation and we need more of it."
I soooo totally agree with you megyn!
"Had a receptionist once, in a casual dress workplace. Shirts with a collar, clean jeans with no holes and track shoes were the norm. She never strayed from that and never wore makeup kept her hair in a ponytail.  After more than a year like this, I came in and did a doubletake when I saw her. Hair done up, makeup,nice dress,jewelry etc. I said, ""Wow. You look nice today."" I continued to my office and didn't think anything more about it. A week later I got a summons. She told the judge how ""violated"" she felt. I told the judge what happened. He looked at her and said, ""You need to grow y and learn what a compliment is."""
"Three years ago I got leaner and put more muscle. A female executive, stated you are looking real good. It was nice to hear . However I would never say that to female coworker. That would a HR compliant"
Make Compliments Chivalrous Again!
"When you actually listen, most of the stories are that petty. Women are raised to hate men therefore anything a man does that gives a woman attention that she doesn't want is bad even when the attention isn't bad and even if he can't know and even if she would like it if it was a different guy (again he can't know)

A good example of how women have lost their mind due to feminism is that video of a woman walks in new York for 10 hours and it claimed that smiling was harassment and so on."
I miss the compliments.
"I know a girl that reported her boss to HR because he said that the color of her new lipstick looks nice on her. 

I rolled my eyes"
So right on so freaking sad üò¢

"That girl is not offended by the guy who is six feet tall, makes six figures, and has a six-pack.    Her ""honor"" is not insulted by that man."
"One woman co-worker complained to HR for sexual harassment when one of the guys said to her ""good morning  - you look great this morning"".
HR warned him so the next day he said ""good morning  - you look bad this morning, are you ok?"". HR dismissed her following complaints"
I no longer complement women on anything. Never will again.

"I agree with you Meghan, it is a movement about someone's ulterior motives."
The best thing to ever happen to Megyn Kelly and Tucker Carlson was leaving FOX news and the mainstream media all together.  They are AWESOME unleashed!!!üòÇüòÇ
Megyn is gorgeous in her outfit and I would love to buy her dinner.
"I appreciate compliments!  BE MEN, MEN!  Screw the toxic whiners!"
It was never about the right thing ..
"As the ‚ÄúMeToo‚Äù movement began to gain momentum it made me think of the French Revolution. It started as a legitimate pushback against very real instances of oppression, but it quickly escalated to the point that any poor person could make an accusation against someone who was rich or in a position of power or influence, with no burden of proof. It‚Äôs understandable that the one making the claim is given the benefit of the doubt because so often there is no proof. However, the willingness to always believe peasant then or the woman today is that it creates an environment where innocent people are assumed guilty. 

Some women have ulterior motives. They may want revenge against someone who dumped them or wasn‚Äôt interested in them. Some want attention or money, or to get him fired so she or someone she loves can get his job. Sometimes it‚Äôs a case of mistaken identity. Sadly, many women have been sexually abused in some way sometime in their lives. It‚Äôs easy for them to be on the defensive and assume that men are dangerous, so they are predisposed to take anything a man says or does as sexual and therefore inappropriate. And then there are those women who are mentally ill, who may genuinely believe a man has abused them in some way when they‚Äôve never even met each other.

It‚Äôs simply not wise to automatically take one side or the other. Accusations need to be carefully considered case by case. Even then it‚Äôs sometimes not clear what the truth is.

I‚Äôm very glad to hear Megyn Kelly address this issue."
My ex sister in law would get upset over stupid shit like this. I never understood.
Society got way too sensitive and many wanted the attention that being a victim brings with it. Just my 2 cents ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

"I appreciate when men compliment me if I look good or if women compliment me if I look good, and I do the same to other people. It doesn‚Äôt matter the gender, if someone looks good, complement!"
"With most modern day movements, it had good intentions but went way too far quickly. I think that those people jumped on board the worse it got. The human experience: we just mess things up."
Yes!!!
So well said!
Does it matter if the boss is a female?
That's right ‚úÖÔ∏è
One of the first steps to handling sexual harassment allegations was informing the other individual that their compliments or action were unwanted.
"When ""you look nice"" became demonized I switched to ""You look tired"" women love that!"
Well said as usual Mrs Megyn!!
"Sadly, some people think others have a hidden agenda.  A compliment, most times, is just that.       IMO"
So true!
"Such a good explanation of how certain movements ‚Äòover correct‚Äô and the results of doing so, Megyn."

"It's like that joke, kinda.  Where a guy named Frank, was at the office water cooler.  A female co-worker was near him.  Frank inhaled deeply and said, ' Your hair smells beautiful.'  The woman stormed off, straight to HR.  HR said, so why was it wrong of Frank to compliment you, on how beautiful your hair smelt???
She replied, 'Frank, is 3ft tall!'"
Their goal was self enrichment not fighting any cause.
üò¢ Indeed... the 'TIME' to PAY someone a COMPLIMENT is while you are ALIVE ‚ù§Ô∏è!!!
"""Sexism,"" ""racism,"" ""harassment"" are getting more debased every second, and I love it."
I don't compliment women at all anymore to specifically avoid this kind of situation.
"They never intended it be ‚Äúnoble‚Äù causes. Their intention was to control how we think, feel, and do."
"Yes Female look good in dresses, that is a compliment !"
"When I was younger I was afraid to complement a stranger on their looks or attire, for fear that they would take it as me trying to hit on them. Now that I am an old man I do it regularly and watch as I lift their spirit."
Overcorrection. Absolutely rampant.
"Come on Megyn, we all remember that YOU were a big part of starting the me too movement.  I do have to applaud you for being one of the first news anchors to stand up and point out that things were getting out of hand though."
Impressive to see a public figure come out with what a moral social observer has been realizing. Kelly you are wonderful with justice
Also financially beneficial
Megyn Kelly looks fantastic in everything she wears.
I agree one hundred percent
"It's not what you say sometimes, but how you say it.  I have been told the same thing and got the same vibe this woman got, & I'm no feminist. So just because you never experienced it Megyn does not mean that someone else hasn't."
Love it
"How do we make this work? Many men don't understand that hitting on women can be completely unwanted and inappropriate dependingon setting, circumstances and a person. However a nice compliment isn't necessarily the same as hitting on women. I mean the guy could be complimenting in a creepy agressive way OR in a perfectly genuine and honest and lightweight way that isn't in any way inappropriate. This isn't so clear cut. But how do we solve this in a healthy way? I don't mind appropriate compliments at all. But I have received a lot of unwanted male attention that I rather would not have had to deal with. I think people need to learn to read the room."
"You are  totally right!
And Beautiful!"
Maybe she shouldn‚Äôt have worn a dress maybe she should‚Äôve worn slacks so it wasn‚Äôt so revealing
"I was in the Army in 1992.
We had to do a sensitivity and sexual harrassment training.
Being young adults we handled it like a bunch of juvenile delinquents üòÇ
But what has stayed with me all these years is how easy it is to be misunderstood, misinterpreted, or offensive when you simply meant to be complimentary or joking.
Offensive behaviour is in the eye and ear or the beholder.
What one person considers a compliment or a funny comment, another person may consider a personal attack.
And unfortunately, two people flirting consenually, may find themselves in trouble if an un-included third party observer gets offended by their words or actions.
That was in 1992.
Things have gotten so much worse since then.
I am surprised people speak or look at one another at all these days."
"A parallel universe in life. Two men, one ugly, one handsome can give the same compliment to a woman, and the woman will respond completely different to the two men. Ugly men get hauled down to HR in corporate America every day and handsome men don't. The way of the world."
"I loathe having to text this but I do not say anything to women anymore. I might say hello or good morning‚Äî you can get yourself in trouble lawfully for just being polite. 
  I‚Äôm 64 now, been married, single now‚Äîwhatever. A while after our divorce, I held a door for a lady to a business as i was exiting and she was about to enter. She looked at me with complete disdain and disgustingly said ‚Äúthat she was perfectly capable of opening the door herself‚Äù! 
  So I politely shut the door so she could open it  herself and I turned and walked away.
  A little embarrassed by that because several people were around and they stopped and watched.
  I will never forget that."
What he was really saying was ‚Äúappreciate you taking the time to dress professionally for work.‚Äù
"To disarm this...
ask the woman if she wears makeup to work.
When she answers ""yes"", you then ask her ""why?""
Then you get the ""zero divided by zero"" look."
I had a charge against me for complimenting an employee in her dress.
"1. What he said: ‚ÄúYou look nice in that dress.‚Äù
2. What she heard: ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôd look even better out of it.‚Äù"
Nothing new here. I retired from a big 3 company in 2002. I was a supervisor and by then had reached the point where I would say nothing to my female workers other than business. Never compliment a woman on her clothing. Women generally spend a lot in clothing - for what purpose? To be noticed? God forbid a make co-worker or boss mention that. I saw too many colleagues dragged in front of HR  for the most innocent of comments on appearance.
This is because there is a sense of glory in being a victim. It can pull sympathy from perfect strangers. This spits on true victims.
Really appreciate your time news.   My forvorite video üìπ awesome work cheers ü•Ç

There is good and evil in all of us.
I've Learned Not To Speak To Lady's.
Oh brother.
Remember when you were advised to complement people in the work force and in your family to be thoughtful
"When I was working in construction I commented to a woman in the office that we were both wearing kaki, only hers fit better because mine were carpenters pants nothing more. I was called in the office the next morning."
Tragically that's the way it is now. Men (myself included) are afraid to interact with women at least at work because we can be so easily destroyed. More and more men are refusing to even date anymore let alone commit to a woman. It's just too dangerous.
"I‚Äôm uncomfortable with the feeling of addressing people‚Äôs attire when greeting them and then they comment on my attire.  I‚Äôd rather exchange pleasantries without including how we look today. However on special occasions and when you are especially dressed, it seems appropriate to comment."
Because we're all too emotionally weak
"I almost always compliment women who are dressed up, especially my wife."
üíØ  true story being a bully
I miss the days of  just saying have a nice day to someone without the repercussion of that person being offended
"Like the soldier who kissed the nurse at the end of WW2? The woman came out and said ""No""! It was a joyous day, he didn't assault me ""! But they just had to deface the statue!"
It's gone so far I'm hesitant to even speak to a woman nowadays
"They complain when complimented on how they look, but then complain because a man didn‚Äôt hold the door open for her!!"
"Yep! But at the same time and breath!:

"Fourest : ""je suis journaliste""

Affirme des choses non sourc√©es et g√©n√©ralise abusivement des cas exceptionnels comme s'ils m√©ritaient un livre m√©diatique grand publique.

On a d√©j√† des discussions publiques dans les milieux militants et connexes pour discuter de √ßa et chercher des solutions et s'imaginer que des jeunes militantes et militants seraient pas arm√©s pour √©viter de tomber dans les abus c'est mal les connaitre.
Tout comme s'imaginer que si on est plus exp√©riment√©s on tombe forc√©ment moins dans les exc√®s ou les biais.

Alerter sur les abus c'est bien si c'est dans la nuance et traiter de fa√ßon proportionnelle √† la r√©alit√© du probl√®me mais pourquoi en faire un livre qui sert la soupe au publique r√©actionnaire ? Jamais √ßa ne touchera le publique qui pourrait b√©n√©ficier de l'alerte qu'on pr√©tend lancer et au contraire √ßa donne des pr√©textes et des armes aux antif√©ministes pour lutter contre le f√©minisme qu'ils n'accepteront jamais.

On peut percevoir des r√©action comme √©tant extr√©mistes ou dogmatiques alors qu'on est dans divers biais qui nous font voir des choses bien diff√©rentes de la r√©alit√©. Surtout quand on prend de l'√¢ge et qu'on se met a d√©consid√©rer les jeunes parce qu'ils seraient excessifs alors qu'ils n'ont rien de diff√©rent des pr√©c√©dente g√©n√©rations et que c'est plut√¥t l'observateur ou l'observatrice qui n'a pas sut √©volu√©e et progresser avec la soci√©t√©.

La position de Fourest semble tellement d√©connect√©e de la r√©alit√©, semble plus dans un raisonnement abstrait que bas√© sur des r√©alit√© mesur√©es et confront√©es a l'esprit critique pour √©viter divers biais dont un des pires est le biais de mod√©ration.

Bon il serait un peu na√Øf de croire que Fourest n'a pas l'intelligence et la maitrise sociale pour constater que son travail m√©diatique pose probl√®me d'un point de vue f√©ministe. J'ai du mal a croire que √©thiquement elle ne sacrifie pas (ou a d√©j√† sacrifi√©) certains id√©aux pour les b√©n√©fices mat√©riels et d'influence."

"Caroline Fourest parle en son nom,n'a pas la l√©gitimit√© de juger le bien-fond√© des plaintes,des proc√©dures et des actions du mouvement Metoo. 
Il y a une n√©cessit√© absolue √† :
- accueillir √©couter proteger et soutenir les victimes

"Je suis une jeune femme (24 ans), j'ai une amie qui a √©t√© agress√©e sexuellement par un homme, en voyant toutes les proc√®s de viol qui se tiennent depuis le mouvement Metoo, cela me fait perdre espoir en les hommes quelques fois (je ne vous le cache pas), mais je reste convaicu qu'il peut y avoir certaines d√©rives du mouvement. Il faut vraiment √™tre stupide pour le nier. Je suis certaine que la plupart des personnes en commentaires n'ont pas lu le livre, perso je suis en train de le lire et je peux vous dire que Caroline Fourest est une f√©ministe qui d√©fend les droits des femmes et les aide dans leur d√©marche √† porter plainte.
Je suis s√ªr que la plupart des personnes en commentaire n'en ont pas fait autant pour la cause des femmes. M√™me petite, Caroline Fourest a √©cout√© et aid√© une de ses amies quand celle-ci a √©t√© agress√©e sexuellement par son p√®re.
Mettre en doute sa loyaut√© envers cette cause est pour moi intol√©rable.

"Caroline Fourest est une meilleure avocate que Anne Bouillon qui ""ne croit pas"" la sincerite de Caroline Fourest qui pose de vraies questions si notre societe ne veut pas se transformer en tribunal sur les reeaux qui, comme nous le savons,  est un receptacle qui peut mettre en danger ses adeptes."
"Tellement d‚Äôaccord avec Caroline Fourest : on est rendu dans une soci√©t√© qui juge avant le tribunal, qui jette en p√¢ture des personnes avant que le jugement ne soit rendu, qui se sont retrouv√©s harcel√©s alors qu‚Äôils √©taient innocents.
Vraiment soulag√© de la prise de conscience du ph√©nom√®ne metoo, que les victimes d‚Äôagressions sexuelles soient d√©sormais √©cout√©es dans les commissariats.
Le probl√®me ce sont les prises d'opinions publiques sur l‚Äô√©motionnel pour faire le buzz, les jugements h√¢tifs avant m√™me le d√©but de la moindre enqu√™te ou que l‚Äôaccus√© n‚Äôait pu donner sa propre version des faits.
Bref oui au f√©minisme, non au f√©minisme extr√©miste ferm√© au moindre d√©bat."
"Bravo Caroline fourest, et courage, de te battre contre la b√™tise de masse. Quand l'avocate dit qu'il faut croire sur parole les femmes qui se disent victimes de viol, sans enqu√™te sans jugement ca ne choque personne ?
Elle affirme qu'elle ne""connait aucune femme qui accuserai √† tort pour salir une r√©putation..."" Merci de ton t√©moignage mais on s'en fou. Et donc on ne peut pas imaginer qu'une femme cupide sans honneur sans foi ni loi accuse un homme pour le plumer ? Ca ne peut pas exister?
Mais quelle faiblesse d'esprit. Il faudrait vraiment que les √©tudes sup√©rieures, basent leur s√©lection plus sur de l'intelligence plut√¥t que sur la m√©moire, ce n'est pas possible de voir de tels avocats, il faut arr√™ter de donner du pouvoir √† des gens avec aussi peu de jugeote."

"4:52: ""Dans 99% des cas ce Je t'√©coute doit √™tre un Je te crois"", Ok Caroline donc l'int√©r√™t de faire une livre sur les 1% c'est quoi exactement?

Le reste √ßa tombe en non lieu ou la plainte n'est pas d√©pos√©e (pour tout un tas de raison que MeToo a mis en √©clairage). C'est √ßa la R√©alit√© aujourd'hui."
"Fourest repr√©sente la d√©finition l'opportunisme. Elle sait tr√®s bien que certaines personnes sont fatigu√©es d'entendre la succession  des plaintes d'agressions sexuelles (qui r√©sulte de la lib√©ration de la parole) et se sentiront rassur√©es √† travers son ouvrage. 
Je lui repose de faire dans deux ans un ouvrage intitul√© ""Comment le mouvement me too a √©t√© √©touff√© ""."
"Parmi les ""victimes"" de d√©nonciation nomm√©es par C. Fourest, il y a un producteur de cin√©ma, A. Terzian, qui a vers√© plus de 200000 ‚Ç¨ √† C. Fourest pour un projet de film, qui -heureusement - ne s'est pas fait. Hasard ?"
"Madame Caroline Fourest, vous √™tes tr√®s courageuse, merci de prendre le parti de la nuance et de ce qui vous semble juste. C'est justement en denon√ßant les d√©rives du mouvement que vous renforcez son int√©grit√©, sa cr√©dibilit√©, son importance. Merci ‚ù§"
"Il y a clairement tr√®s peu de victimes qui sont mal intentionn√©es. En revanche, il y a des personnes, peu importe leur genre, qui ont des probl√®mes psys qui peuvent les entrainer √† imaginer, exag√©rer, m√©langer. Il y a des ph√©nom√®nes de foules o√π les gens portent des jugements sur des personnes dont ils viennent d'apprendre l'existence. Il faut donc s'interdire de n√©gliger la parole des victimes, comme √ßa a √©t√© trop souvent fait, parce que √ßa nous arrangerait. La parole des victimes est √† √©couter et √† prendre au s√©rieux. Mais √† l'heure des fake news, on ne croit pas aveugl√©ment, non."
"Une main aux fesses vaut 5 ans de prison alors que des centaines de milliers de dealers de coca√Øne se prom√®nent dans les rues tranquillement, relax√©s ou laiss√©s en libert√©! Cette avocate est une honte."
"Une main !!?? Pas une agression ,voyons.... plut√¥t un compliment ! Les affreuses ne risquent rien ! C'est tellement √©vident. üòÇüéâüéâ"
"Caroline Fourest a raison de questionner le mouvement ""me too"", ses possibles d√©rives et sa r√©cup√©ration √† des fins parfois politiques/√©lectoralistes. Quand on sacralise un sujet, il n'est plus permis de le questionner et c'est alors la fin de la d√©mocratie. Merci √† elle pour, une fois de plus, son courage et son audace."
"Si un homme, ou une femme, venait voir cette avocate en lui expliquant qu'on l'accuse √† tort de harc√®lement, j'aimerais conna√Ætre son sentiment."
Mais c'est vraiment si compliqu√© de comprendre ce que dit Caroline Fourest ?
comparer une main aux fesses au viol de mazan c'est quand m√™me pas tr√®s respectueux pour cette pauvre femme qui en a √©t√© victime - il n'y a plus de nuance .
"Pour quelques uns accus√©s √† tort, contre 94% de plaintes pour viol class√©es sans suite, je sais o√π est mon camp."
Les commentaires n√©gatifs face au simple appel √† la nuance en dise long sur la soci√©t√© actuelle.
"Pourquoi tant de violence envers Caroline Fourest, c'est un point de vue int√©ressant qu'il faut avoir l'honn√™tet√© d'√©couter et essayer de comprendre avant de le d√©molir"
Caroline Fourest üòäüëç
"Les cons√©quences de son livre vont √™tre dramatiques. Les femmes ont tellement gal√©r√© √† se faire entendre, et elle, elle d√©barque de nulle part pour dire des conneries, alors qu'elle se pr√©tend journaliste ! Tu ne te pr√©tends pas de droite, mais tu vas √™tre tr√®s √©tonn√©e d'√™tre appr√©ci√©e de ce c√¥t√© d'un coup. Le m√™me discours que Tha√Øs Escuffion"
Pour qu'il y ait abus de pouvoir il faudrait que le pouvoir soit de notre c√¥t√©.
"je ne suis ni pour l'une ni pour l'autre mais pour les victimes et toutes les victimes des deux cot√©s.
Ne pas vouloir admettre et concevoir que certain(s) certaine(s) puisse(nt) instrumentaliser une accusation en faux. C'est la m√™me chose que g√©n√©raliser et dire que tout les hommes sont des violeurs. 
La lois ne pr√©voirait pas le d√©lit de diffamations et de faux t√©moignages si tout le monde disaient la v√©rit√©s"
"Bravo Madame Fourest, toujours dans la nuance et d√©masquant les revers de toute d√©mggie."
"Il faudrait que cette avocate se renseigne davantage sur les fausses accusations (en justice ou par la voix m√©diatique) en France et ailleurs, il y en a un bon nombre disponible en quelques clics."
Et ben tout √ßa parce qu'elle veut mettre un peu de nuances...√ßa en dit long sur la soci√©t√© actuelle...
"Fourest qui trouvent normal que les bombardements isra√©liens provoquent des d√©g√¢ts collat√©raux, trouve inconcevable que certaines accusations sont le fait de femmes malades et tout √† fait minoritaires. Et du coup ce petit nombre qui doit √™tre condamn√© justifie de discr√©diter tout le mouvement f√©ministe et Meetoo en particulier."
"Tu vois, l'affaire M'bapp√© est un bel exemple de ce que Fourest raconte. C'est devenu un peu facile, le viol est devenu une arme par des gens mal intentionn√©s, et cela dessert ceux qui sont vraiment victimes de viols."
Bravo et merci √† ma√Ætre Bouillon
"Je comprends tout √† fait le malaise ressenti par Madame Fourest pour le vivre moi-m√™me sur les forums de discussion. D√®s que vous essayez de prendre un peu de recul par rapport √† un sujet quelconque et d'y apporter de la nuance, d√®s que vous refusez de prime abord de hurler avec les loups en somme, on vous soup√ßonne de faire partie de l'autre camp. Vous vous faites accuser comme si r√©fl√©chir constituait un d√©lit. Il semble difficile pour beaucoup de sortir de la vision simpliste et rassurante du camp du Bien contre le camp du Mal..."
Caroline Fourest est brillante et je salue son courage face aux contresens permanents de ce qu‚Äôelle d√©nonce. C‚Äôest une v√©rit√© de dire qu‚Äôil y a des hi√©rarchies dans les abus que subissent les femmes. Mettre de la nuance et de la pr√©cision apporte au contraire de la force au mouvement meetwo qui est le mouvement soci√©tal le plus important depuis‚Ä¶ouh‚Ä¶. Il n‚Äôy a jamais eu un mouvement de soci√©t√© aussi important. Je pense que les deux femmes sont d‚Äôaccord mais l‚Äôavocate est partie bille en t√™te en faisant un faux proc√®s √† la grande f√©ministe qu‚Äôest C. Fourest. C‚Äôest dommage.
Oui faut condamn√© s√©v√®rement les pointeurs mais c'est pas simple quand c'est parole contre parole sans aucune autre preuve et c'est pas au m√©dias de jouer au procureur comme madame rousseau qui d√©nonce bayou a c a vous sans plainte n'y rien sa rappelle staline ou les d√©lateurs pendant la seconde guerre mondiale
J'admire cette journaliste qui essai d'√™tre objective.
"""les femmes ne mentent pas plus que quiconque"" ...et donc mentent autant que les hommes. Tout est dit ! Bravo Caroline Fourest d'avoir le courage de porter un discours de r√©flexion et de nuance, face au militantisme politique partisan, dont notre soci√©t√© a besoin ! üëå"
"La duplicit√© de Fourest consiste √† ce que d'un c√¥t√©,dans des d√©bats comme ceux-ci, on entend quelque chose d'√©tay√©.

D'un autre c√¥t√© en revanche, son livre fournit aux pourfendeurs r√©actionnaires de Metoo un argumentaire pour etayer leurs propres id√©es. Et c'est cel√† que diffuse un tel livre dans la soci√©t√©.

Et cela, elle ne met pas d'√©nergie √† venir le corriger, au contraire."
Honteux la mani√®re dont Catherine Fourest se victimise
"Je trouve les commentaires sur Caroline Fourest passablement delirants et donc inquietants...croyez vous vraiment que cela mette en danger le mouvement ""me too"" et pensez vous reellement que "" me too"" ne puisse pas etre interrog√© ? Pourquoi ?"
pour moi on est coupable quand on a √©t√© juger coupable  par la justice !!!!! la vindicte populaire non merci !!!!!
"Enti√®rement d‚Äôaccord avec Caroline Fourest!
C‚Äôest beau de voir une femme faire une ¬´¬†not all men¬†¬ª üòÇ
Sa r√©flexion a du fond. L‚Äôinstrumentalisation parfois int√©griste du mouvement ¬´¬†me too¬†¬ª pose question."
"Merci Madame Caroline Fourest pour vos propos et √©crits , √©quilibr√©s ."
"8:00 ""Les femmes ne mentent pas "" effrayant. Une illumin√©e."
"Caroline Fourest ne fait que nous pr√©venir et nous alerter sur les retour de b√¢ton potentiel, comme elle l'a toujours fait . Et honn√™tement je pr√©f√®re que sa vienne d'une f√©ministe que d'une personne qui est contre ce mouvement . Le point essentiel ce n'est pas de ne pas croire les victimes mais de r√©fl√©chir, pour les journaliste, √† la m√©diatisation d'une affaire qui au font n'en n'est pas une, et ainsi les 1% vont d√©cr√©dibiliser les 99% restant .
La preuve en est que nous pouvons avoir des d√©bat entre Humaniste, et qu'il n'y a, pour le moment, pas de d√©bat contre ce mouvement mais juste contre ces d√©rives potentiel"
"on dirait que tous ces gens n ont pas entendu parler de l affaire d outreau, et de ces vies gach√©es,car la parole des enfants etaient sacr√©e et le doute ne devait pas exister"
Une avocate √©coute avec inqui√©tude un discours qui rappelle √† la prudence devant les accusations ! La justice est entre de bonnes mains.
Madame l'avocate ce n'est pas parce que ca ne fait pas partie de votre quotidien que ca n'est pas une realite.
Oui mais c √©tait pas 1 pouceüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇEDF
Merci madame
"Les n√©o-f√©ministes ne comprennent pas que le combat de Fourest est au contraire hyper utile pour le mouvement meetoo, car les anti meetoo se serviront toujours du moindre √©cart et de la moindre instrumentalisation du mouvement."
Je trouve que l‚Äôinterview coupe trop souvent les invit√©s
"Elle raconte n'importe quoi sur Outreau, les victimes, encore aujourd'hui maintiennent leurs accusations"
"J'ai toujours admir√© Caroline Fourest pour son courage. Ici encore dans son nouveau livre, elle prouve qu'elle n'a pas peur d'aller √† contre-courant de la bien-pensance ¬´¬†MeToo¬†¬ª qui √©rige la victimisation en norme.  Pour moi, ce d√©bat est biais√© d√®s le d√©part. Face √† Caroline Fourest on a une avocate dont le business est de d√©fendre les victimes, aussi bien les victimes qui ont subis une r√©elle agression sexuelle ou un viol, que celles qui sont en mal de reconnaissance, qui cherchent plus prosa√Øquement un gain financier ou qui sont inconscientes de leur ambigu√Øt√© vis √† vis des hommes. A ses c√¥t√©s on a flanqu√© un journaliste m√¢le pour donner une caution masculine au d√©bat.
Plut√¥t que de d√©fendre l'id√©e qu'il est toujours salutaire de prendre du recul et d'avoir un regard critique vis √† vis de toutes les formes de croisades, la r√©action de ces deux intervenants sous-entend au contraire que c'est un crime de l√®se-majest√© que de remettre en question la victimisation de certaines femmes."
"Caroline Fourest a toujours les bons mots et les bonnes explications qu'il faut, et en plus elle est courageuse"
"Caroline Fourest est une journaliste (dans le vrai sens du terme, pas ce que les journalistes sont devenus) et est objective. C'est fatiguant de voir des pr√©sentateurs r√©sumer un livre de 300 pages √† une phrase. Elle apporte de la nuance et de la r√©flexion, alors que les d√©bats de t√©l√© cherchent √† faire du fast food ""vous √™tes pro-machin √† 100%"" .... non, mais je pointe ""ah donc vous √™tes anti"".......Caroline Fourest, j'aime √† penser que la majorit√© des auditeurs entendent la nuance de votre r√©flexion. Merci encore pour votre travail"
"Comment a t‚Äôelle pu oser dire cette phrase √† Caroline Fourest ? Pour une avocate, on ne peut pas penser que √ßa lui √† √©chapper comme √ßa oups pardon hein‚Ä¶"
"Juste ta gueule Caroline, je crois que c'est la bonne expression, et faire de l'argent avec, je trouve √ßa pitoyable !"
Merci pour ce partage d‚Äôid√©es.
"Il est inutile de discuter avec elle.Un peu comme avec les Cons.Incapable de changer d'avis,de remise en question,de m√©a Culpa."
"Je suis √©tonn√© qu'elle √©crive un tel livre, et j'en suis ravi qu'elle l'ai fait. 
Je suis constern√© par la r√©action des journalistes d'une v√©rit√© si juste rejet√©e."
"Le courage de la nuance et de la r√©flexion chez Caroline Fourest, face au catastrophisme de l'id√©ologue militante bien connue Anne Bouillon... Bravo ! üëç"
"Incroyable Caroline, magnifique analyse et d√©fense anti-d√©magogue. Un plaisir de vous √©couter."
Elle zoom sur moins d'1% des cas et probablement moins pour en faire un bouquin. C'est tr√®s inqui√©tant. Elle fait son business sur des cas de niche.
"Cette avocate est born√©e. 
La d√©marche de Caroline Fourest est rationnelle et responsable."
"Beaucoup de sottises,  peu de rigueur intellectuelle,  un opportunisme √©hont√©  ,  pas mal de mensonges et d'approximations ,mais quand va - t - on cesser d'offrir des temps de plateau √†  Caroline Fourest d√®s qu' elle nous fait un petit caca  nerveux afin qu'elle en fasse son beurre ?"
"Le r√¥le de l'avocat ce n'est de faire √©merger la v√©rit√©. L'origine du terme est celui qui porte la voix.

Croire et douter c'est la seule posture intellectuelle qui permet de tendre vers la v√©rit√©."
"Bravo Caroline, enfin un peu de raison"
"Non. Non et non. Les pr√©sum√©es victimes, je refuse de les croire sur leur simple parole. 
J'ai le devoir de les √©couter, voire de les aider √† prouver, etc. 
Mais les croire a priori non.
Elles sont pr√©sum√©es victimes jusqu'au jugement coupable d'un pr√©sum√© innocent. 
Si on sort de √ßa, on sort de l'√©tat de droit."
L'avocate a fini de me convaincre d'aller acheter le livre de Caroline Fourest
"Bonjour,
Ce qui me saute aux yeux lorsque j'entends ces deux personnes debattre c'est que leurs propos collent parfaitement √† la fonction de chacune.

La journaliste d√©sire apporter un √©claircissement sur un sujet de soci√©t√©. Elle se d√©fend de denoncer abusivement un auteur de d√©lit ou de crime en pronant la mod√©ration et en se laissant le temps de la r√©flexion avant d'engager sa parole en jetant un nom d'auteur de ces infractions dans l'ar√®ne.

L'avocate, elle, accueille toutes les paroles de victime et ne les remet pas en question, c'est normal. C'est sa fonction d'avocate, elle defend quoi qu'il arrive et d√©l√®gue la decision au magistrat qui aura √† juger la chose.

Le probleme, √† mon avis, est de proposer un debat entre ces deux intervenantes dont, a priori, les avis ne sont pas conciliables pour les raisons expos√©es.

Ou plut√¥t d'opposer √† Mme Fourest, puisque c'est son livre qui est le sujet de l'√©mission, une personne qui ne peut soutenir une autre voie que celle de la d√©fense sans distinction des personnes qui se designent comme victimes de ce genre de faits."
Quel courage Caroline face a cette meute wokiste! Tout est dans la nuance.
"Ouaiiiisss, elle est contente Fourest, elle a r√©ussi son business, et les m√©dias qui l'ont tous re√ßus l'y ont bien aid√©e."
Caroline est nuanc√©e et r√©aliste. L'avocate fait son beurre sur les outrance langagi√®re. J esp√®re que ses consultations sont gratuites et qu elle ne vide pas les poches des victimes pour plaider?
Le feminisme a geom√©trie variable...
Tout mon soutien √† Mme Fourest. J'appr√©cie beaucoup son positionnement √©clair√©.
"Le ""Je te crois"" est une parole prononc√©e dans le domaine de la foi, du religieux. C'est la soumission √† une parole divine qui ne peut souffrir, au risque d'√™tre excommuni√©, d'une remise en cause, un questionnement, un d√©bat contradictoire.  La formule est inappropri√©e dans une affaire o√π les f√©ministes r√©clament justice. Puisque pour rendre la justice, il faut qu'il y ait un d√©bat contradictoire qui am√®ne la preuve mais aussi qui conteste les faits.  Et s'il est tellement difficile d'aborder la justice avec des affaires d'agressions sexuelles, toutes les parties, en ce y compris les avocats, doivent se questionner sur le r√¥le syst√©mique qu'ils tiennent dans cette institution."
Tr√®s courageuse Fourest de chercher la nuance sur un sujet aussi casse gueule !
"Elle a raison, Madame Fourest. Peut-on prendre une seule de ses paroles pour dire qu'elle a tort ?
Par leurs exc√®s parfois psychotiques, les ""Me Too"" sont du caca qui d√©truisent les rapports entre les √™tres humains."
"Cette avocate Anne Bouillon est √† vomir quand elle ose sortir cette phrase √† 8mn 45sec ! Qu'un jour elle se prenne une accusation calomnieuse et tout ce qui se passe ensuite avec la rumeur qui peut aussi tuer, et on verra la t√™te qu'elle fera !! ü§¨üëøü§ÆHeureusement que Caroline Fourest est l√† pour r√©pondre et rappeler entre autres l'affaire d'Outreau et comment ont √©t√© broy√©es des personnes totalement innocentes !"
Catherine Fourest aurait pu se dispenser de cet ouvrage.
"bravo √† Caro, comme toujours parfaite de justesse"
La honte le test de l‚Äôascenseur ! On en parle des petites filles qui ont pris l‚Äôascenseur avec le gr√™l√© ???
Catherine Fourest contrairement au vin...vieillit mal !
"Les r√©acs parlent toujours de pr√©somption d'innocence (ce qui, dans le cas de viols, signifie ""pr√©somption de mensonge"" de la part de la victime, soit dit en passant). Le souci de la justice, c'est ""surtout ne pas prendre le risque de condamner un innocent"". C'est tr√®s louable, personne ne songerait √† critiquer cela. Mais on ne parle jamais du risque de ne pas condamner un coupable. Et donc, de condamner la victime √† voir son agresseur impuni, et son statut de victime non reconnu. Jusqu'√† la fin de ses jours."
Pourquoi elle √©crit un livre sur ce sujet ? On s'en fout. √áa fait avancer quelle cause ? Aucune. Caroline Fourest est hors sol.
"""Les femmes ne mentent pas"" ?? Ce serait pas un mensonge √ßa madame ? üòÇ"
Elle veut faire du buzz et de l‚Äôargent ‚Ä¶ l‚Äôinviter sur tous les plateaux participent √† diffuser une parole naus√©abonde qu‚Äôest la sienne dans tous les sujets qu‚Äôelle traite‚Ä¶
D‚Äôaccord ok et du coup on fais quoi ?

va bosser
"C'est partout pareil. On mute le probl√®me, on ferme les yeux. Entre la communication et la r√©alit√© du terrain, il y a des victimes encore et encore. Les agresseurs dont promus et les victimes placardis√©es."
Il faut vraiment travailler pour que √ßa change. Il y en a marre de mettre les soucis sous le tapis !
Eh bien...quelle d√©ception
Pas de fille a l'arm√©e sauf a l'infirmerie
"Un sujet tabou dans l'arm√©e mais pas nouveau. Parmi les mesures je propose notamment de saisir le Conseil de l'Ordre National du M√©rite pour retirer la d√©coration des hommes qui ont perdu leur honneur en agressant des femmes, avec publication."
People obsessing about the fact Diddy had sex with men kinda makes me think about how people treat rape in prison. They offer it up as another form of punishment because as men we often feel that it wont happen to us. Rape is often about power and there are some twisted men out there that are not gay but are hell bent on expressing their power over you.
"People are highly motivated not to understand coercive control as a dynamic, because recognizing it fundamentally upends the way that our society has viewed certain sets, the nature of crime, victimization, and power... And would force us to reckon with how much our lives are full of coersion."
"Thank goodness for voices like Taylor, Caroline, and Kat on these matters. Truly appreciate the work all three of these women do!"
"15 years ago when I was a freshman in high school, Ia remember seeing writing on our bathroom walls about Chris Brown and how ‚Äúhe can beat me any time‚Äù and how Rihanna ‚Äúdeserved‚Äù it. I cant believe we‚Äôre going back to that"
"Babe, wake up, Taylor is horrifying us with education again."
My ex husband used coercive control on me for 15 years. No one suspected a thing. He turned everyone against me when I left. I'm glad to have survived. I almost didn't survive. My love goes out to everyone who has been subjected to any type of abuse. Mutual abuse is not a thing and reactive abuse is also not a thing - that's victim blaming with extra steps
lol this panel is a misogynist‚Äôs nightmare i love all three of you. thank you taylor üôèüèº
The Taylor Lorenz/Kat Tenbarge/Matt Bernstein cinematic universe is my jam.
"thank you for mentioning Chris Brown. the support this man gets is disgusting and I will never understand it. as she said in the video he is a known abuser, why are people still supporting him? this accepted mistreatment toward women is disgusting and i'm not here for it at all."
"I'll never forget the first time that I listened to a lecture on sex trafficking. The presenter said ""Many people who are trafficked go home and sleep in their own bed that night."" People just fundamentally don't understand it, somewhat because they hate women, but also because they just LITERALLY don't get it."
dreading the impact of the trial's outcome and what it may lead to for future SA and DV cases
"I'm old enough now to see this 15 year cycle with celebrity women where they go from the young, hot icon to making progressively more explicit art/media to unpopular, to smeared, to clearly having unhealthy coping mechanisms like drugs and having very public mental breakdowns, and later learning which powerful man was abusing them the most when it's way too late to do anything about it."
Caroline! Yay! So happy to see Caroline here and hear her thoughts on this üòä
I can‚Äôt say what a relief it has been to find your channel and hear you talking about these topics. It‚Äôs so frustrating to see even people educated in DV who don‚Äôt see the parallels between all of these cases.
"The 2018 Grammys pretending to care about the me too movement, then giving Ed Sheeran‚Äôs shape of you the Grammy‚Äù for best pop vocals‚Äù over Kesha‚Äôs praying, then making her perform the song live after losing is when I knew the movement was a joke. I‚Äôll always be thankful for Rose McGowan, Kesha, Cassie, and the many others for their bravery, but I will never forgive the industry that did this to them then pretended to care."
"YES! Completely agree on the pop culture affects politics, I hate that we're dismissed for talking about this stuff as it's ""women's issues"" as if we're a Completely separate, annoying issue which deserves to be sidelined. The way so many women I've interacted with who have horrible internalized misogyny because of women like Candace Owens is honestly shocking"
"The Heard Depp trial was one of the worst things to happen to women outside of the repealing of Roe v Wade.
As a survivor it was absolutely traumatic to hear other women talking about Heard and victim blaming."
"13:00 I appreciate you journalists sharing information about domestic abuse because it does help audiences with understanding cases of abuse in their own lives. I remember that growing up, the police frequently showed up at my home due to domestic abuse/IPV against my mother by my father. She was a 5‚Äô 4‚Äù chronically ill stay-at-home mother with a history of mental illness and he was a 6‚Äô 4‚Äù truck driver with regressive views on many things including gender roles. Once when things got heated between them both and my mom returned aggression with aggression, she got overwhelmed and called the police and since neither party acted with perfect innocence, my mother ended up spending the night in jail. After my mother died, my father went on to abuse both me and my sister and his next wife blamed the problems in their marriage on us. This is how abusers evade the consequences for their actions over and over and over again. Please keep up what you do. You all speak truth to power."
It's such a relief to know that people like yall exist and are actively having these conversations on a public stage.
As a teacher I‚Äôve had to stop using Kahoot/Quizlet and use random names on Blooket instead because reliably there will be at least one student every time who will call themself Diddy
"While I don't like Blake Lively, I can admit Baldoni did start a smear campaign against her to bury the allegations. My bias against her made it easier for me to believe Baldoni but once I actually looked at the evidence, like the messages between the two, I changed my mind."
I feel like this country has moved so far right since 2021 that things that were unthinkable in 2017 or 2020 is now happening pretty commonly.
Such a harrowing subject but great collaboration! I love Caroline and she is so intelligent and entertaining
Thank you for speaking up about this. this topic is too triggering for me to engage with rn but i really appreciate the work you & others put in to un-silence the voices of victims and survivors!
"In regard to Depp V Heard, I remember Johnny Depp‚Äôs supporters would ridicule Amber Heard. Some of the things they ridiculed her for is: 

‚Ä¢Being a single mother
‚Ä¢Being homeless and relying on Johnny Depp for a place to stay after the divorce 
‚Ä¢Sleeping with someone after their breakup 
‚Ä¢Making an SA accusation 
‚Ä¢Defending herself

When I look at that list I personally see a vulnerable woman. When someone else looks at that list they see damaged goods. 

There was no empathy extended to her. People pick apart the right and how to de-radicalise them but here it seems the issue wasn‚Äôt the information they had but how they processed that information. 

What we really need to start asking ourselves is how do we encourage empathy when there is none?"
"The Racketeering may have been a stretch, but the trafficking was pretty slam dunk.  I can't understand how the jury acquitted him of trafficking."
"Thank you! Excellent conversation as usual. You and your guests always put into words the stuff I notice and ""feel"" but just can't articulate. I enjoy circling back with friends on these topics and being able to explain better my views and reactions to news cycles and ""the monetization of misogyny"" (thanks for that one)."
"Thank you ladies for a great discussion. 
I was a misogynist woman until my early thirties when I went back to school. A class in women‚Äôs studies was the beginning of my intellectual change. Learning to love myself as a female was another imperative beginning to break out of woman hating. I was a misogynist for many of the reasons you stated. I wanted to be on the ‚Äúwinning‚Äù team because it was clear women were the losers in patriarchy. I didn‚Äôt even know what patriarchy was. I had to read When God was a Woman to get it. 

Misogyny was fed to me through entertainment like I Love Lucy. By the time I was in my early twenties I had seen so much disparagement of women through media, our bodies as smelly, our emotions were infantile, our thinking was trivial, our conversations were vapid and unimportant‚Ä¶all of that I took in on a subconscious level and then complimented myself of how I wasn‚Äôt like ‚Äúthem‚Äù trying to gain favor in the eyes of men by shitting on women. I attempted to raise myself in the hierarchy like crabs in a barrel. What is CRAZY is that I had been sexually abused and assaulted since childhood through my young adult years BY MEN WHO HATED WOMEN!! I must have had some variant of Stockholm syndrome to not be able to tie it together as a result of misogyny and patriarchy. Because it was and is  invisibly entangled into culture. We swim in it every day. 
There has to be such a complete revamp in order to change the tide BUT capitalism favors men, is geared towards males whether it‚Äôs a product sold to women or sold to men, it‚Äôs still about what will be pleasing to men! They are the CEOs, the execs, the decision makers and the consumers with greater spending power. 
I think the solution is women who wake up to the cultural misogyny need to stop having sex with misogynists, whether they are women or men. Animals isolate other animals that are antisocial. Why not try what works in the animal kingdom."
Celebrity trials have always been political. Fame gives wealth and power. The law protects power.
"I would argue it isn't just sexual violence that has been normalized, but all forms of social violence have been normalized."
Oh hi Caroline Kwan! Glad to see these minds weighing in together üíú thank you all
"Unfortunately, I was one of the people who was swayed by ""mutual abuse"" discourse when Depp v Heard was on going. My whole tiktok algorithm was belittling/making fun of Heard and supporting Depp when the trial first started and I feed into the algorithm. After the whole trail I watched Kat and Matt's video and one more content creator's video about Amber Heard tittled how she was the victim. Those two videos made me realize I was an idiot and I am 100% susceptible to propoganda. I will forever carry the shame of participating in that misogyn slop in me but I am happy to announce that I learned from my mistake and you guy's video and now when it comes to women who suddenly get all these hate (Cassie, Blake Lively, Rachel Zegler, Megan Markel, Megan thee Stalion) I take a step back to see what is the source for this sudden surge of hate is and I am always suspicious of the presented reasons for the hate campaigns."
"If Diddy weren't a celebrity, the public wouldn't have the same reaction, nor would Diddy receive the same sentence. The fact that so many people can use fame as a shield to avoid accountability and consequence is appalling."
"I think of my mom who I talked to before she died about why she was so critical of her daughters, herself, and other women around her, especially when it came to ‚Äúrespectability‚Äú. She felt immense guilt about it at the end of her life, and had realized that it was her own way to try to keep her daughters safe and protected. If she and all of women could just fit in enough then they would be safe from being ostracized and isolated, which makes any woman more vulnerable. Ultimately though it‚Äôs just a fantasy, and you never have true freedom if you require permission and approval from people who are bigoted or biased against you."
"Absolute BANGER of an episode. You're killing it, Taylor."
"It completely infuriates me how people never believe women. They didn't believe my mother, they didn't believe me, they didn't believe my sister, they didn't believe my friend. Even when there is evidence upon evidence, people will bend over backwards to defend a male abuser"
"Great conversation! Also, correcting yourself publicly is so important and laudable, especially when misinformation is so rife on the Internet these days."
and the tech industry using algos to amplify these dynamics and monetise them. These digital platforms need proper and evolving regulation.
"Thank you for weaving Sabrina into this, I feel like I'm going crazy seeing everyone hate on her for ""feminist"" reasons"
"Thank you so much for covering this. I love your work and your medium;  you cover such important topics, write excellent scripts, and have engaging guests on, and make everything digestible to the common person. ‚ù§"
"Thank you all for the work you do, it means so much to our collective understanding (and our mental health!) üíñ"
"I've started to notice when these hate campaigns start how confusing they feel. 

With Blake Lively, I was shocked that someone cared about the press of the movie. I grew up with a tv channel called Lifetime, and it was wall to wall mellow dramatic domestic violence stories. On top of that, the way murder cases involving women are talked about, you would think there was no domestic violence or sexism involved. A man killed his wife for money, or he wanted a divorce. Before that, they had the perfect life. Holding Blake Lively ro a higher standard is just bizarre. She was even held to a higher standard than the woman who wrote the book."
"17:58. What's not to understand?  I grew up watching Johnny Depp and loved his movies, but even I was like ""what an a$$hole"".  No normal nonabusive man jokes about putting his girlfriend in the trunk on his car.  She didn't even say his name when venting about abuse. He went after her financially and ruined her career because she mentioned ""someone"" abused her. WTF

I don't know enough about the evidence of Lively / Baldoni . . .I do acknowledge men get the benefit of the doubt and women get hated more.  But I don't think she deserves hatred in the meantime . . .while evidence and witnesses are spoken about

Also, Woody Allen got away with calling Mia Farrow ""crazy"" for trying to protect her daughter . . .even though HE married her other daughter whom he also abused.  Just sick"
"I was wrong about Depp v. Heard for about a year, and that is something I will freely admit. As a survivor myself I am ashamed that I fell for the PR narrative. But the desire to do right by my fellow survivors outweighs that shame. It sucks others can‚Äôt do that. It definitely made me way more critical of the sensationalism around trials, especially celebrity trials.

Thanks for the video Taylor, Kat, and Caroline! Great and thoughtful as always ‚ù§"
Caroline Kwan letsgooooo!
Does the general public even have a clear understanding of what sex trafficking is? I remember watching a YouTuber talking about how she almost got sex trafficked and I was horrified because it initially sounded so mundane
"THANK YOU for touching on the sabrina carpenter thing. as a woman i feel like the message the internet is telling me with this whole thing (and it's not just this, it reflects a broader cultural shift towards swerfiness and pseudofeminism) that if i choose to express my sexuality publicly, i will be criticized not only by the puritanical right for being too slutty but also be accused by a large portion of the left of being anti-feminist. THAT is setting women back, not her album cover."
Shout out to Medusone for making videos regarding the DISGUSTING way Depp v Heard was covered by nearly everyone
The Amber Heard case was definitely a cultural tipping point. In my own life I also had both men and women disagreeing with me vehemently when I would try and talk about the weird mysogny that was taking place in the media. It felt like people were being brain washed into their opinions.
"Some good news from all this: I, and MANY women like me, saw how much the internet was fueling the cultural shift these days, and how much the internet was run by men, and decided to enter the fray and be heard. For myself, I decided to troll the trolls; I made this account, I anonymized it (that's right, COME FOR ME bros, you'll never figure out who I am) and I devote a lot of my online energy towards relentlessly making gamer dudes who go after women's days just a little bit worse. It makes me feel powerful, and reminds me that the internet is the ultimate equalizer, it does not mater on here if you are big, or rich, or white, or male, the best comments win üôÇ To anyone who feels like you are losing hope; you can do something, your voice matters, and there's more women than men on this Earth, if we ALL speak up.....we got this!"
3 queens discussing the fall of civilization
This is exactly why we still need Me Too as a society and it's on us men to keep amplifying it.
"12:55 Attorney here: the ‚Äúreasonable doubt‚Äù thing doesn‚Äôt come from a belief that both sides are bad. It‚Äôs a fundamental piece of our legal system, that is intended to protect the accused. If the prosecution can‚Äôt prove that the crimes charged were committed ‚Äúbeyond a reasonable doubt‚Äù, the jurors are instructed that they cannot find him guilty if they still have doubts, based on the facts and testimony that were presented at trial. I do acknowledge that a direct result of that legal doctrine is that the public viewpoint then switches to ‚Äúboth sides are bad‚Äù ‚ÄúCassie isn‚Äôt credible or she abused him too‚Äù but that‚Äôs people letting their assumptions run wild, and ignoring or being unaware of the research-backed understanding we have today of abuse and control dynamics. It‚Äôs NOT the law saying that she‚Äôs also responsible or an abuser. Important distinction."
"As I kid I was a 2Pac fan and I remember hating Puffy back then. As that beef went away, I no longer hated these people and even disliked hip-hop beef culture. But I found out just how much of a monster he was, I wish I hated him more back then. It's just proof that hip hop or rock and roll, Hollywood or DC, rich and famous men in power turn into monsters."
"I'm always torn between ""this is a matter of power structures and education around abuse"" and ""it's grotesque and inappropriate that so many people are obsessed with the abuse these victims went through."" I don't engage with any of it if I can help it, because it feels like the reasons people are obsessed with it are very much the wrong reasons."
"I never actually thought to look into the details of the Heard/Depp case, I just assumed that it was a case of a man not being taken seriously for being the victim of abuse. Thank you for raising awareness! Empathy is being able to value and understand the experience of someone else, even when it doesn't align with your own experiences, and empathy is required to make a positive impact on the world."
"What's funny to me is there is sooo much drama in the muscle guys community it's insane, male creators whose main content is the drama itself xD but if a woman did that it would'nt be seen the same"
"This was enlightening.. I was one of the people who was not at all interested in any of these trials because ""there's more important stuff going on."" 
Thank you for another banger of an episode"
"Men are almost infantilized in abusive situations. Like Depp was a poor little guy, he's just quirky and he's went through all this stuff, and Amber was so lucky to have the opportunity to take care of him.  If she hadn't been so mean he would have been her little puppy, and all those women just know they personally would have done it right and the opportunity was wasted on Amber."
"Really interesting conversation, thank you all for talking about this and speaking out against misogyny"
Social media == personalized tabloids
"How likeable someone is plays a huge factor in how much they are believed. Depp is seen as far more likeable than Heard. Cassie is more likeable (or at least sympathetic) than Heard and Lively. Diddy has been disliked by many for years, including a strong suspicion that he had something to do with prominent deaths. It's insane to me that we had video evidence of extreme abuse in the Diddy case and people insist it was a consensual sexual relationship. Yuck!"
"It's so distressing how so many people just don't care about sexual violence. I never, ever want to hear about how ""everyone believes victims"" again"
"I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs meant by leftists in this context. But as a socialist / communist; I clearly understand why these cases matter, despite wanting to eliminate the entire concept of celebrities from humanity if I could. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt follow them beyond a show like this because the gossip / drama YouTube accounts don‚Äôt appeal to me. But that‚Äôs why journalists like Taylor and guests who do bring these cases to the attention of a different audience are so important.

It would definitely be ridiculous for people to suggest that it‚Äôs irrelevant and just a story for women. Or it‚Äôs beneath them because it‚Äôs gossip. Or whatever the reason given."
"Just speaking from personal experience with past abusive relationships... As a victim, what can end up happening is you are basically cornered and trapped by extremes. There were times where from the outside I looked like the most toxic abusive person in that relationship. But the details of that relationship pushed me to more and more extreme behaviors because I was so consistently unsafe, violated, not respected, boundaries were not a thing. It took me a long time to grapple with that fact because the person I was in that relationship is the opposite of what I want to be or have strived to be. 

There is also a perpetuation in the mental health sciences that blame victims... It's less obvious now but there is a deeply rooted mysoginistic factor to the DSM. Borderline Personality Disorder (PBD) is an extremely common diagnosis for victims who have endured abuse. It is especially true for those with CPTSD. The diagnosis makes it about that individuals behavior when the issue is the trauma and how that affects their behavior. This whole ""well they are both toxic""... That behavior I described of being explosive and looking from the outside like the abuser, this is very commonly diagnosed as BPD. It's a behavior that manifest as a result of abusive situations and extremely high control situations. The majority of time when people seek help, it is the victim, because abusers do not see themselves have being the issue. 

So yeah I find it sick that this is the narrative. It's one of the reasons I never pursued criminal charges, among the other factors like people not believing victims, and justice largely not being carried out in these situations. This is just another example of this. And fun fact, so is the Epstein scandal. Why aren't the victims being interviewed and believed? Why are the perpetrators getting off on charges, having their names redacted in files etc. It's sick."
Amazing collab. 3 of my favorite commentators ‚ù§
Appreciate your videos so much Taylor!‚ù§
"I'm not US based so the discourse and facts arround the case are perhaps not as clear to me, but when it comes to the sex trafficing charges: didn't Diddy basically deploy a variant of a loverboy approach? How known are lovereboy tactics in the US? In my country there was nation wide education programms starting ~10 years ago bc of increased frequency of cases and people now recognize that you can be trafficed by your romantic partner."
"Please could yall do an analysis on Pharrell, he legit intertwines with all the controversies and I haven‚Äôt heard anybody talk about him. He has worked many times with Diddy as a song called Diddy, he‚Äôs good friends with Gwen Stefani, he jump started Justin Timberlake career. Raised 60 million dollars for Israel. Has two legal disputes over Chad and Kelis music. Has a song called blurred lines which is about not asking for consent. And he put rose parks face onto a k pop stars underwear for the met gala. Like he‚Äôs just getting more success and praise, it‚Äôs just so strange nobody‚Äôs talking about it."
"The trial verdict was a slap in the face to SA victims and horrific upholding of rpe culture.

As with Obama becoming president and the Black Lives Matter protests, there was such visible progress being made with MeToo a lot of regressive people and hateful bigots got so freaked out at any sign of change they dug their heels into harmful existing power structures even more."
"My husband was all over the Depp trial but, when it came to Diddy he just said ""yeah, I can't watch that..."". For him the Depp trial was entertaining. It was something to grab your popcorn and Michael Jackson meme over. The Diddy trial though, that was too real for him. It wasn't entertaining - it was disturbing."
"Some of the same reasons people kick down at the poor. They are weaker, have fewer resources, and have fewer strong friends who would come to their aid."
really enjoying what you have been doing on here lately
I do agree being called Perez Hilton is the ultimate insult
"Always good to see Kat in your videos, but Caroline is new to me, and I loved hearing her perspective on how she covers this kind of news. All three of you come to this conversation with nuanced political analysis and a moral clarity that is so refreshing to see. Keep up the good fight!"
"So on the T.D. Jakes portion, this is an example of lazy research. T.D. Jakes is not a ""random preacher"" and the connections between Diddy and Jakes is deeper than just SEO connections. Jakes was one of Diddy's spiritual mentors and Diddy has publicly associated with and thanked Jakes. That is not to say that Jakes did anything nefarious but it is to say that there is more to the story and that is what fueled the more extensive algorithmic manipulation and public interest."
"27:56 Go Kat Go! 

Love the purple headphones and the best argument/rant ever."
Great video. Still reeling from the surprise Brace Belden appearance and now u give us Caroline üòç
Big fan of Caroline
It's encouraging to see you all doing this work! Thank you!
this was such a great video. great work taylor
"Posting a comment for the algorithm because more people need to get their news from smart, well-researched women ‚ù§"
"Yes, it‚Äôs exhausting. But so appreciated and so necessary. Thank you so much for the work you do. If even one person understands it‚Äôs worth it."
so so SO grateful to find out that there are women in the creatorsphere that believe amber heard!!
"I love Laura Richards, she's a true hero. Great video."
Amazing video Taylor!! This was so nuanced and had me consider my own unconscious biases. The point about women also having a significant hand in uplifting misogyny is such an important point.
"Content creators are establishing a troubling precedent, acting as willing tools in smear operations"
Another great episode. Thank you
"Caroline, thank you SO much for calling out SWOOP's behavior."
"These three gals work so well together! Nice work, everyone!"
Great convo. New concepts for me. Thanks. ‚ÄúPolitics are downstream of culture.‚Äù So great to hear this discussion.
"THE GOATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The collab i never knew i needed, love Caroline"
I've just never understood the mindset of believing someone would go out of their way to falsely accuse someone of such a crime when the odds are so stacked against them. What is the perceived benefit in doing that? Riling up right wing support for the accused who then viciously attack the claimant? People honestly don't think deep enough about the the follow through in these kinds of beliefs
another amazing discussion! :D
Thank you for doing this video. We need this.
"Great episode. It's important to talk about this every time because people are always having their eyes opened. As someone who barely paid attention I bought into the Depp/Heard narrative about mutual abuse but had my mind changed, I think by an episode of A Bit Fruity, so by the time Blake Lively starting getting hate I didn't fall for it that time"
Amazing episode. Bring them back
Also Taylor lol Caroline wasn‚Äôt talking about Megan Markel when she said Meg. She was talking about Megan Thee Stallion‚Ä¶.
what a great video üëè i have so much respect for these brave women speaking their minds
I love public drama. But like... The low key kind where two KnitTok creators are beefing over accusations of pattern theft
5 ans avec sursis et 5 viols ? Apres on s'√©tonne qu'on porte pas plainte... Justice a la con !
Interdiction d'exercice et interdiction de poursuite des √©tudes m√©dicales.

Il y a tellement de m√©decins qui sont des pr√©dateurs mais je trouve que c'est assez tabou encore m√™me si les langues se d√©lient.
On peut √™tre interdit de territoire dans tout un d√©partement  ???
"Pourquoi en tant qu'infirmi√®re, dans nos √©tudes et pour chacun de nos emplois, on doit fournir un extrait de nos casiers judiciaires et pas les m√©decins ?"

Bizarrement ont voit pas les racistes qui nous disent encore un kevin ou mateo. Jne chance pour la France. Radi√© point!

il ira en Hongrie ou Belgique pour terminer ses √©tudes et exercera en France.

Scandaleux.

"Je ne comprendrais jamais pour quelle raison en France personne ne se positionne en faveur des victimes. Mais quel est leur probl√®me ?

Quand on sait ce qui est qualifi√© ""d'agression"" par beaucoup de victimes, on prend peur pour leur sant√© mentale."
Qui prot√®ge cet √©tudiant ? Et surtout qui prot√©gera ses futures patientes ? Notre syst√®me judiciaire est une honte.
C'est compl√®tement dingue cette histoire
Le laxisme des responsables judiciaires et de nos fonctionnaires en charge de respecter leurs missions et au service des citoyens.

D'accord donc le mec √† 5 plainte pour agression sexuelle et vous le mettez en gyn√©cologie gg gars
Alors la c fou... comment il faut se battre pour se prot√©ger et etre en s√©curit√©
"J'adore l'argument ""oui mais c'√©tait pas de le cadre de ses √©tudes""... Ben oui parce que c'est bien connu qu'un gars qui sait pas se tenir en dehors de son √©cole va se tenir quand il aura plus de profs et un permis d'exercer... en particulier dans une profession o√π il sera face √† des femmes √† moiti√© nues et vuln√©rables...

5 viols c'est pas juste un malentendu avec une copine pendant une soir√©e, c'est de la perversion √† ce niveau l√† et c'est dangereux de laisser ce mec exercer dans le milieu m√©dical. Si on refuse les gens avec des casiers judiciaires dans la fonction publique, il y a une raison et pour les m√©tiers de la sant√© √ßa devrait √™tre pareil.

D'ailleurs je comprends pas non plus qu'apr√®s 5 viols reconnus le gars ait pas une obligation de soins parce que √ßa va clairement pas dans sa t√™te."
Incroyable...
Honteux üò¢ belle justice si elle existe üò¢
Quand on voit qui est son avocat On se demande de quelle communaute
Ont veut son nom ?
"vive la justice du pays des droits de l‚Äôhomme , elle fait honte a beaucoup."
La bonne question c'est qui est derri√®re (papa ou tonton) pour qu'il soit aussi prot√©g√©.
"Pour le coup il est n√©cessaire de diff√©rencier vie professionnelle et vie priv√©e, un crime commis dans un milieu n'a pas forc√©ment d'influence sur l'autre. Si √ßa avait √©t√© pendant les examens r√©alis√©s l√† oui il faut faire quelque chose, si c'est en priv√© c'est totalement diff√©rent."
"Pour info, son avocat √† d√©fendu nordal lelandaisü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ"
"D√©j√† il n'a pas √† √™tre vir√© de son travail si ces faits ont √©t√© en dehors du lieu de travail. Ensuite il a √©t√© reconnu coupable, donc il devrait aller en prison si ces faits sont en l'√©tat des viols. Si les faits ne sont pas reconnus, rien. Si ces faits sont reconnus : prison .. c'est pas compliqu√©."
"a une epoque pas tr√®s lointaine, les etudiants se seraient occupe de son cas sans l'aide des tribunaux!. Un petit coup de bistouri au bon endroit, et le probleme est resolu."
il faut donner son nom et sa photo un point c'est tout. Comme √ßa il se sauvera loin pour se cacher
J'ai travaill√© avec le Cabinet Jakubowicz
"Waouh l'argument de l'avocat ""oui i la viol√© mais ce n'√©tait pas dans le m√™me contexte donc ca compte pas"" ??? 
Dans ce cas on ne peut *jamais* priv√© quelqu'un d'acc√®s, ni m√™me l'emprisonner, car le contexte change toujours (au pire il y a la temporalit√© ""c'√©tait avant"").
Bon apr√®s c'est le boulot de l'avocat de d√©fendre sont client, mais le Juge ! Comment a-t-il put accepter cela ?"
"On vit dans un monde ou des personne qui vole de largent de quelconques maniere prennent plus de temps de prison que des violeur en tout genre.
Cest a ce moment la quon sait que largent dirige le monde et pas le coeur."
Prendre de l‚Äôargent √† l‚Äô√©tat et plus grave que de violer une personne si la justice continue √† √™tre autant b√™te il y‚Äôaura plus d‚Äôagresseur que de dealer

"I drove a Taxi for many years.  And I helped many women get out of an abusive relationship and to a shelter where she and, usually, her kids, could be safe at last.  I know first-hand how hard it is to get away from an abusive man, so when someone named Twigs says she could have bought a plane ticket any time, it makes me mad.  Most women trapped in abusive relationships don't have that easy out."
"Rest in peace, Tina Turner. And thank you for everything you‚Äôve given us."
Tina stayed with Ike for 16 years before she left‚Ä¶
Fear is a powerful tool. It can take time to build the courage to make the move you need to make. An abuser will weaken you that is their game. In the beginning if you sense something is wrong it is. Get out early before it gets worse.
"Thanks, Bill for telling people ""just to leave,"" an abusive relationship. Don't think they ever thought about that!"
"Post separation abuse is VERY real and often way WORSE than the abuse experienced in the relationship!!  Abuse is all about control and when a victim leaves, it harms their ego and amps up their need for control.  There are MANY cases of victims who have left their abuser only to end up dead. So it‚Äôs not so simple to ‚Äújust leave‚Äù an abuser."
"For the love of god fire that guy that always says ""yeah"" to everything. He does it in every monologue and it's annoying as hell"
"As a woman who has been abused, there is a psyhologial effect that happens to the point where you even gaslight yourself. You can't really believe that someone is doing this to you, you wonder so many things  Abuse damages your mind and unless you have gone through it you won't ever understand it, these are facts."
The most dangerous time in an abusive relationship is when they try to leave.
The audience ‚Äúyeah!‚Äù guy is the new audience ‚Äúwooo!‚Äù guy.
It's like you can hear the applause light sparking on and off
"I left my abuser, it was sure a lot easier than staying. Then I get a call recently form his current wife of 15 years that she's leaving. Surprise! he didn't change, the victim just did."
"Like when Bill offers parenting advice, I will file this one in the ‚Äúout of his depth‚Äù category."
"All these people/women telling Bill he is not a woman and has never been in an abusive relationship should accept that they are not men, and have never been in an abusive relationship from the man's standpoint. Abuse comes in every shape and form, right? A lot of men are being abused in very subtle and twisted ways too, and are being held fully responsible for their reactions (which I agree they should) while the other party is never held accountable... Go ahead, I am ready."
Tina was with Ike a long time before she left. This is not an issue and problem to be so easily solved. If only it was so easy.
"The most dangerous time/highest mortality risk for a woman in an abusive relationship are when she's pregnant/having a kid, and when she decides to leave. You don't know what threats Cassi or other victims had hanging over their head. But thanks for being the new expert. For laughs. Well done."
"Most women trapped in these relationships weren't selected by accident. There is usually something in their past that primed them for it, and reactivated, prevents them leaving, especially if they were childhood abuse survivors who literally depended on their abusers to survive. This can have lifelong effects on agency.

Also, you can't discount the strength of coercive control, the extent of gaslighting that affects your reality until you believe you are the problem (especially if your trauma response is Flight or Fight), the constant C-PTSD scrambling your brain and leaving you sleep-deprived til you can't think your way out, the fear of retribution, old, destructive trauma responses such as Freeze or Fawn which actually put you back into harm's way or means you just just shut down or placate them without realising, or put yourself in harm's way to save your kids. 

All trauma messes with executive function, which is the thing you need to plan and pack. You could have had all the agency in the world before you got abused but if you can't think or make decisions, you won't get far alone. And this is while you're trying to work out if you're 'overreacting', as your partner tells you, or you imagined it, or you're going mad, or it's your old trauma causing it or changing how you see it, or you took it the wrong way, or you started it, or deserved it, and all the other counter-narratives they'll tell you to stop you going. And that exists in a sexist soup of people telling you women who leave are manipulative, man-hating gold-diggers.

Then there's codependency, financial abuse, the lack of social circle because the abuser cut your ties with people, so you may have noone left to turn to, and outside of shelters, probably don't have anyone who understands. Or the dopamine hit in the DV cycle where victims start to rely on the ""I'm sorry"" phase to make everything better.

I'm so tired of hearing the 'why don't women just leave?' argument from people who are judging from a place of ignorance and essentially, privilege. If you don't get it because you could plan and pack up, you could think straight. you have self-esteem and financial resources and you see yourself as an independent person, you aren't in the same boat. To many abused women, that's like an Olympic athlete wondering why you don't just run fast enough to get a medal."
People who never been a victim of domestic violence don‚Äôt understand and never will. Victims are manipulated and isolated. Their lives are at risk when they try to get a way.
"He‚Äôs leaving out the psychological effects of the abuse, how it twists the mind of the victim."
"If only it was that simple...
Unfortunately, oversimplifying a subject doesn't make it so."
"Bill Maher strikes me as the kinda guy who tells women ""oh just calm down, youre so emotional"" and then gets dumped"
Unfortunately a lot of women in abusive relationships were also abused as children and it takes them a long time to realize they‚Äôre worth more.
"I experienced childhood SA and have been a part of many support/therapy groups for survivors. Of the people who went to the police, 0% were helpful. CSA is different than being abused as an adult, but I still doubt that most police departments are helpful in these cases. People often still blame the victims or do very little to help."
Great I never thought I would see Bill try to be a therapist for abused women. Victim blaming is not the solution bill. What about all the young boys that were abused for decades until we finally uncovered the systematic cover-up and abused by the church. Should they have spoken up earlier as well?
"This is great advice for the high profile cases of the MeToo movement. Unfortunately for those women and yes men who are in toxic relationships who came from a toxic family it‚Äôs not quite as simple as Bill makes it out to be. 

My mother was in an abusive marriage to her second husband. The only reason we got out is he locked us out of the house. I was 13 at the time and when I saw her being thrown out of the bathroom I went across the street and called the cops (and then they called his mother who lived a street behind us), they didn‚Äôt really do anything other than have him unload the .357 revolver that was under his driver side seat. I had to go to the store with him and he told me ‚ÄúNext time I‚Äôll give you a reason to call the cops.‚Äù 

Some people who are in these types of relationships think that‚Äôs the best they deserve and have no where to go and no one to turn to especially when there are kids involved and especially if you live in a neighborhood that is very religious and protect their own as we did. 

So yeah, while Bill makes it sound really easy it‚Äôs actually not."
"100% right! If you are being mistreated do not stay. Its crazy that someone files a complaint 15 years later and we are expected to take their word for it. You can't do that when it comes to racism, police brutality, work mistreatment or for anything else on the planet. Much less still be sleeping with the person, somtimes initiating the behavior in question, taking their money, and going on trips with them--RIDICULOUS!  Stuff like this makes it harder for women who are true victims."
You have no idea the mental and physical power an abuser has over his victim
Just this week my town had not one but two cases of women murdered by the exes who didn't appreciate separating
"I find myself agreeing with Bill Maher on just about everything these days. One of the things I've hated about the Me Too movement is the infantilization of women in certain situations. Listening to a woman claim that she wasn't responsible for a one-night stand because she was ""verbally coerced"" is the pinnacle of pathetic. Just because you regret a decision doesn't mean you have the right to abdicate responsibility for it. Equating casual flirting with actual rape is also completely unhinged. I genuinely feel bad for men these days because feminists have turned every interaction into a battlefield. The actress Brie Larson whined about having to be on ""the defense"" because a guy asked her for her number. Complaints like that undermine the very real issue of sexual violence. Crying wolf over these type of situations conditions people to ignore or question the veracity of accounts of sexual violence."
"Abuse doesn't always start at level 10. It can build over time. I witnessed this happen to someone i wont mention. As a women, it may be your preganant and the abuse starts. Or after having a kid. 

Then you think about leaving but cry because, where will you go, how humiliated will you be, how will your children see you?

How many of them may blame you for the divorce, for the strugle after?

Yes, today is easier to get help and get attention, but abuse is mental and phsyical.  If you dont have income but have people dependent on you, you have that stress added on top. Plus maybe child support or visitations for your children. So you have to watch your children be around your abuser. 

A single women with her own income, sure. Same for a man. As a man, i had an abusive girlfriend. Developed over time. Alcohol was what triggered it. I cared to try and help and suffer through it but I eventually said no and walked away. 

But i had nothing tying me down, good income and we werent married. So as a man, it was easy and a choice i made because it affected me. 

But many women have to think about their children, how they will provide. How long they will have to fight in court, find a job, take care of the kids all while having to worry about how they are treated when they visit the husband. And even if the women gets away.

Say she wins in court, he is arrested, put in jail. The income is gone, the mental strain of explaining to your kids, family and friends. The embarassment you might feel. Then, who knows, your own kids blame you. Thats probably the worst.

And this can happen to men as well, just not as comon but can happen. 

If your a grown adult, are not dependent on a spouse, then walk away if they abuse you. Thats easy. Especially if your rich. 

If your low income, have kids, bills etc. Not so much."
What about the grown men 2x the size of Cassie and probably stronger than Diddy who admitted that their silence was due to fear of what Diddy would do?
I watch on mute at this point and read subtitles.  The fake audience reactions are getting worse.
"Abuse is horrific but you don‚Äôt need to send text messages expressing you are ready for the next time. 

Very good monologue as hard as it may be to swallow."
I‚Äôm an abuse victim and speaking from experience it really isn‚Äôt that easy for most. I have kids involved and that makes it 100x worse
I see that Jake Tapper was a guest. Did he mention his new book 10 or 20 times?
Provocative essay. The issue is parents don't teach their sons or daughters to not put up with abuse. You have to actively teach this
"Kids, money, fear of being literally murdered when you try to leave‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ there are still reasons why it takes some time to get out of DV situations safely."
The ignorance and arrogance of Bill Maher lecturing and shaming women for staying in abusive relationships. I've been a fan of the show for years but not after this.
"Tell me you don't understand abuse without telling me you don't understand abuse, Bill."
"Always great to see a guy tell victims of abuse they need to set better boundaries with their abuser (or leave the relationship. Even tho they fear for their life and are being perpetually psychologically conditioned.) ... Life is just a lot easier to do when your really rich, giving you options of moving, being able to pay a lawyer to defend yourself in court.... I just don't get how anyone thinks it's fun to dunk on victims of abuse?"
I don‚Äôt think he understands how real world works.
This is so wrong Bill! You are not taking into account the challenge of recognising entrapment perpetrated by a powerful person.
To paraphrase: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt fit my definition of the perfect victim then you don‚Äôt deserve to have your experience heard.‚Äù
"You may not remember this, but just 50 years ago, getting a divorce was a radical, push back against family and church and society. And abusers are everywhere. In your family of origin, the workplace, church, general public. Women should be protected. 
In P. Diddy‚Äôs case, as well as other high-profile cases, the situation is extreme. The benefits to staying are enormous and the reasons against leaving are huge. Unrestricted and unaccountable violence, public shame and blacklisting."
"Sorry Bill, you're on the wrong side of this issue.  Kids sometimes don't have the finances or support to leave.  They may have children or dogs they don't want to leave behind and need time to make arrangements.  And abusers often find ways to alienate people from their supports prior to escalating to physical violence.  I agree with you when it comes to people who are very well off, but even then there are sometimes circumstances which make it difficult or even seemingly impossible.  Abusers can threaten to harm loved ones if you leave, and violence is most likely to happen when the victim leaves or threatens to leave.  Most murders of spouse's happen in those circumstances."
"You have no idea, Bill.  Stay in your own lane."
"It's easy to tell someone else that they just shouldn't put up with abuse. But things are not black and white. I was in a relationship where everything was great at first. But bit by bit, he started becoming controlling, manipulative, and demeaning. It was so gradual that I didn't recognize it as it was happening. (I also wasn't sure at the time if it really was abuse because he never hit me). The thing is, the manipulation can basically brainwash the person and the abuser isolates the abused from friends and family. I had lost my sense of self and didn't know anymore how to live without him. Even after we finally broke up, I had to work with a therapist for months to undo that damage."
YESS BILL SOOOO TRUE!! This needs to be said more TO BOTH WOMEN AND MEN. BUT WOMEN IN GENERAL
wow bill maher just solved domestic abuse cases worldwide. what a genius
The moment he brought up metoo you could hear a needle drop in that studio.
As a rape victim who faught kicking and screaming and other rape victims that I know I believe we can all agree collectively we find the me too movement infuriating to hear that women who didn't leave when they clearly had the choice to do so are now the real victims. This we do not understand.
"Guys like this keep coming after you. Coercive control is also very real. There's a reason dogs don't just run away from their owners even if they're off leash and have the chance to make a break for it. There's a reason cult followers don't see the abuse or the many chances to escape until they've left. This is clumsier than usual, step up your game."
"In Cassie‚Äôs case though she was very very young and grooming is a factor. They knew each other when she was 19‚Ä¶ when she was 21 he bombarded her with all the affection and ‚Äútreated well¬†‚Äú. Months later the crazy happened. She didn‚Äôt really have a baseline of what relationships should and would be. Also it is not uncommon for women to protect their abuser too. There is more on a psychological level to this. Also there is still love there despite the craziness she went through.  Still to this day I have fear of my ex but if I was alone with him my brain goes in survival mode and would just comply. I left when he was passed out. And went to a shelter. I also had to cut out his family as they would just bring me back.  I was with my ex from the time I was 17-24 with 3 kids I‚Äôm 48 now.  Just want to give perspective. Also Cassie was subpoenaed by the government the government because they are trying to get Diddy on Rico charges, and if it wasn‚Äôt for that security guard, grabbing a screen video of what happened they would not have had the evidence of how violent he actually was."
"The problem is, sometimes the victim doesn't leave right away because they are in shock, and being mentally manipulated about the abuse.  Sometimes it takes a few months to get your bearings and process the events."
"I see a lot of disagreement with Bill on this one but he‚Äôs right. People have to start taking accountability. 
I was in abusive relationship where I thought I was in love with the person. I still left after the first noticeable realization that the person was abusing me with manipulation tactics before things got really bad. I was able to do so because I was always taught that I am the only one responsible for my actions. 
If everyone is treated as a victim for theirs actions they co-sign on, well, that‚Äôs what they are always going to be‚Ä¶ a victim"
"Yes Bill ,  every  situation is black and white. Thanks for your insight"
"To Bill and all the commenters agreeing with him:  it sounds like you should educate yourself on the dynamics behind abusive relationships.  How they happen, why the victim stays or seemingly puts up with it, etc.  In reading the comments for this video you might find a few answers. 

This isn't about modern women, talking about accountability for them, or anything like that.  

Abusers are a real problem in the world and what's very much needed is education on what an abusive relationship is, what abusers are and how they operate.  Finding oneself in an abusive relationship can happen to anyone and even with that knowledge it can be difficult to identify abusers until it's too late and you're no longer safe.  

And that doesn't even cover the pipeline phenomenon of children growing up in abusive homes or getting abused in other ways from non family members, who, find themselves in abusive romantic relationships because they're not educated about abuse and don't understand that without work and education, their past almost makes an abusive romantic relationship the default that they'll find themselves in.  

Unfortunately this is a more complicated and nuanced and sensitive subject that requires an informed, educated understanding of it in order to discuss it responsibly.

Just because Bill and people like you think it's a simple topic with a simple answer doesn't mean it is. 

If it were, abusive relationships wouldn't exist.  People wouldn't fall for them. People wouldn't find themselves in them. People wouldn't find themselves not knowing how the heck to get out without making things even worse, and risking death more than they already are. It's a catch 22 with abusers - stay, hoping he (or she) won't keel you, leave fearing he or she probably will definitely try to now."
"Oh poor Bill, never married or a father, giving women advice on how to leave an abusive relationship. Deluded, uninformed man. His ego has no bounds. üòÆ"
I love Bill. Agree with him on many issues. This is one he should have left alone. 1. He is a man. 2. He will never be a woman in an abusive relationship. I love how people like to make a problem black and white. The psychological manipulation that transpires in an abusive relationship is powerful. He obviously didn‚Äôt see the footage of Cassie being dragged down a hallway in a hotel and kicked. Diddy was a powerful man and he could convince a woman he would find her wherever she would hide. Please Bill stick with politics. You have no idea the experience of an abused woman so no clue how to stop it. It‚Äôs never just as simple as LEAVE or women would be doing that.
Bill has a point. With some of these cases it‚Äôs not even enough that the women agreed to situation or act. There has to be a level of personal responsibility.
Has anyone thought of telling men to not abuse women?
I have been an abusive relationship situation myself and I can assure you Bill you are talking out your arse.
Tina Turner suffered many year before she found the strength to leave ‚ù§ üí™üíØ
"Anyone who has seen the video of Cassie leaving Diddy, only to have to sh&t beat out of her for it by an elevator, knows you sometimes can‚Äôt ‚Äújust leave‚Äù. I usually love your show but this was monologue was beyond ignorant."
"Bro, no. You are so out of touch, it‚Äôs incredible. How dare you?! The Nerve show has you nailed the wall on this. I suggest you apologize, but you‚Äôre gonna have a real hard time digging yourself out of this PR hole. I‚Äôve lost all respect for you as a man."
Yes Bill and when women report it done by  powerful people they are often not belived
If only leaving really were that easy for so many women... some ignorance here.
"Sometimes, and I don't disagree with that you should walk away after abuse, but sometimes it takes a long time to realize the harm; you know, like smoking, drinking, and sugar."
I agree but let's not ignore the psychological dependency abusers create to keep their victims from leaving them.
"Cassie's texts - simple:  she was fawning. Playing along. Complying. Obeying. Being submissive. Doing and saying what she felt she had to at that point to keep the predator pacified and satisfied.  That's the game you find yourself playing in order to try to create and or maintain whatever it is that seems like relative safety / the possible best outcome of a dangerous situation at that point.

It's also interesting to know that apparently he had her drugged half the time. To help keep her from trying to walk away / keep her under his control.  

This whole thing is so sick and tragic."
"There's a thing called trauma bonding, it's a real thing Bill, look into it before you condem women for staying too long, or placating their abuser out of survival, when your life or your children's life is threatened, you will play the game as long as you can, including sexual games , you will do whatever they say, especially when you've lost all hope, have only fear, and can't see a way out, she did run from him and he ran after her and kick the shit out of her, so Billy boy, don't lecture what you know nothing about!!!!!!"
"Sorry Bill, but how dare you ask people to be accountable for their own bad choices? The children are victims, drugged women/men are victims, girlfriends are enablers."
"Please Bill wake completely up!,!!!"
"When he first started speaking, I wasn't sure I was going to like it.  But by the end, I thought Bill had a point.
What's truly depressing, reading the comment section, is the amount of people watching this channel who have Zero ability to hear and tolerate Nuance.  Like: ""How dare you suggest that some people have some responsibility in their own lives!""  It's Hard!  My mother was abused!  Anything that is true for one person is true for all!!!!!  (It's not.)  Take a breather people.  You are Exhausting."
This should be retitled ‚Äúbill mahar suggests women take an adult amount of accountability for their actions and feelings that are equal to that which they demand of everyone else‚Äù. I can‚Äôt believe they let him do this! This is the first time I‚Äôve ever heard somebody on the left actually call on women to take personally accountability. Can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôll go well.
I guess I'm the only one who doesn't care about Diddy or this trial?
We literally saw a video of her trying to leave a situation with him and watched him beat and kick and drag her back into that situation. Many people understood by watching that wasn't a 1st occasion or 1 off on his behavior towards her.
"Abuse isn‚Äôt the only reason a woman stays, you seem to be describing ""women"" as a type of woman without realizing this is the most sensitive subject, it involves women from all kinds, backgrounds, inmigration status even. This monologue is very dangerous, out of touch and uneducated. ""Some of that is on you""? This is said so lightly  it's heartbreaking media still do not understand domestic abuse is so complex. ""Go to police first"" I liked this part, but I think this type of statements could only be said directly to an specific case you know about very well Bill.. like a sister or a friend, but not model it for others as a type of speech to tell all victims of abuse because it can cause damage."
"And if you file a false claim, you need to go to prison."
"That‚Äôs over simplifying the issue. It‚Äôs much easier to walk away, if it‚Äôs the first or second date. Harder if the transition was insidious, after establishing a dependent relationship. 
Again, not that simple"
As a fan I was SO disappointed with this.. .Bill Maher understands NOTHING about domestic abuse...please educate yourself on the subject Bill before talking about it.
Bill's gunna get a lot of $hi+ for this lol
"I understand completely what Maher is saying and there are people who want to pick apart  his main point.  The main point is do not stay in an abusive relationship. I don't know why that seems to be a provocative statement. And for people saying, ""Tell people to not abuse."" Everyone knows are not supposed to abuse anyone, so trying to convince an abuser not to abuse is not going to help as they know exactly what they are doing and why.  But what you can do is tell people to worry about their own actions.  I can't control what anyone else does, I can only control my reaction to it. So if someone where to hit me or verbally abuse me, I am responsible for my next steps.

Men can be abused as well, but since Maher is discussing women, I'll follow his line.  Women are being coddled and told however they react in an abusive situation is valid and it is not. So many stay even when their family and friends are telling them not to and offering support.  These women need to really examine why they stay. It can't all boil down to men being Rasputin level master manipulators and ""love bombing"" them because that gives the notion that women are weak-minded and easily cowed.  As soon as the abuse start whether ten days into the relationship or 10 years into it; for that person's peace they should get out the relationship."
What would abused women do without this profound advise. Disgusting.üôÑ
Big facts üíØ
"maybe celebrity abuse is a different kind of animal when there is the allure of money and fame. for the everyday woman, the abuse on the mind can disable the courage and confidence needed to make the life altering decision of removing yourself (and your kids) from the threat, and then there is  the very real control of fear and shame when the abuser promises to hunt you down if you leave. Add on to that financial challenges and housing struggles if there is not a strong support of family and community, and the simplified advice of Just Leave sounds patronizing.  For the woman with an intact sense of self unscathed by trauma this is solid advice. For the broken, it is unhelpful. I think better advice is TELL SOMEONE you trust, because it is the secrecy that keeps the abused overpowered by shame and fear."
thank you comment section for restoring my faith in humanity. these disguisting men are exposing themselves by the minute these days
So wise and TRUE..love Bill Maher's take on almost every social issue. Its called WISDOM
"Please tell us more about your views on women, domestic violence, there‚Äôs a confusion debate on where you stand. We‚Äôd love to know more, we‚Äôre super excited about what you have next to say since you‚Äôre always so exciting!"
Emmanuel Macron is the president of France and he can‚Äôt get away from his allegedly abusive wife. How does Bill Maher expect a regular person to leave an abusive partner?
This needs to go viral great take
"4:52 Best bit of the show in years. Shut up the ""yeah!!"" guy."
The Nerve pegged you right!!!  What she said!!!!!!
"So many of these comments from victims complaining about how ""its not that easy"".  Bill ISNT saying its easy.  He's saying that victims need to USE the tools they have won over the last decade.  That isnt saying ""its easy""."
"Bill FYI it is very hard to get away from an abusive relationship...especially when the abuser is very powerful and can come after you, destroy or end your life. Tina Turner was abused for very long time( 20 years maybe?) before she could runaway from Ike pennyless"
The love of money will forever grant them access to said abusers.
Bill Maher- little man who couldn‚Äôt get a girl before he had fame: Shut up. You have no idea what it takes to ‚Äújust leave‚Äù. You‚Äôre not helping women or society. Why not ask the ABUSERS to get help ‚Äúafter the first time‚Äù?!
Great points
If your abuser is broke call the police if your abuser is rich call the lawyer
"I remember when I watched Bill Maher because you got to see an informed dialog between opposing viewpoints. Now he just trashes on the younger generation and anyone who opposes the ""Jen O'Side""(google blocks it every time I use the correct spelling, thanks algorithm) in Gaza. You lost me Bill."

Ich denke auch nicht, dass die H√ºrde nun unermesslich hoch ist sondern in eine richtigere Relation geschoben wird: Wenn keine sexuelle Bel√§stigung nach StGB vorliegt, liegt keine vor. Das sollte man bei jeder metoo-Debatte (die sicherlich ihre Berechtigungen haben k√∂nnen), bedenken."
"Wer profitiert?

Nachr√ºckerin Julia Schneider und Stefan Audretsch. 
Zu deren Rolle in der Gelbhaar Aff√§re w√§re ein Teil 2 sicher sehr interessant um den Vorgang in den Einzelheiten n√§her aufzuarbeiten."
"Interessante Reportage, die u.a. zeigt, wie durch die Auswahl von Interview-Teilen, das teilweise nachtr√§gliche Kommentieren von Aussagen usw. auf eine subtile Weise ein Eindruck hinterlassen wird, dass Hr. Gelbhaar ""im Grunde"" doch nicht unschuldig sei.
Interessant auch, dass sich in dieser Reportage wenig konkrete Belastungs-Indizien finden lassen. Soweit ich es entnehmen konnte, geht es um Ber√ºhrungen an Arm und Schulter und n√§chtliche Nachrichten (mit welchem Inhalt?).
Besonders schwierig ist f√ºr mich nachvollziehbar, wenn ein entscheidendes Kriterium ist, wie jemand etwas empfindet. Und das verbunden mit der Erwartung, dass der andere diese Empfindung sp√ºren muss und sich entsprechend vorausschauend zu verhalten hat.
Wohlgemerkt, ich kenne die Details im Verhalten von Hr. Gelbhaar nicht, kenne auch die entsprechenden gerichtlichen Beweisaufnahmen, Entscheidungen etc. nicht. Aber diese Dokumentation beleuchtet das in meinen Augen auch nicht klar. Deshalb sollten auch eine unterschwellig eingebaute Wortwahl oder gar ein S√§en von Zweifel unterbleiben.
Als Fazit bleibt f√ºr mich: In einem solchen Umfeld sollte man den Umgang nur auf das N√∂tigste beschr√§nken, keinerlei auch nur ansatzweise vertrauliche Verhaltensweisen anwenden etc. Dass unangemessenes Verhalten oder gar strafrechtlich relevante Verst√∂√üe v√∂llig unakzeptabel sind, und geahndet werden sollten, versteht sich von selbst."
Wie Demmert zu ihren Posten beim RBB gekommen ist auch fragw√ºrdig!!
"Er hatte ja zu mehreren Vorw√ºrfen Alibis pr√§sentiert. Nicht nur eine Anschuldigung also falsch. 
Wer hat die Intrige denn koordiniert? Falsche Beschuldigung muss hart bestraft werden und Schadenersatz und Verdienstausfall f√§llig werden.

Was wirft man nun vor? Flirt unter Kollegen und Ber√ºhrung am R√ºcken?"
Gelbhaar hat meine volle Solidarit√§t
"19:07 ""H√§rte"" ist relativ. Ich finde die Wortwahl ung√ºnstig, da man der Autorin unterstellen k√∂nnte, sie wolle Herrn Gelbhaar als skrupellosen, kalten Taktierer darstellen. Als Beschuldigter nutzt man halt alle juristischen Mittel, um sich zu wehren. Ob man dies dann ""hart"" findet, ist schlichtweg subjektiv."
Es haben nicht alle Verloren... Audretsch hat sein Mandat... Beim RBB hat keiner seinen Job verloren... Alle bekommen ihre hohen Geh√§lter weiter (da stellt sich wieder die Frage warum die √ñR so hohe Geh√§lter zahlen wenn nie jemand Verantwortung f√ºr irgendwas tragen muss) Der RBB bekommt weiter seine Rundfunkbeitr√§ge auch wenn er seinen Auftrag nicht erf√ºllt hat... Nur Gelbhaar muss die Konsequenzen tragen.
"Die letzten drei Sekunden zerst√∂ren den guten und ausgewogenen Bericht. ""Bei dem Fall haben alle Beteiligten verloren"". Nein, es haben nicht alle verloren. Das Mandat von Stefan Gelbhaar hat jetzt jemand Anderes eingenommen. Dieser Aspekt wurde √ºberhaupt nicht beleuchtet."
"Das Postulat, dass die Unschuldsvermutung in solchen F√§llen nicht gelten soll, wird hier letztlich bekr√§ftigt. Es widerspricht aber den Grundfesten des Rechts."
"Es ist ersch√ºtternd, wie in dieser Doku die nachweislich falsche eidesstattliche Erkl√§rung ‚Äì die von einer nicht existierenden Person stammt ‚Äì zwar erw√§hnt, aber dann fast beil√§ufig abgehandelt wird. Das war der schwerste Vorwurf, der sich als komplett haltlos herausgestellt hat. Statt diese offensichtliche Intrige weiter aufzukl√§ren ‚Äì inklusive der Frage, wer davon profitiert hat ‚Äì richtet sich der Fokus pl√∂tzlich wieder auf andere, gleichzeitig eingegangene Vorw√ºrfe, als k√∂nnten diese v√∂llig unabh√§ngig davon doch irgendwie glaubw√ºrdig sein. Dass Gelbhaar sich juristisch gegen diese koordinierte Kampagne gewehrt hat, wird ihm nun auch noch als √ºberzogene Reaktion ausgelegt. Diese Umkehr der Perspektive ‚Äì weg vom eigentlichen Skandal hin zu einer impliziten T√§ter-Opfer-Umkehr ‚Äì ist journalistisch fragw√ºrdig und inhaltlich absurd."
"Die vorw√ºrfe die noch im Raum stehen h√∂ren sich l√§cherlich an, wenn man den Vergleich zu anderen MeToo Opfern zieht. Ber√ºhrungen an Arm und Schulter sowie ‚Äûn√§chtliche‚Äú Chats sind kein Grund eine politische Karriere zu zerst√∂ren, egal ob sie stimmen oder nicht."
Ihr habt alle mitgehetztü§Æü§Æü§Æ
"Wenn alles ""Gef√ºhl"" ist, dann gibt es auch keine Rechtssicherheit und damit auch keinen Schutz des Individuums mehr ... Nur weil jemand das Wort ""√ºbergriffig"" in den Mund nimmt, darf noch keinerlei Rufsch√§digung ins Werk gesetzt werden ..."
" Mir tut der Herr Gelbhaar leid: Erst kostet ihn die vermutlich ideologiegesteuerte √ñRR-Berichterstattung seine Karriere, dann setzt der n√§chste √ñRR-Sender noch einen drauf, indem er fragt, ob er nicht doch ein schlimmer Finger sei, da er doch eine Frau am Arm ber√ºhrt haben soll! Mo bleibt der Ma√üstab, wo die Ernsthaftigkeit?"
Schwierig wenn alles so schwammig gehalten wird. Es wird nicht einmal irgendwas konkretes genannt & immer nur drumherumgeredet.
Wann kommt der 2.Teil zu Strippenziehern und Nutznie√üern der Intrige?
"Ich liebe Zapp. Ihr habt unglaublich differenzierte Berichte, die sonst nur schwer zu finden sind. Die Fragen der Reporter:innen sind super, und sie machen immer einen tollen Job.

Hier hat mich aber gest√∂rt, dass die Spiegel-Reporterin als ‚ÄûExpertin‚Äú befragt wurde. Nur weil man √ºber ein Thema schreibt, ist man nicht automatisch eine Expertin. Gerade bei so polarisierenden Themen braucht es mehr als nur viel Wissen, um als Expertin zu gelten. Meines Erachtens ist die Reporterin voreingenommen; ‚ÄûExpertin‚Äú suggeriert (zumindest f√ºr mich), dass sie so neutral wie m√∂glich ist.

Au√üerdem st√∂rt mich, dass nach dem Einspielen des Lage-der-Nation-Podcasts suggeriert wird, dies sei Teil jener Berichterstattung, die Gelbhaar ausschlie√ülich als Opfer sieht. Dabei wurde im Podcast durchaus angesprochen, dass weiterhin Vorw√ºrfe im Raum stehen. Faktisch gibt es erfundene Vorw√ºrfe ‚Äì und unabh√§ngig von der Causa Gelbhaar stellt sich abstrakt die Frage, inwiefern MeToo nicht nur juristisch oder durch Ombudsstellen akribisch und ernsthaft aufgearbeitet wird, sondern auch in der √∂ffentlichen Wahrnehmung vorschnell verurteilt.

Die Opfer m√ºssen ernst genommen werden ‚Äì und trotzdem sind sowohl die Ombudsstellen als auch die Medien offensichtlich zu schlecht darin, ihre eigenen Vorurteile kritisch zu hinterfragen."
"Und hier stelle ich einmal fest: zu behaupten man wurde sexuell bel√§stigt oder misshandelt, wenn es nicht stimmt, ist genau so schlimm als h√§tte man so etwas getan!"
"Der gr√∂√üte Witz.  F√ºr 60.000 Euro Zwangsgeb√ºhren wurden externe Berater beauftragt,  die den Profis vom rbb die M√§ngel in ihren Gesch√§fzsprozessen aufschreiben sollen."
"Stefan Gelbhaar h√§tte sich nicht zur√ºckziehen sollen, weil er doch genau wusste, dass nichts an den Vorw√ºrfen dran war. Letztendlich ging es nach meiner Wahrnehmung nur darum, ihn aus dem Weg zu schaffen, damit die Nachr√ºcker profitieren. Das hat ja geklappt."
"Zu 19:36
Warum kann die Zapp-Journalistin die Frage, wann der Fall f√ºr sie gekl√§rt ist, nicht konkret beantworten? ""Wenn man verstanden hat, was vorgefallen ist"" ist unkonkret und nebul√∂s. Wer ist ""man"" in diesem Fall, wessen Verst√§ndnis soll hier ausschlaggebend sein?

Bislang ist in der Sache nur im vorl√§ugigen Rechtsschutz entschieden worden. Eine konkrete Antwort w√§re zum Beispiel gewesen, dass die Sache nach einer Hauptsache-Entscheidung als gekl√§rt zu betrachten ist. Darauf will sich die Journalistin aber anscheinend nicht festlegen. Warum nicht?

Durch die unkonkrete Beantwortung der Frage entsteht der Eindruck, dass hier ein sog. ""goalpost moving"" vorbereitet werden soll. In dem man sich nicht auf konkrete Kriterien festlegt, kann man sich immer neue Vorraussetzungen ausdenken, die erf√ºllt sein m√ºssen, damit die Sache als gekl√§rt betrachtet werden kann. Das ist eine offensichtlich unfaire Strategie, welche mit Qualit√§tsjournalismus nichts zu tun hat."
Ich habe die Gr√ºndung der Me Too Bewegung seinerzeit sehr begr√º√üt und unterst√ºtzt! Mit der Zeit wurde mir die 'Bewegung aber immer suspekter! Und zutiefst zuwider!
"Wow - der einzige ""Beleg"", den die Autorin gegen S. Gelbhaar konrekt anspricht, ist eine Dame, der gerichtlich verboten wurde, wahrheitswidrige Beschuldigungen gegen S.Gelbhaar weiter zu verbreiten.

Was f√ºr eine Rechercheleistung!"
Solche Journalisten m√ºssen sofort entlassen werden
"Das muss dieser Qualit√§ts Journalismus sein, von dem der √ñRR immer spricht und damit die Beitr√§ge rechtfertigt"
"das Erbauliche daran ist, wie der Beitrag auch inhaltlich und formell best√§tigt, dass Schuld eine Frage des Charakters und nicht des Geschlechts ist. Besonders tragisch dabei, dass dieser Grundsatz in Verbindung mit einer Partei, offenbar missachtet wurde, die sich eigentlich gegen JEDE Form der Diskriminierung aufgrund von Herkunft und Geschlecht einsetzt."
"Als ob man Fr√∂schen den Auftrag geben w√ºrde, eine Studie zur Trockenlegung des T√ºmpels zu erstellen.........."
"Dass es unter Metoo h√§ufig zu Kollateralsch√§den kam wo jemandes leben zerst√∂rt wurde, der unschuldig war, ist vielen egal."
"Warum wird hier verschwiegen, wer vom ""Abschuss"" Gelbhaar profitiert hat?"
Das in Deutschland der tolle Journalismus RBB dich machen
Audretsch wollte seinen Konkurrenten los werden f√ºr den Bundestagsplatz.
Ist ja der RBB fein raus. Mach den laden endlich dicht.
"Zum Thema ""√ºbersehene Perspektiven"": Im Beitrag kommen vier Journalistinnen und nur ein Journalist zu Wort: Christian Latz, Ann Katrin M√ºller, Lena Kampf, Ulrike Demmer, eine nicht genannte Frau ab 19:35. Die Frauen bestehen allesamt darauf, dass es sich um einen Fall von MeToo handele und gehen Gelbhaar in geradezu Inquisitorischer Weise an. Herr Latz schildert lediglich kurz, wie er die konstruierten Vorw√ºrfe gegen Gelbhaar aufgedeckt hat. Der ganze Beitrag ist im Ergebnis dezidiert tendenzi√∂s und setzt das Narrativ vom m√§chtigen sexuellen Bel√§stiger Gelbhaar fort. Ein entsetzliches Beispiel f√ºr den ""Haltungsjournalismus""."
"Gab es wenigstens eine strafrechtliche Verfolgung der ersten Dame, die alles erfunden hatte? Irgendwie werden solche unwichtigen Details immer bei diesen Berichten vergessen."
"Wie sollen sich denn Menschen, noch finden, wenn sie nicht mehr flirten d√ºrfen? Soll das nur noch √ºber die App laufen?"
"19:10 Es ist schon irgendwo ironisch, dass in einem Bericht, in dem es um Vorverurteilungen geht, so eine Frage gestellt wird. Er wehrt sich dagegen Punkt. Wenn er unschuldig ist, ist das nicht √ºberraschend, wenn er schuldig ist aber auch nicht. Das einzige, was mit dieser Frage erreicht wird ist Framing. Interessanter w√§re gewesen, was gefragt wurde, als er das Interview abgebrochen hat. Dass er das macht, anstatt alles f√ºr haltlos zu erkl√§ren, ist auch interessant. Das wird aber leider nicht gezeigt."
"Dass sich Intendantin Demmer ernsthaft in Respektsbekundungen ergeht, anstatt die R√ºcktritte von Chefredakteur und Programmdirektorin als eine Selbstverst√§ndlichkeit zu bezeichnen, erkl√§rt, weshalb die Zahl jener stetig steigt, die den √ñRR f√ºr unreformierbar halten."
"Besch√§mend, verlogen etc.üëéüëéüëé"
"Dass am Ende des Beitrags auf die ""Opfer sexueller Gewalt"" verwiesen wird, obwohl die verbliebenen Vorw√ºrfe gegen Gelbhaar damit nichts zu tun haben, ist erschreckend. Was soll dieses Framing?"
"Das mit dem Machtverh√§ltnis halte ich f√ºr sehr schwierig. Wollen wir nur noch Partnerschaften zwischen wirtschaftlich gleich gestellten Personen erlauben?
Viele junge Frauen sind mit √§lteren gut verdienenden M√§nnern zusammen. Was machen wir daraus?
Die alten M√§nner daf√ºr verurteilen, dass sie auf junge Frauen zugehen, oder die Frauen daf√ºr verurteilen, dass sie bei der Partnersuche anscheinend auf das Geld achten?"
kennt man von Kachelmann ...nichts neues
"Der vorletzte Satz ist aber auch nicht ganz richtig. Es gibt immer wieder gro√üe und auch viele kleine Anschuldigungen die falsch sind und wo es gl√ºcklicherweise auch raus kommt.
Das ist aber wichtig um zu wissen, dass es sowas eben auch gibt. Es ist nicht die Regel und die meisten Opfer sind auch Opfer, aber eben nicht alle. Das muss man dabei immer f√ºr beide Seiten im Hinterkopf haben.
Und wie hier eben auch, nur weil eine Person l√ºgt, hei√üt das nicht, dass die andere Person fehlerfrei ist.
Man muss immer hinterfragen und, aus gutem Grund, journalistische Standards einhalten. Der allerletzte Satz trifft es da dann doch gut, denn hier haben zumindest wirklich alle Beteiligten verloren, der Journalismus, Herr Gelbhaar, die Person die ihn falsch verd√§chtigt hat und alle Leute die sich wirklich bel√§stigt gef√ºhlt haben."
25:52 Zapp hat die Relativierung nicht nur gefressen sondern als Fazit eingeschnitten.
Das dumme Gegender ist nervig
Das erste Drittel hatte offensichtlich nur einen Alibi-Zweck.
Alleine die gestelzt genderneutrale Sprache wirkt sehr gek√ºnstelt. Insgesamt geht es offenbar weniger um kritischen Journalismus als um ein moralisches Statement
"Ist ein ""Qualit√§tsmedium"" das sich nicht an Standards h√§lt denn wirklich ein Qualit√§tsmedium?"
"""... Sie waren √ºberfordert damit, wie sagt man einem Bundestagsabgeordneten, das man einen Kontakt haben m√∂chte, aber anders?"" Und das ist dann das Problem des Bundestagsabgeordneten? Dann muss die Person sich halt Rat holen, aber nicht Dinge kritisieren, welche man einfach abstellen kann, nur diese Person halt nicht. Wenn mein Gegen√ºber mir nicht mitteilt, dass etwas f√ºr Sie/Ihn nicht in Ordnung ist, dann ist das nicht mein Problem."
"Wenn der RBB scheinbar so ein Saftladen ist, wie viel Saftladen sind dann die anderen Sparten? ü§∑"

"Andere fertigzumachen , zu ruinieren und dann unterzutauchen verdient √ºberhaupt keinen Respekt!!!!! Die sollen aus der Deckung kommen und sich √∂ffentlich entschuldigen und vor Gericht angeklagt werden."
Mit diesem Bericht ist der NDR seinem Ruf absolut gerecht geworden.
"Das wird das wohl beste Spiel des Herrn Audretsch gewesen sein. 
Da kann man nur den Hut ziehen.
Bez√ºglich Herrn Gelbhaar tuts mir leid. Seine Position war einfach zu begehrt. Zur falschen Zeit auf dem falschen Listenplatz."
"Welche l√§cherlichen Argumente ... er habe sie bei einem Gespr√§ch mal am Arm, mal am R√ºcken BER√úHRT ..."
Trozdem ist diese doku immernoch als vorwurf gegen ihn formuliert .... Anscheinend lernt man nicht aus den fehlern .....
"14:40 Mal eine Frage, w√ºrde diese Journalistin auch sagen, dass man ""MeToo"" auch dazu benutzen wollte um Gelbhaar zu schaden. Dass sich zumindest die Journalisten des RBB, sp√§testens als man sich entschied die Alibis von Gelbhaar g√§nzlich zu ignorieren, dar√ºber bewusst waren welchen Zweck diese Vorw√ºrfe offensichtlich hatten?"
"@ZAPP  Was ist denn in Minute 18:30 die ""vermeintliche Einladung in eine private Wohnung""? Eine vermeintliche Einlandung, ist doch gesichert keine Einladung! Ein vermeintlicher Dieb ist kein Dieb, sondern jemand der f√§lschlich f√ºr einen Dieb gehalten wurde. Was ist denn hier mit VERMEINTLICH gemeint?
 
Das ist doch ein Vorwurf, der offensichtlich gar kein Vorwurf war, sondern nur f√ºr einen Vorwurf gehalten wurde, oder? Sonst w√§rs ja keine vermeintliche Einladung, sondern eine Einladung!"

1:39 Da sitzt der gro√üe Nutznie√üer. Zwischen Spitzenkandidatin und damals noch Ministerin Paus und Helga Feddersen.
"Es w√§re gut klarzustellen das ""eidestattliche Versicherungen"" gegen√ºber Medien genau nichts Wert sind. Es hat keine Konsequenzen wenn diese falsch sind. Es ist genau definiert welche Beh√∂rden eine solche Versicherung abnehmen k√∂nnen..."
"W√§re dieser Beitrag ein Schulaufsatz, w√ºrde der Lehrer ""Thema verfehlt"" drunter schreiben.
Hier geht es um eine politische Intrige. Solche gab es in der Politik leider schon immer, um parteiinterne Konkurrenten aus dem Weg zu r√§umen, damit f√ºr einen selbst der Weg auf den ersehnten Posten frei wird. Dabei ist der Grund der Anschuldigung zweitrangig und wechselt mit der Zeit ( noch in den 80ern war beispielsweise der Vorwurf der Homosexualit√§t ein Totschlagargument). Die eigentliche Frage ist aber ""Wem nutzt es ? "". Also wer hat von dieser Intrige profitiert und wer hat sie insziniert. Und nat√ºrlich die Motive der Helfershelfer beim RBB. Waren sie wirklich so naiv oder schlichtweg Komplizen der Intrige ?
Keine dieser Fragen wird beantwortet oder auch nur gestellt. Stattdessen Me too Gelaber und die Unterstellung, es k√∂nne vielleicht doch etwas dran sein an den Vorw√ºrfen der sexuellen Bel√§stigung."
"Noch eine Anmerkung zu Min 19:26: Scheinbar ist der Redakteurin der Ablauf im Eilverfahren nicht bekannt. Seit 2020 muss in solchen F√§llen immer die Gegenseite angeh√∂rt werden, was hier auch tats√§chlich passiert ist. Klara Sch√§dlich hat ihre Argumente vorgebracht und trotzdem hat das Gericht so entschieden. Hat Gelbhaar das nicht gesagt? Haben Sie das rausgeschnitten?"
"Alte Weisheit ""gib einem Ferkel einen Posten, schon wird es zur Sau""  trifft leider quer Beet zuüòï"
"So sieht Journalismus in Deutschland aus üòÇüòÇüòÇ

12:14 ich w√ºrde die Details gerne alle erfahren und finde das Ausweichen hier nicht in Ordnung.
"Zum Ende. Ich finde man h√§tte den Schaden f√ºr die ""Metoo-Bewegung"" reduzieren k√∂nnen, wenn sobald sich herausgestellt hat, dass hier falsche Vorw√ºrfe verbreitet wurden, den Mann sofort rehabilitiert h√§tte und die Frauen bestraft. So ist es keine gesellschaftlich anschlussf√§hige Bewegung, da jeder Mann durch falsche Beschuldigungen zerst√∂rt werden kann und die Anschuldigungen bereits das Urteil sind.
Die logische Schlussfolgerung f√ºr M√§nner ist die Bewegung zu bek√§mpfen."
"nein es haben nicht alle verloren, es ist ein Lehrst√ºck und wer das nicht erkennt ist der Verlierer. Das Schlusszitat ist √§rgerlich und zeigt das die Redaktion ihre Lektion nicht gelernt hat."
1:42 Warum sind hier die Autoren verpixelt?
" 1:03 Wieso ist seine Rolle nicht eindeutig? Was haben die Vorw√ºrfe anderer Frauen mit der Intrige zu tun, die ihn die Karriere gekostet hat?"
tl;dr: der Gr√ºnen-Ideologiepartei gehts um Macht. Wundert das irgendwen? Mich nicht. Gute Nacht!
"Irgendwie wird man in dieser Diskussion als junge Frau zum unm√ºndigen Kind gemacht. Wenn Gelbhaar daf√ºr gesch√§tzt wurde, auf Augenh√∂he zu kommunizieren, dann kann man doch erstmal davon ausgehen, dass er eine Grenzziehung auf Augenh√∂he nicht mit einer Machtdemonstration beantworten w√ºrde."
"Ich find, was der TSP Reporter gesagt hat wichtig , dass die relation wichtig ist.Und ja am ende gibt es keine Gewinner - was auch traurig ist"
Wer hat denn den gr√∂√üten Profit aus dem R√ºcktritt Hr. Gelbhaars erwirtschaftet?
Minute 10:44 : Der gute Ruf des RBB :))) ich brech ab... das meinen die noch ernst
Unglaublich was hier angerichtet wurde und welche Debatten man heute √ºber solche F√§lle f√ºhrt.
Euer gendern macht den ganzen Bericht kaputt
"Der beste Beweis, als Mann bist du in solchen F√§llen schuldig bis du freigesprochen wirst. Und selbst dann bist du ja eigentlich doch schuldig."
"""Die Frauen haben sich bedr√§ngt gef√ºhlt."" Keine Ahnung, was da passiert ist, aber es ist ein Unterschied, ob man jmd. bedr√§ngt oder ob sich derjenige bedr√§ngt f√ºhlt. Ich f√ºhle mich auch manchmal im Job bedr√§ngt, wenn Frauen z.B. oben rum sehr wenig bekleidet sind aber deswegen wurde ich nach allgemeinem Verst√§ndnis doch nicht bel√§stigt? 

Der Umgang der Gr√ºnen mit diesem Fall, besonders die Gr√ºnen aus Berlin ist bezeichnend f√ºr den Zustand dieser Partei. Viele der Menschen, die dort arbeiten, propagieren Werte, die sie selbst nicht leben."

"Uma verdadeira jornalista, n√£o passa pano e n√£o acusa sem prova concreta. Adriana Negreiros"
Resumo da √≥pera: a inten√ß√£o era s√≥ DERRUBAR o Silvio Almeida!
"Se o inqu√©rito foi aberto por conta da denuncia do Me Too e este n√£o tem dados concretos, ent√£o o inqu√©rito foi feito sem os dados das vitimas? Ainda bem que existem jornalistas das antigas. Talvez estejamos testemunhando uma den√∫ncia por encomenda."

Caraca! Pode ter sido cometida uma grande injusti√ßa com o Silvio Almeida. Caraca!
"7:21 sim Fab√≠ola, o ministro √© inocente at√© que ele seja condenado. Como qualquer pessoa no nosso pa√≠s"
Esse caso precisa ser esclarecido. Pra que n√£o haja injusti√ßa de nenhum lado.
"N√£o existe aula de √âtica na faculdade de jornalismo? Jornalistas nunca ouviram falar do caso Escola Base? A imprensa est√° lucrando muito com isso. Antes mesmo do julgamento oficial, do Poder Judici√°rio, a m√≠dia j√° destruiu a reputa√ß√£o de uma pessoa."

"Como assim, ""isso n√£o quer dizer que ele √© inocente""? Se ele n√£o foi condenado, √© legalmente inocente! Pode ser suspeito, mas culpado, ainda n√£o √©."
"Adriana Negreiros vem dando uma aula de bom Jornalismo, sempre respeitando as Partes envolvidas, bem assim nos Princ√≠pios Constitucionais da Ampla Defesa, do Contradit√≥rio e da Presun√ß√£o de Inoc√™ncia, diferentemente do Senhor Josias e a Senhora Cris que, diuturnamente, insistem em condenar antecipadamente.

Excelente Adriana fazer esse trabalho.Perfeito.Parabens.
"Significa que ele √© inocente at√© que se prove o contr√°rio, Fab√≠ola."

Inten√ß√£o era derrubar o ministro.
"A Fabiola cometeu um erro de comunica√ß√£o. Ela erra quando fala ""nao quer dizer que ele seja inocente"". Quando o mais coerente, nesse caso, seria dizer ""nao quer dizer que ele seja CULPADO"". Haja vista a presun√ß√£o de inoc√™ncia at√© os fatos julgados."
se n√£o apresentou as provas √© porque n√£o existem!
"Enquanto n√£o tiverem provas, S√≠lvio Almeida √© inocente. Como tb o prof. Alysson Mascaro."
Adriana ensinando a Fab√≠ola a n√£o seguir o m√©todo Lava-jato!
"Fab√≠ola, enquanto n√£o for julgado, ele √© inocente!"
Se teve as denuncias feita pra esta ONG tinha que ter registros e relatorios na data da denuncia feita
"Uma vez perguntei pra diretora do Me Too se ela conhecia o trabalho do Mascaro (o maior intelectual brasileiro marxista do pensamento cr√≠tico do direito) e ela disse que o achava ""superficial"" foi a√≠ que eu percebi a desonestidade intelectual dela
agora compara o lattes do Mascaro e o dela, vcs v√£o ver do que falo.
Vejo que uma ala da esquerda quer entrar no Coliseu sem ao menos saber da luta. 
Boa sorte a Ong americana Me Too e a todos os jornalistas liberais."
"QUERO SABER SE A FABIOLA, JOSIAS E SUA TRUPE V√ÉO PEDIDR DESCULPAS AO SILVIO ALMEIDA CASO ELE SEJA INOCENTADO."
Fazeram uma tremenda sacanagem com o ex-ministro Silvio Almeida.
Agora qual a consequ√™ncia para a elas?!! Acabaram com a vida do cara
"Da imprensa de direita, claro, n√£o me surpreendi pelas acusa√ß√µes. Mas vi uma grande e imatura ansiedade da imprensa de esquerda e das que fingem neutralidade por acusar S√≠lvio Almeida, como se fosse uma defesa pr√©via do pr√≥prio trabalho de imprensa dizendo ""a gente n√£o tolera isso de ningu√©m, n√£o √© porque √© de algu√©m de esquerda que vamos passar pano"".
Mas, ao tempo que qualquer desrespeito ou outra forma de agress√£o contra as mulheres √© intoler√°vel, seria toler√°vel prejudicar a vida de outra pessoa? Quantos preju√≠zos podem vir desse tipo de acusa√ß√£o? Profissional, familiar, amizades...
Claro que existe ass√©dio, mas tamb√©m existe cal√∫nia. E agora?
O fato de ser um crime que existe ""aos montes"", covarde porque raramente a v√≠tima tem como provar, n√£o justifica prejudicar a vida do acusado. Que arrumem uma solu√ß√£o sem esse risco, n√£o me perguntem como, n√£o sou jurista nem investigador.
Com tudo isso, n√£o me sinto seguro em defender S√≠lvio Almeida, mas tamb√©m n√£o acuso, e, ""in dubio pro reo""."
"como foi dito no final, a credibilidade desse tipo de den√∫ncia, especialmente contra pessoas p√∫blicas, vai ruindo com acelera√ß√£o exponencial."
"Primeiro demite o cara, difama o cara e superempodera a mulher...depois apura..."
"A abordagem: Voc√™ foi abusada pelo Silvio Almeida?

Muito s√©rio e confi√°vel."
"Fica tranquilo, UOL, ele deve ser culpado! Porque segundo a l√≥gica do Josias de Souza (O Especialista em tudo do canal) se o Silvio Almeida n√£o sabe pq algu√©m mentiria, o Silvio deve ser culpado..."
Tentaram destruir o cara e a verdade veio a tona.
Se essa denuncia for falsa vai queimar tanto as pautas sobre ass√©dio!
"Parab√©ns a esta jornalista!
O que precisa ser investigada agora √© esta ONG."
Tinha que ter vindo do Guilherme Amado.
"""Precisamos encorpar a den√∫ncia "". O que √© isso? Diante disso, qual a veracidade, a confiabilidade dessa ong?"
"A inquisidora Fabiola Cidral ERROU e condenou ao dizer que Silvio Almeida nao e' inocente. Todo acusado e' e inocente e CONTINUA inocente ate' ser provada a culpa. Ate' la', e' inocente sim."
Muito competente a Adriana
"Madeleine, o fato de mulheres sofrerem abusos n√£o quer dizer que toda denuncia seja verdadeira. Enquanto n√£o se apresentar fatos que corrobore a denuncia, ele √© inocente! Que pressa √© essa em querer condenar sem provas?"
As mulheres no BR s√£o livres para denunciar em qualquer delegacia n√£o precisam de ONG mee too...estranho esse caso..
Sabe o que est√° me parecendo isso tudo? Lawfare.
"Quando este caso veio a p√∫blico foi um choque tao grande para mim, que at√© hoje n√£o me recuperei."
UMA VERGONHA. IDENTIT√ÅRIOS ATACANDO IDENTITARIOS. PURO OPORTUNISMO.
"Est√° passando da hora de se criar uma lei pesada contra falsas denuncias de ass√©dio e extupro.
Na verdade denuncias falsas do tipo deveriam ser tipificadas como crime hediondo."
"'In d√∫bio pro r√©u', outro famoso instituto jur√≠dico..."
Estar √† frente de uma Ong parece trazer poder e dinheiro.
"Essa hist√≥ria √© um esc√¢ndalo absurdo!
Destrui√ß√£o pr√©via de um homem que tem carreira s√©ria. 
Essa hist√≥ria t√° muito mal comtada."
"Ou seja, acabaram com a vida do cara sem prova alguma. √â f0d4, viu"
Aniele Franco j√° demonstrou ser uma pessoa pouco confi√°vel e pouco competente. Mas s√≥ o tempo dir√° quem mentiu.
Injusti√ßa....
"Enquanto a Madalena n√£o condenar o Silvio ela n√£o sossega!!!  Sou mulher,  mas √© deprimente certas atitudes feministas!!!!"
"N√£o se acusa algu√©m sem PROVAS, e √© isto que apg fez"
"Independente do espectro pol√≠tico do Ministro , falsa acusa√ß√£o √© algo muito s√©rio , 
Se  essas den√∫ncias s√£o falsas, al√©m do crime contra a honra do ministro, de terem prejudicado sua carreira e vida. familiar, temos um s√©rio problema n√£o s√≥ sobre o Me too mas tamb√©m sobre a Ministra Anielle .
Sim tudo isso deve - ser muito bem investigado, a grosso modo  do jeito que as coisas est√£o as motiva√ß√µes destas den√∫ncias me parecem ser uma baita rasteira pol√≠tica."
e por que a PF n√£o ouve as v√≠timas??????
"H√° criminosos sexuais, bem como h√° falsas acusa√ß√µes. A fala da Madeleine √© absurda! O fato de haver abusadores n√£o torna toda denuncia verdadeira. A falsa acusa√ß√£o tornou-se um modo barato, seguro e eficiente de vingan√ßa. √â barato porque bastam palavras; √© seguro, pois o agressor √© tratado como v√≠tima; √© eficiente, pois o acusado sofre danos de todos os tipos desde o momento da falsa den√∫ncia."
Quais os jornalistas e rep√≥rteres que far√£o o mea- culpa e se desculparem em p√∫blico para o ministro Silvio Almeida?   E a esposa dele? O casamento?  ü§¶ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"Dizer que ""isso n√£o significa que ele √© inocente"" √© muito grave. No Brasil o que h√° √© presun√ß√£o de inoc√™ncia. Infelizmente populismo penal tamb√©m faz parte do campo progressista."
At√© que enfim uma jornalista fazendo jornalismo! E ainda puxou a orelha da colega de bancada com essa narrativa que mais confunde do que informa o telespectador‚Ä¶ üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Silvio Almeida foi condenado sumariamente.
"Depois de ter condenado o sujeito, sem nenhuma prova, Fab√≠ola ainda diz que isso n√£o quer dizer que ele seja inocente. N√£o era melhor falar que foi irrespons√°vel? Isso serve para o Josias tamb√©m."
"Impressionante a fala da rep√≥rter: ""Isso n√£o quer dizer que ele √© inocente"".
At√© eu na minha ignor√¢ncia, j√° ouvi falar em algum lugar que at√© que se prove a culpa, √© presumida a inoc√™ncia e que cabe a quem acusa, o √¥nus da prova. 
Espero de verdade que isso seja esclarecido e se provado a culpa, que o mesmo seja punido exemplarmente. 
Mas caso contr√°rio, se nada for provado, que a puni√ß√£o alcance a todos os envolvidos, inclusive os que propagaram a mentira na m√≠dia."
Dependendo da imprensa o povo condena antes do julgamento na justi√ßa

"Il y a une question qui me tracasse. Est-ce que le mouvement Me Too arrivera √† changer le regard sur le corps de la femme qui la r√©duit √† une marchandise exploit√©e par plusieurs arts visuels (revues, clips musicaux, t√©l√©vision, cin√©ma‚Ä¶). C‚Äôest une marchandisation qui rapporte beaucoup d‚Äôargent et il faut dire que beaucoup de femmes sont elles-m√™mes promotrices souvent inconscientes de ce syst√®me qui leur permet de conna√Ætre parfois succ√®s et richesse. Est-ce que le v√©ritable aboutissement du Me Too ne passe pas aussi par une d√©marche de courage des femmes pour d√©sormais refuser de fonder leur succ√®s et leur richesse sur cette marchandisation? Car ceux qui sont au sommet de ce syst√®me auront toujours tendance √† consid√©rer qu‚Äôils ont des droits sur les ¬´¬†biens¬†¬ª qu‚Äôils ach√®tent. Je pose les questions. Je ne pr√©tends pas avoir les bonnes r√©ponses."

Les violences sont l√†, pr√™tes √† germer, car le pouvoir n‚Äôa pas de contradicteur , lorsqu‚Äôil y en a un, il est √©vinc√©. Quant √† la l√©gislation sur le travail, r√©gie, d√©coration, production regorgent d‚Äôill√©galit√©s au code du travail.

"I can remember fearing false accusation at work or school, or just absurdly hypersensensitive reframing, in the mid 90s. I think metoo was just a subsequent generation's feels-terrorism. Metoo was excellent, though, if you wanted to see the wolf crying on max volume."

"Truthfully, after that case, I'm wondering if Cassie was the one who introduced Sean Combs to ""Freak Offs?"" IMO, we've got to return to the days when women were forces to take responsibility for their behavior.  The MeToo Movement has ruined that."
"April you are so interesting to listen to and never seem to fail to see straight to the core of a matter, it's so necessary in these times but I would like to tell you it's so refreshing to see the ways In which you adorn yourself, it's beautiful bringing honor to yourself as well as your husband and family. It has become common to do the opposite today when too many are degrading themselves by their abuse of cosmetics and other trends seemingly totally unaware. It has not always been this way and it's so sad."
From the beginning of this fiasco I had my doubts that Cassie was a victim. Things just don't add up that she is a victim üòÆ.
"It depends on which one you‚Äôre referring too. The one that was created to support black eomen who experienced sexual assault, or the Hollywood one meant to silence black women?"

"You have to understand that most of the singers pushed to the forefront today are glorified backup dancers or background singers with good production. Cassie isnt even that. Shes a model who DOES ""singing"". Not a singer. She understood this and made the necessary moves to still make millions. Same as the rappers who needed to be put over. They may have more music talent, but the entertainment industry is all about the gatekeepers putting you on or getting down with a clique."

f/licitation pour votre prise de recul
Le gros souci c'est que ces violences sont l√©gitim√©es par les textes islamiques. Creusez de ce c√¥t√© !
Cela existe depuis longtemps....notamment dans ce qu'on appel les √©coles coranique.
"Le f√©minisme est incompatible avec l'islam 
Je ne parle pas de certains Haddith qui sont juste horrible √† lire, parce qu'ils divisent au sein des diff√©rentes communaut√©s 
Parlons du Saint Coran, lisez toutes les sourates du chapitre sur les femmes, c'est magnifique √† lire
Le Coran est accessible gratuitement sur le net, en quelques clics vous pouvez lire quelques sourates"
"Se sont des hommes qui sont jug√©s,pourquoi ajouter une dimension religieuse,c'est un probl√®me qui concerne tous le monde,vous associ√© encore l'islam dans un probl√®me de soci√©t√©."
"Mais mdr ces gens l√† ne repr√©sentent aucunement l‚Äôislam. 
Ils utilisent peut-√™tre hypocritement l‚Äôislam pour arriver √† leur fin mais ce genre de comportement n‚Äôe iste pas seulement dans les religions mais dans tout les secteurs d‚Äôactivit√©s (acteur, actrice, monde professionnel etc.)."
"Pour avoir suivi l'affaire de pr√®s √† l'√©poque je peux vous dire que √ßa n'a ni queue ni t√™te et honn√™tement m√™me si cela √©tait vrai on peut pas du tout qualifier les faits de VSS. De plus le personnage de Amin qui est un tr√®s jeune influenceur sur un sujet qu'il ne maitrise pas (l'islam) n'est pas tr√®s fiable. Il s'est beaucoup contredit et on sent que c'est une personne qui est en qu√™te de gloire √† travers le contenu qu'il a partag√© sur tiktok.
J'avoue √™tre un peu d√©√ßu du traitement des ces questions par Mediapart comme pour les questions sur l'√©nergie o√π on sent un dogmatisme.
J'esp√®re au moins que vous donnerez le contradictoire aux personnes accus√©es."

N‚Äôamalgamez pas de potentiels d√©linquants avec l‚Äôislam . L‚Äô√©glise a couvert ses pr√™tres mais l‚Äôislam n‚Äôa pas de clerg√© donc n‚Äô√©crivez pas n‚Äôimporte quoi

Je suis surtout d'accord sur la neutralisation des complices.... les journalistes faux-jeton notamment.
"Je suis pas √©tonn√©e dans les milieux ferm√©s avec des grosses sommes d'argent c'est certain qu'on faisait taire je l'ai v√©cu je l'ai connu  dans d'autres milieux et oui √ßa se passait ainsi. Mais c'est bien on avance, de toute facon se taire a un prix un poids de culpabilit√© et de conscience c'est horrible. Donc autant parler et il y a aussi un prix  tout combat m√™me petit a un prix. Mais cest commme √ßa que ca avance que ca change. Le mot, la parole, est importante tout le monde n'a pas cette chance d'√™tre √©cout√© √† travers un m√©dia. Et tout √ßa l√† c'est la voix de toutes les agress√©s, j'ai subi aussi jeune et je sais ce que c'est, et je me suis tue car j'avais personne et je savais que plus ces agressions javais pas l'√©nergie de subir plus car le pognon ou moi j'√©tais rien c'est une bataille donc force a tout √ßa vraiment."
Le Spectacle est visiblement peupl√© de gens d√©traqu√©s mais c'est logique.
Exactement .....

No surprise so far. I hope to be surprised by anything being done about it.

"Now that Malayalam industry has started this, I hope other industries too follow the same"
Palki as far as I know AMMA is not state run.  It is an organization started by the malayalam film actors for the welfare of both the actors and actresses but it is very clear it's for these hooligans and not for any woman. The state run  is the film academy.
So proud of the Hema committee for putting this through. This will cause some birthing pains but it will help woman all over India to bring up a new standard. Malayalee people telling the truth and taking responsibility. So proud of the Malayalee people for taking this bold step. Every industry should learn.
"For those of who are saying that Mollywood is shameful, Keralites are shameful let me ask u, u guys think these kind of things happen only in Mollywood?? It‚Äôs everywhere !! Now Mollywood is on focus because  their actresses showed courage to come out n speak and unlike what happened in Bollywood many big actors like Prithviraj,Jagadeesh coming forward in their support, even the audience majority of them are standing with the victim, the revolution is big enough the entire members of executive board in AMMA resigned, I hope every other industry take it an example"
"It‚Äôs not a meToo movement, we already had a meToo movement just like everyone else. This is start of a new movement."
This should continue across the industry
Salute Kerala for bring this out‚Ä¶ imagine if this will happen in another 100 years in Bollywood‚Ä¶ Kerala always leads the race
"On a serious note, if entertainers can have a sense of decency to resign at the first instance of accusations, when will our elected representatives in parliament show this level of decency in the face of greater accusations and resign?"
"I think every film industry will have such things, it is just a matter of time to get exposed."
This is just a beginning in the Indian Film Industry‚Ä¶
To anyone still defending these actors.. I hope you open your eyes one day
"1:19 AMMA is not a state-run body ,it is an association of Malayalam movie artists. It is run by these movie artists.  Kerala state government has no role in the functioning of AMMA."
Very soon every other Film industry is gonna go through this same issue. Hope Judicial system is gonna take appropriate steps
its not 4 days but 4 yrs they did not release the Justice Hema report!
"Glad Palki is reporting on this issue. But some serious errors noticed. AMMA is not a state body. This was started as a collective by few actors and grew into a larger association over the years. The government kept the report under the wraps for over 4 years without publishing. Eventually published when courts and others got involved and forced them. Even now some parts as not published. Also, the graphics and in the beginning part of the video is very misleading. I regularly watch this channel. I have noticed some major reporting errors when Palki talks about American politics and election campaign going on now. I am a Malayali who lives in US. Now I am wondering how much of the things I hear here about other areas that I am not familiar with is true or false. I still like this channels compared to most others out there. Hope Palki's team will strive to be more truthful."
"Kerala always lead,others should follow"
"Miss Kerala ex-winners died in a mysterious car accident incident and some celebrities and high profile figures were involved, nobody talks about it anymore!"
I always thought Palkis information was right but now I doubt! Always don‚Äôt portray this issue as something that happens only in Kerala! U should have given a wider perspective!
"The movement brought by the women in the film industry in Kerala will be done in other industries.. They deserve to be congratulated. Especially in the current situation in India.

Ôøº"
"This is not a mee too palki. .To all those people who doesn't know. Hema committee, which is under Retd judge of kerala high court Hema madam which is commissioned by kerala government as an aftermath of the sexual assault case of an actress  in  2017 ,  its only formed in 2017, doesn't mean it was started working it was on paper, and there after she took 2 years for study ( including all film lightboy to actors to directors)  and  report framed as per the standards of reports. These are allegations , so to avoid defamation , they are curated , which is the proceeding of the law in this country. And there is a 7 member investigation team by ips officee including 4 females, now the victims have to comeforward and give case.  And amma is an actors federation not any state run, because palki said so."
1:45 It was the Kerala government sat on the report not AMMA
AMMA is not state run...it's a private body!
"One of the rare occasions where you disappointed me, Palki. You say you have been tracking this story from day 1, but it seems no proper work has gone behind your/your team's research. How can you make such basic mistakes? AMMA is an association of Malayalam movie artists. It is not a state-run body. They did not sit on the report, the government sat on it for 5 years. The movies made over 1000 crores in the first quarter, not 100,000 crores as you said. And the current allegations from women have nothing to do with the report. It's so messed up that the perpetrators will escape and the good ones will eventually spoil their names."
Now Keralalites have shown the way in bringing out the truth..Will other states follow..?
What started in Bollywood was me too movement. Is there a WCC equivalent...an organization by women actors? Did the state govt work on a committe like the Hema report?
Just have a committee in Telugu anr Tamil  snd Kannada and Bollywood you be even more surprised
"In India, Labour laws don't apply to the film industry. Bollywood is the best example.
Unfortunately none of the government is keen to reform film,  entertainment & fashion industry"
I hope mollywood becomes safe and respectable place to work for women.
Kerala has set a precedent by being the first state to openly confront this problem within its film industry. I hope this will inspire other regions to conduct their own investigations and contribute to a healthier and safer working environment for all.
Now you know the reason why they say Kerala is educated? At least the women artists from Mollywood have the guts to come forward and form a committee. Who knows what's happening in the media world
Kerala is like Japan. Society is so rotten on the inside but everyone tries to paint everything so nice that an outsider would always see it like a wonder.
Thanks so much for not sidelining the news of Kerala thanksssss‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ incredibly great ful coz PPL should discuss this.....this topic is not getting enough attention from north
"Not just Mohanlal, every executive members resigned."
The interesting fact is that there has been no response from artists from any other Indian film industry - just wondering why..üòÇüòÇüòÇ
If such a report comes in Bollywood ‚ò†Ô∏è not only women there will be exploited men as well !!
Malayalam Industry leading by example. All the other film industries need to retrospect as well.
Im digressing here but can we appreciate the news reporter for her absolutely beautiful way of speaking. Love watching her speak
"Me too has to come to Tolloywood and get the truth about heroes, Directors and producers."
"Atleast some committee is there speaking about this issue in Kerala. Other state governments , police, & courts sitting silently like they don't know what's casting couch & like it never happened or happening in the film industries of those states.
Many actresses & actors talked about this happenings in other film industries but no state or central government reacted on these issues."
I hope the rest of the country finds courage to expose the bad apples too.
"One thing i deny Palki is, she is trying to generalize things here."
"But years later still no report, news section from you on misuse of section 498A..
Nothing nil...
 showing only one side problem.. Instead of ground level real life treating issues faced by good men's..

Great journalism.. üëçüëç"
"Hope these investigations bring back the focus on bollywood. So many deaths, drugs, trafficking and rumours of the casting couch, but nothing happened."
"Great work to the Malayalam movie industry apart from making great movies ,Now, for taking action before other Indian states. Also kudos to AMMA office bearers to step down on moral grounds !"
"Palki..This sure is story line in the entertainment industry..allover India or rather world over.
Hats off to hema committee and the Malayalam actresses who dared the devil's"
Why only film industry is coming out in this Me Too campaign where often the body contact of male n female is called as Acting ? üòÇ
"AMMA is not a state run body it's a private body, just and association of actors"
This should put up a pathway for similar movements to reveal what‚Äôs going on in other film industries in the nation . It‚Äôs a shame indeed .
Kudos to all actress üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè

Malayalam actress had the courage while others dont have..tats it..
"All this is there in every workplace-- even in old times-- but then things were not as complex as they are now--- even in buses , trains and walking on the road  these things do happen.As long as the world is there sexuality will exist"
"It's a shame and I had recently watched a couple of movies based on liberal, socialist themes. Well, unfortunately in India the left liberal gangs are way too active. If a person like the UP chief minister Shri Yogi Adithyanath has a solution, they protest b**chch and moan about him being cruel, on the other hand they go on a propaganda saying women are not safe... specially blaming Modi Ji. This state is not run by BJP otherwise there could have been a lot going on internationally, from BBC to Al jazeera."
Its been like this for a long time good its out now
Heard it a raging topic among all‚ù§‚ù§üéâüéâ
The irony of the situation is only because it is Kerala the world will know about this..I can bet that it is worse in every other Indian film industry but sadly no one will be the wiser‚Ä¶
Good job ..
"It's KERALA. That's why the news is coming out. Because the audience itself is much more self aware and has higher social standards and morals. For Tamil, Telugu or Bollywood such revelations will take 200 years. Just like everything else Malayalam is going to be the starting point of cleansing this misogyny too. :)"
"Can we keep this rolling , have a committee in other film industry too üòÅ"
But why Mohanlal resigned if he is clean.  He should speak out and come clean
Sexual predators abound in Molywood. It has been there since the beginning..Now the stink has come out. Hopefully this  will be a new beginning.
"They disgraced the the noble term ""a.m.m.a."" !üòÇ"
Pretty sure there are darker and sinister stuff happening behind the screen
Awesome presentation ‚ù§
"palki is misleading people by saying ""Amma "" is a state run, because of her hatrid she haven't followed the facts this timeüòÇüòÇüòÇ."
Even firstpost took it upon to clean swipe  AMMAüòÇüòÇüòÇwhat a shame for us  keralites
4:01 A hundred thousand crore!!!
this is an offline video and in that she said hundred thousand crores instead 1000 cr . They didnt edited or reshooted. just released the false information
I‚Äôm starting to doubt her credibility as more and more videos come out where she is seen speaking half the truth or just blatantly categorizing
Ask Mohanlal why he is resigned ?
"Stop calling it MeToo, this predates the MeToo movement! And for the love of all things good, stop calling it Mollywood ü§¢. Nobody calls it that here in Kerala. Malayalam Cinema will do."
Imagine going to a corporate company for an interview and the interviewer says if you adjust you will get job. There will be huge uproar. Art is also same but the industry operates it differently. There are no contracts for junior artist or technicians sometimes. An office boy in corporate will have contract but not in cine industry. There should be some kind of strict audit and law.
"It's not just the ""me too"" stories that have been dugged out. Some of these actors/actresses are even pointing out the existence of an upper caste lobby in the malayalam industry. Palki will never utter a word on it. The rest of ""Palki"" and her politics says the reason."
Mr Mohan Lal acting masterbution during film fare function for that mummutti and other actors mimicking for his act
Hema Committee Report shows The Real Kerala Story
It‚Äôs the follow-up which is more important. The sexual predators must be punished so that it doesnt happen to anybody else. What happened to singer/dubbing artist Chinmayi shouldnt happen to any other victim/survivor. Chinmayi accused Tamil lyricist Vairamuthu of sexual misconduct during the metoo movement . Since then Chinmayi has  been officially banned from dubbing work in Tamil film industry until now. Vairamuthu didnt suffer any penalty
As a Bangladeshi its very common every Where.. I didn‚Äôt expect from kerala üíîüíî i really feel bad..huge fan of Malayalam Movies
How they have not learned from the MeToo movement in America is beyond me. Why would the continue to still do such a horrible thing
4:01 mistake
Change your title‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs misleading
"So many heroine have been taken on faily basis by so called mohanlal and Mam hotty 
Honey rose 
Rasmika 
Nayantara 
Tapase 
Eliana 
The list is big 
Its same in bollywood and hollywood 
So no difference 
Few days drama then new heroines will come and join the industry for money name all will enjoy like before"
"When is Bollywood going to publish  their ""Hema report""?"
CBI must investigate
"This is a movement to malign south indian film industry, specifically Malayalam Film Industry, by the rivals. Malyalam artists are decent people.  These incidents are much more in Bollywood than all of South India combined. Yet no one talks. . They cant stand South Indian/Malayalam movies doing so well across India/globe. Shameful!!"
"No other film industry or state gvmt in India will have the courage to set us such a judicial committee to enquire about the exploitations among top influential  actors. Exploitations happen across all industries, but the backbone to identify, acknowledge and take right judicial steps biaslessly to correct the problem, is unique to Kerala. Thats because people are informed and their rational thinking is beyond hero worshiping. More power to people üëç"
"This wont finish with this , the accused and the hiding ones will be caught and they will be forced to answer .  people will not allow this to over just like that .  with this hope other industries will also wake up ."
It gonna remain the same until women produce or people would like to watch women star centric movies..
"Who are these 10-15 men?
Please mention their names"
It is not a state run body. Its a body made by the malayalam artists themselves for the welfare of the industry and its members. Moreover he resigned now so he is not obliged to speak or comment whatever the media wants. We don't know who are the real culprits and the real abusers until then rather than blaming everyone the people should wait for the report and the court verdict.
üëèüëè remove the dirt
A m m a is not state run..please Correct it
"While saying that we live in the 21st century  , not only in the film industry do things like this happen , it happens in every industry , politics , sports , name it and this sexual harrasment occurs . Saw one clip where Adv. Kapil Sibal walks into a room where there was a gathering of senior lawyers and one senior lawyer was busy on his phone . Sibil was greeted but he was not very pleased on seeing the seated advocate . The clip shows an advocate telling the seated advocate to stand up and pay respect . Is this hierarchy ."
"Nothing ain't gonna happen, these actors have huge fan following in Kerala,"
"Resigns say it all!! 
Such a shame of so-called educated state."
Namasthe PSU üëç üëç üëç

It's not state run association!
Even hollywood has the same....every film industry shud be  under scanner...but i dnt think that media wud take it forward in the same way that kerala media has taken it
So sad. Such hypocrites. I can‚Äôt watch Malayali movies in the same light anymore
"The headline is misleading. The executive committee was dissolved including President and Secretary. When you point out Mohanlal's name some may interpret it as he also is facing allegation. He resigned his post as President taking moral responsibility. 
So the headline should have been executive committee dissolved including President , rather than Mohanlal resigned due to #Me too"

En toute impunit√© pas sans üòâ
J'ai toujours aim√© le bon sens de K√©vin Razy.
"MERCI! C'est important d'appuyer le point essentiel et d'oser exprimer ton opinion. Je ne fais pas partie des femmes concern√©es par cette affaire mais j'ai fait partie de ces femmes, nombreuses, pour qui la justice n'a rien fait. Moins de 1% des plaintes pour violences sexistes et sexuelles   m√®nent √† une sanction p√©nale. Et encore! Encore faut-il que la plainte soit prise par la police... Pour ma part, il y a des ann√©es j'ai pouss√© la porte du commissariat en tremblant, ai v√©cu un moment horriblement malaisant sur place et suis repartie sans qu'on ait pris ma plainte, davantage traumatis√©e qu'en y rentrant. 
Alors oui, quand la justice fera son travail, on n'aura plus √† faire justice soi-m√™me. Mais bon, avec des hommes pareils √† la t√™te de notre gouvernement, corrompus et/ou complices de ce genre de d√©lits, on a bien compris qu'on ne pouvait pas compter sur nos institutions par les temps qui courent! A nous de faire bouger les choses! Alors ce genre de prise de parole comme la tienne, √ßa compte dans la balance et √ßa fait chaud au coeur ."
L'affaire Th√©o en dit long
"Bon, d√©j√† force aux victimes. Peu importe tout le bullshit que l'on raconte on doit commencer et finir par √ßa, c'est le plus important.

Ensuite ben.. C'est compliqu√©..

C'est compliqu√© et effectivement tout les probl√®mes d√©coulent en r√©alit√© d'un seul probl√®me qui est la fa√ßon dont sont trait√© les victimes aussi bien par la police que par la justice.

Si la police et la justice ferait leur travail correctement on en serait pas l√† √† devoir juger, √† devoir douter, √† se demander si l'on pense correctement ou pas et √† culpabiliser de ne pas savoir.

Donc √ßa c'est vraiment la chose qui doit changer en priorit√© et tr√®s rapidement parce que du coup personnellement √† mon niveau de personne lambda, m√™me si pour ce qui est de l'affaire Seb Mellia j'imagine que Florence Mendez est suffisament intelligente pour savoir d'o√π proviennent ses t√©moignages et que, ce milieux n'√©tant pas non plus si grand, la place au doute est quasi-nulle, ben concretement il ne me reste plus qu'√† croire aveugl√©ment une seule personne qui porte la parole de 20 autres sans avoir la moindre preuves de quoi que ce soit ou, si j'√©met l'id√©e que j'ai pas envie de croire quelqu'un aveugl√©ment, passer pour un salaud tout √ßa √† cause d'une poign√©e de fonctionnaires et de magistrats incomp√©tents/aux valeurs louches/dangereux.

Tout comme je pense que se faire justice soi-m√™me n'est pas une solution mais dans ce contexte encore une fois emettre cet argument c'est prendre le risque de passer pour une raclure.

Alors est-ce qu'il y aurai pas d'autres m√©thodes pour faire en sorte que la parole des victimes soit r√©ellement prises en compte par exemple via des associations qui auraient plus de poid ? Je sais pas et puis on ne devrai m√™me pas avoir √† se poser ce genre de question.

Encore une fois que ce soit au niveau de la police ou de la justice il faut vraiment que ca bouge parce que m√™me si on met un stop √† la carri√®re d'un violeur et qu'on informe le publique sur ses crimes c'est peut-√™tre toujours mieux que rien mais sans condamnation ce ne sera toujours qu'une demi sanction.

Il faut que les vieilles mentalit√©s masculinistes/patriarcales/malsaines au sein de la police et de la justice soit √©radiqu√©es une bonne foi pour toute parce que les _""vous √™tes s√ªr que vous ne l'avez pas un peu cherch√© ?""_ les _""vous √©tiez habill√© comment ?""_ et la complaisance parce que _""il a du talent""_ ou m√™me simplement _""il est c√©lebre""_ c'est juste plus possible (sans parler de la corruption pure et simple).

Bref. Il faut que √ßa bouge.

Fait chier.. Et forces aux victimes."
Il est Ayatollah maintenant Kevin Nazi?
Il est tout seul la ?
"Kevin Razy toujours l√† √† donner des le√ßons... Il fera moins le malin quand il se retrouvera avec des plaintes de meufs sorties de nulle part qui l‚Äôaccuseront des pires choses juste parce qu‚Äôil est connu.

Qu‚Äôelles aillent porter plainte, et qu‚Äôon laisse la justice faire son travail plut√¥t que de prendre le risque de briser la vie perso et pro de quelqu‚Äôun en se basant sur des rumeurs."
Cest une d√©nonciation calomnieuse pas de la diffamation il y a des femmes aui ce servent de √ßa pour r√©gler des comptes. Ca mest arriv√© et cest vraiment pas drole car cest une insulte aux vrais victimes.....
