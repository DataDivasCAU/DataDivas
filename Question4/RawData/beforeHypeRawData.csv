"Sounds like Tony meant what he said, but apologized to cover his ASS. He was being an adult BULLY to that woman who had the courage to SPEAK UP to him."
"Exposing a perpetrator empowers one, that takes courage, helps protect others and is down right heroic. Remaining silent, that‚Äôs a right...because of fear, because of PTSD, and other issues."
Don't apologize to these witches. You stand your ground. He was absolutely correct. He didn't hurt a soul.
Stand your ground Tony. You were correct. Don't back down to these movements.
He was right this is why causes become cultish
men are losing their careers without due process. just because she says it where is the evidence.
Damn I am a girl. I am so disrespected!
#whynow
Mgtow
Tony is a bad man
"Rapist will come out and try to defend themselves and their fellow brotheren with many reasons but it only make them look guilty, like that show when they caught them with cameras trying to pick up kids for sex.   Compare his demeanor to one of those rapist who think they can get away with  rape, murder etc 

I see a rapist"

Tony Was right. Stop crying
men are losing their careers without due process. just because she says it where is the evidence.
"Je suis un HOMME. J'ais vu des jeune filles se faire harceler trois fois par des jeunes HOMMES. Ils passaient en voiture en disant qu'elles √©taient bonnes. Une autre fois, dans le tramway, heureusement elles ne se sont pas laiss√©es faire.... Je me demande si ces jeunes ont fait leurs √©ducations sexuel en regardant des films pornographiques tr√®s tr√®s jeunes avec leurs portables pay√©s par leurs parents?   Les relations entre filles et gar√ßons se sont d√©grad√©s..... Dans ma jeunesse on avait un  meilleure rapport avec les filles.   On avait encore notre innocence √† 15/16 ans....On prenait notre temps pour se conna√Ætre.....Les jeux de s√©duction √©taient maladroit, on √©tait un peux gauche, mais on ne franchait pas les limites....On s'envoyait des petits mots ou un entremetteur rapportait les lettres ou les petits mots d'amour.   En fait la drague se faisait dans la douceur.....J'esp√®re que √ßa existe toujours....Les filles deviennent un peux moins f√©minines qu'√† mon √©poque. Je pense que c'est aussi une fa√ßon de se prot√©ger.....C'est triste."
Heureusement qu'elles sont toujours flinguer pas de grosse perte pour nous ahahaha
First thing is why all as harashment..?..better not to consider all as harashment...who are these bloody nonsense to make new new things in atmosphere..totally against it is...better need to change script that everything is not harashment...in the name of harashment spoiling and doing nonsense in atmosphere..you people are nonsense there..
MGTOW
Worst and nonsense among genders it is...
"I'd be very interested to hear June's view had it been a male protester being stopped by a female MP in the same way, total feminism running wild right now."
He could have ragged her round like a doll but he never he grab and escorted her out the opposite of violent
i like how in one breath she goes on about female empowerment and then in another she says we need to protect women. Which one is it?
June.....Oh dear oh dear!
"Mark Field should get promotion and a medal, not suspended."
If it was an instinct for violence how come she wasn‚Äôt hurt in any way???????
"Does anyone know that why there is NO ""Sexual Harassment"" in small cities in the Middle Eastern countries?"
"I am stunned by the niavety of these supposedly intelligent women. Their arguments are based on ""after the fact knowledge and information of who and what these protesters were"". They then base their arguments and hurt feelings based on this, refusing to acknowledge that there could have been a more sinister motive given the situation. ""Well it it was Greenpeace, we know that because they told us at the time."" To say they would have let an unknown female protester walk past them to confront two of the most senior and important people in the country and wait to see what happened truly is astonishing and reflects the type of society we live in. I have seen and experienced sudden violence both towards other people and to myself, at times committed suddenly by supposedly reasonable and calm people. I have no party political allegence  to any one and do not know this man. He did the right thing. It was not unreasonable to form an opinion that this woman meant to do or could do harm, that maybe she was not who she said she was. Maybe those at the head of Greenpeace should reflect over their own actions that put at least one person in a private meeting in fear of possible violence and putting a woman at risk of violent reaction."
clips of a white screen followed by detailed debate; I cannot follow this
Normal people will agree that Mark Field did the right thing. Only a feminist would not agree.
"First and foremost, the supposed _SECURITY_ that were there should be publicly ridiculed for allowing this person to get as far as they did!"
"I wondered whether she has ever manhandled a man?


This sort of show is part of the reason why clowns like D. Trump won. Political correctness, gone wildly wild"
No Afua that was reasonable force!
"Pandemic? Really
 Oh come on! Ffs"
What an astonishingly bad take by june
"If a female burglar broke into my house holding a crowbar, I am not allowed to defend myself."
Not what I saw. I saw a man stand up and defuse a potentially dangerous situation. Were security on holiday? Once the person breaches a private function they become a threat.
How biased and unprofessional is the lady in the middle. Violence against women is disgusting but at least here out other sides. Don‚Äôt just make up your mind that your way is the only way.
"Oh, now taking precautions is conflated with a ‚Äútoxic‚Äù backlash."
As a society we do not care about women ???? Society was and is  still being built around caring and protecting  for women.
So with their logic is it OK for me to kill a man if he approaches me and my private space?
"So... If someone robs your house, just accept it if its a women?"
Why is no one mentioning the elephant in the room in that she was smiling throughout meaning she clearly was not in any discomfort at all.
B.S... Welcome to equality.
"The video of him is blank, it is just a white screen while we hear what is going on."
Fields shouldn‚Äôt apologise
June and Afua... Public enemies no.1 regardless of what topics they discuss üòÖü§î
She also believes if a woman uses a weapon against her spouse and hospitalizes him he should be punished further.
The protester had no business entering a private party. I would have handled her the same way.
If that was a man he would have been rugby tackled to the floor in an instant.
And what if that woman was about to punch the guy
She shouldnt of been in the room ..........
"When the smart and beautiful demand the punishment of a violent authoritarian pig, it obviuosly raises the ire of all the other pigs."
Afua and June.......well that's enough youtube for today üòØ
These 2 black women would have had a field day if the protester had been black. The one with the pony tail takes every opportunity to play the race card on this show.
If my daughter was man handled by someone in this way protesting in a place where she‚Äôs not wanted I‚Äôd tell her not to be so bloody stupid.
Women complain they are not treated equally .. women complain they are treated they same way any man would have been in the same situation.
"I come from a country where I have seen a lot of violence. Living in the UK, I was astonished at the action of the MP. Anyone justifying his action should ask themselves reflectively if it would have been alright for their wife, girlfriend, mother or sister to be manhandled that way. The lady posed no threat given her demeanor and the fact that her two hands were occupied by non dangerous objects. The quality of response by most members of the panel is a reflection of the very low quality of the individuals we have allowed to shape public opinion in this country of ours. It is shameful and disgraceful . If this MP whose action shows that he views women(probably including those in his personal life) as lesser beings has any self respect left, he should remove himself from the public space and go get some help."
no video no proof
This anchor just makes me pissed...
I couldn't see any video of the attack other than a complete white screen.  Has this been censored?
He removed an intruder using reasonable force. How is this even news? Left wingers are mentally ill
""" speaking truth to power "" .............HER TRUTH. Not everyone else's"
What the hell was that opening monologue...
"Oh I do love Greg, what a complete  treasure :)"
JUNE WANTS TO LOOK WHITE SO BADLY.
June and aufa got some good old victimhood to get their teeth into üòÇ haha she was horrified haha the woman was smiling when he took her out . They give more fooks than the women does
What a joke
One cannot do such a thing in a private company let alone someone in the public sector. This was physical abuse and his reaction brings to question what kind of person he is in private life. His political career should be over and the conservative party should be ashamed for those applause. Great topic in the face of the me too movement.
"On Brazil a group of female protesters got beaten by police for doing much less, and the public opinion treated them (the protesters) like criminals hahahaha. At least we didnt lose our commom sense down here ."
That aggressive behaviour is very misogynistic. He proper lashed out on her.
All ways the same with them 2
"June Sarpong  is hot üî•üî•üî• af but dead wrong and shamefully so. Men have a ""instinct for violence"" (or protection as I would but it) as Afua said. That instinct is more prominent in some men to act when there is a threat of danger. Now to a onlooker it may look sinister but in the moment he had no idea who this person was. And even if everyone else in the room read the situation differently and didn't see a threat- HE DID. He saw people entering unlawfully and he acted as per how he felt was appropriate. 


June makes a massive jump in assuming it was because she was a woman that he acted violently.  Nope I didn;t see that. Two people can see the same video and see different things. This depends on our life experiences and perspectives. As a man I saw what Ive seen in myself many times. An instinctive protective reaction for those around me to act when I perceive a threat. 


Now the icing on the cake is June doenst even accept his apology. Shameful. really shameful. This is why men are turning against feminists. because they don't even accept out apologies when we give them and admit a wrong. Shame on June Sarpong!"
Black woman in the beginning g is hilarious. Is she doing stand up?
"Perhaps the woman might have been a nut with a knife?
I guess the guy didn't have time to play pc politics and decide whether this was an attempted assault on someone or not.
Just imagine if our police had to box-tick a form before deciding whether to intervene in a similar situation.
The man did right.
What I want to know is how they got past security in the first place?"
cancer!!!
"June is really gorgeous, just sayin"
MGTOW
Everyone join in the victim circle.
"Well if protests are not received fairly, we wont protest anymore... we will go where our protest is appreciated    STOMP"
Afua is smart and beautiful...the star of this program..her views are almost always on point
"That black woman is right. 
Mark Field should be disciplined better..."
"it was racist, if she was wearing a white dress they would have let her pass"
MGTOW
How does the future belong to one gender? I thought feminism was about equality!
Let's all agree that nobody deserves to be sexually harassed. :)
"Women: My body, my choice.

Men: My wallet, my money."
The future isn't female. It's digital.
#MeToo is causing a severe recession in the Golddigging industry.
Amber Heard has made a mockerey of this movement.
We the men who support men being abused by women are going to rise and women are going to be held accountable.  Thank you Johnny Depp üòò
I think I'll just stay home and avoid getting too close to anyone forever
"I have never been raped or sexually harraseed or bullied but my support goes to the men and women who have. Lets get rid of predators in power. Men and women who sexually exploit those beneath them. Eventually, the world needs to focus on molestation at the forefront. This is one of  the biggest crime that plagues humanity."
The future is AI
The future is robot sophiea..
why is my dishwasher not working
"I served in the Armed Forces,when in uniform i had my arse felt,crouch,and one woman tried to pull me into a toilet on a train,#hypocrites"
MGTOW is Also on The Horizon As Well
"I'm not a feminist, and this movement ticked me off for various reasons... But as a South African lady, I can confirm that there is a bit problem with domestic abuse towards women in this country."
"According to feminism, both genders are equal... Just that women are more equal."
I‚Äôm not gonna apologize for something someone I don‚Äôt know did.
"If i may ask, what does metoo and the phrase ""the future is female"" have in common? The combination makes it look like this is about power."
This move is going to cost up-and-coming marriages for years to come.
"5 years later, men understand to avoid all unnecessary contact with women."
"Against me too. Not against women but absolutely amd all the way against me too. Just because it judges the whole male population as one entity,  rather than focusing on the problems caused by some disorderly  individuals. This movement is totally and most important  blindly against half the population of the earth. My stand has changed towards women after that, because I don't know if one specific woman is a supportive or not of this movement. So I don't talk to women,  don't flirt, don't walk close to them, dont  say goodmorning  or hello to any woman, don't ask for help if I see a woman in a store, don't interact at all. In this case the movement 's ideals and standards have neen met and it is absolutely keeping me as a man - that it knows I am as a male a Hazzard to society- away from all the females of this planet.  So yes the future is female and I don't  want to be a part of this  future. Men gowing  their own way, away from women."
where's the virtual reality for how it feels like to be falsely accused?
"Men: Exsist
3rd wave femnist: OMG HE BREATHED THE SAME AIR PARTICLES AS ME!!!! RAAAAPPPEEE"
How valid is a movement if it is abandoned when leaders of the movement go silent when it involves a violator from their own ranks.  It loses its credibility.
Ita changing the world alright...for the worse...
Well this aged badly...
As a business owner I will never even consider hiring a woman not worth it
I like the virtual reality goggles to get the point across.
"We all forget the very purpose of women rights‚Äî‚Äîequality. The future is to be shared by all people regardless of sex, not just male or female."
We avoid women now. It actually makes life easier. üòÇüëç
Redpilled fellows hit like.
So much of the things they accuse men doing to them happens to men too.
"By Cultural & Economic Standards, us western women need to be grateful and conscience of our privileges and quality of lives...
#DeepPink"
Is there a VR scenario for women to experience what it's like for men to be abused by his wife?
Jordan Peterson is my hero.
Metoo. Sorry ladies no more sleeping your way to the top.
"So wait what about the guys who were falsely accused oh wait ""Future is female""."
"Millions of young men recruited for war have died as well. Mostly for the wealthy class owners of the world and mainly for mineral and oil resources. These young men died to protect and secure the rights of their countrymen (and women) to speak out freely for any cause they wished. So, in effect, young men are being taken advantage of and being 'body sold' (trafficked) on a much larger scale and for a much longer period of time because they are existentially expendable to the battle field. Women don't actually have that burden, but they do frequently suffer men's primal instincts as men often suffer theirs, only differently."
"regarding South Afirca, this will achieve nothing"
I'm so MGTOW
"All the comments are encouraging on here, it's great to seethe majority see through the metoo movement and their lies, thank you!!"
Make life more peaceful and enjoyable.  Just go MGTOW.
"Thanks for producing this content, it is appreciated. The Economist‚Äôs comment section seems to be one of the most vitriolic I‚Äôve seen, for some reason.  Kudos for this reporting, not all of us here are haters."
Metoo has made it so complicated and risky for man and women to work together that it is better to segregate them at workplace
"Me Too in a nutshell 30 years ago a man did something I didn't like.... I never said anything about it until now but without evidence, proof, or any fact believe me and punish the man assuming he is guilty and even if he is proven innocent treat him as though he were guilty. Then call everyone who disagrees a misogynist."
The future isn't women it's a robot's flying cars and stuff like that
I dont think I can ever return home from Japan.  This country is great. No bs drama and woman here are way more happier.  Both men and woman dont have rediculous life expectations.
Best way to deal with women in the workplace is to interact with them as little as possible.
this movement threatens the song baby it‚Äôs cold outside
#Metoo and #feminisn ere more negative than positive right now
"The real beauty of all this is that it will show men that they are inherently toxic, and should pursue their passions and livelihood WITHOUT women, so as not to cause them any trouble. 

Womanists, don't even tell me that you are offended by this... or even call me names... If you do either, you may as well admit that you really are NOT strong NOR independent.. and that you DO need men... and having those beliefs is misogynistic. Thank you."
2:23 why does she seem so proud and happy to be talking about this.
"Women : The future is us, we will rule the world.
Me: laughs in toxic masculinity in Saudi."
"The card board sign should read:
""The future is NOT male, nor white female"""
You just have to understand that I want to live in an equal society. The movement started because women need respect . Just never become what you fight.
WE ARE NOT OVARY ACTING IS GENIUS
"Blue: afraid, deluded, and controlled 
Red: fearless dawg, reality, and a warrior"
Im am so grateful that my country doesn't have this problem...why? Because we're too busy dealing with floods and economic crisis which looks way BETTER than whatever this is
GREAT I WANT GENDER SEGREGATION AT WORK. I HOPE IT WILL START SOON
Movements come and they go as always.
proud of every single woman speaking up! i believe you. i will always believe you!!‚ù§Ô∏è
"If men express themself emotionally they will get exploited by woman whenever its beneficial to them and at the same time get told they should hate themself as men for being a man....masculinity is a male choice for us to accept as it is and how we choose to be, if not expressing myself is part of masculinity then it should be my choice and be left to it."
Good job. This fund had successfully tightened the relationship among people from the high and low social classes
"Hmm interesting to see the massive dislikes and critical comments. In my opinion, it should start with education system. Fix that before attempting other fixes. I am glad that companies taking harassments more serious now than before so this is a good start."
"Wow, they are putting VR reprogramming devices on the faces of men now? I worked in education for many years. Female dominated industry. I have been flashed by a female coworker because i wouldn't feel how perky her breasts were. Two female bosses would walk up and rub my back while grading papers, comment on my muscles. Refused a coworkers advances on a few occasions, one would end up stalking me for over a month. She would sit in my truck leave notes, spray perfume etc. She even said she was going to kill herself over the situation; this particular situation happened in the early 90s just as companies were adopting sexual harassment training policies. So, I'm gonna sit through the rest of this video and role my eyes, thank you very much"
Me Too has affected the lifes of a thousand men at most but harmed the potential career prospects of over a hundred thousand women.
the lady says u can‚Äôt do work if u can‚Äôt have a 1 on 1 meeting but now u literally can‚Äôt look at a girl for 5 seconds
"Apparently not a single man has ever been sexually assaulted or harassed according to this narrative, what a relief, I suppose it must have been another ""Misogynistic"" hallucination of memory"
Jordan Peterson is controversial? Really? So what exactly is controversial about him? When you accuse someone with that heavy words you should be able to back it up.
"Reality of feminism 
Equal rights = yes yes 
.
Equal responsibility = fuck no no"
"It's not hard, seriously its common sense.  Men and women, would you be happy if your son or daughter or sister or friend was being treated as your talking to your co-worker, then go ahead. If not change  that behaviour"
"You know I‚Äôm happy about this. But I hope it won‚Äôt get out of hand. Also we always overlook that men can also be assaulted sexually, but so can women and they dominate that area which we need to change."
western world is wierd
Let's  use a dramatization of a situation to change things with this Virtual Reality product that will make men understand what only women see. Ok sure...
When are women ever happy?
Who else was here to read the comments about people saying #metoo?
"I've been harrassed 10 times worse than that! My whole goddamn office has been abusive to me a lot of days, more than I can count. I'm the one doing most of the work, and they talk the most shit! There's no such thing as justice in this world. U have to make your own!"
"At, my health club, I've watched, men walk away from women, the women want to be noticed by the men, but the men will leave, women standing alone, in an area, of the gym and return when the woman leaves,"
"How about using hijab,.or convert to Islam, even better.    Learn about how Islam ruling about man and woman should/must behave toward each other, But please not from biassed media."
These women should think about their sons.
"It doesn't just happen in the workplace, the harrassment also happens in one's personal life.  Never hug or touch a person unless they have agreed to it."
"For starters she's way overdone the makeup which women use to attract men while at the same time calling a mans attention to her harassment. Women are truly illogical with their emotions switching by the minute and of course are ALWAYS the victim.Men won't put their hands up and say ""Ok ladies you win"" Experienced men know how to play a woman that lets her think she's in charge and so the age old game will go on and all this bullshit will only appeal to the idiots who suck it up."
The disconnect in the #MeToo movement is that many (if not all) of the female Hollywood actors who initially came forward to protest sexual harassment and sexual assault at the hands of Hollywood producers and directors were perfectly content to allow themselves to be sexually objectified on screen in exchange for large sums of cash.  Is it altogether surprising then that these women were treated as sexual objects by the same men who paid them in the first place?   Women can't both use their sexuality as a means to get what they want from men and then at the same time expect that men will not look at and treat them as sexual objects.
"Grats feminists 

You‚Äôve completely cancelled human interaction altogether 

Hope your happy :)"
How come they never interviewed the accused for their side of the story .
MeToo?  Why did you all go watch 50 Shades and Magic Mike?
"(cough, cough) Johnny Depp"
"This man :¬†""it's the suspicion of men that is clearly not in anyone's interest"" SORRY, you mean in MENS interest."" This man gives off big :  oh no ... the consequences of my actions vibes"
"Do we still need feminism? Yes.
Do we need feminism in developed countries like America? Absolutely not."
"Remember, Ego's, we have masculine and feminine inside of each and everyone of us; in past lives you have been both. The rising of women does not mean the fall of men, maybe monsters but if your not one of them you have nothing to worry about. The healthy masculine without insecurities of his own power will never feel the need to put someone below himself, he will not be afraid of having his other half in an empowered state. Thank you Lilith, Kali Ma, Mother Mary, and Lord Sananda and all the brave sisters and brothers of humanity that are stepping into the light of truth and justice. I bless all ignorant, asleep beings who can't see the need for this movement with pure love and light, with pure source consciousness, with balanced feminine and masculine energy. ‚ô°‚ô•‚ô°‚ô•"
I hate this war of women vs men. We all have our unique strifes.
Scientists need to hurry up with those sexbots
Is it gender equality?  Or feminist superiority?
MGTOW is the last hope
"I think that some things are being mixed here. I totally agree with the right of women to not being sexually harassed, and I think men who do such things are not real men. However I don't see why the video also want to speak about the gender disparity in positions of power. I remember Jordan Peterson saying something about this issue, which is: there has been plenty of time for women to reach positions of power, and yet there is this gender gap there. I don't think that women are less capable intellectually or anything, but I do think that men and women are different. There's no such thing as the ""right to be in a position of power"", because, by definition of power, that's not how it works. There might be rules of course, written or not written, but I don't think gender distinction should be done to favor one or the other.


Clearly this is a lot (infinitely) more complicated than this, and obviously I think it's good that women speak up about untold harassment."
"Brilliant and in-depth video. Me too is somehow blindly approved with Japanese women, but this is supposed to be the reality.
In Japan, unfortunately, men's mentioning to Me too movement itself can make him up as immoral and discriminator."
Humans will exploit any opportunity of any movement.
I hope that all fake-accusers will be sentenced and punished.
Do petition abolish feminism and other root of problem metoo
time has no gender.
Now media will spoil the career of Emraan Hashmi by showing this repeatedly so that after big directors will not take him in their films.This bulshit media did the same thing with Sushant singh rajput
The same women who pretend to be so offended made 50 Shades of Grey the fastest-selling book of all time.
"All feminist women want:
1. The authority of a man
2. The advantage of a woman
3. The accountability of a child"
Chivalry is dead and a feminist pulled the trigger.
">MEM NEED TO STOP HARASSING ME !!!


> OMG THERE ARE LIKE NO GOOD MEN ANYMORE THAT WILL MAKE THE FIRST MOVE"
"Feminist want the strength of men, the benefits of women and the responsibility of neither."
"Actually I‚Äôm a man and I love the fact that I no longer have to buy dinner or drinks or hold a door or pay for a movie for a woman. 
If I see a woman with a flat tire I can drive right by because she is my equal and can change it herself.  Woo hoo !!"
Just ignore the feminists hate. If they don‚Äôt want a man to be nice to them. Fine. Just walk on.
"(10 years from now)
 ""I'm so lonely and sad. ""
 ""Me too!"""
"This is why prostitution should be legal all over America. If men are not allowed to approach women, give them compliments, and asking them out, the only option is to pay for sex. People would ask why so many young men are virgins, and it's because shit like this is discouraging them from being man enough to talk to women and asking them out on a date."
Congratulations women you ruined dating. You‚Äôre so strong and independent now.
"Be respectful? If respect got men laid, we'd live in a nation full of gentlemen"
"Women: ""Men stop harassing women and leave us alone.""
Men: ""Ok, we'll stop and leave you alone.""
*A few moments later.*
Women: ""Why aren't men approaching women and ignoring us?""
Men: ""Huh, what the f*ck?"""
This society has become fucked. As much as say something nice to a woman about her physical appearance these days and you‚Äôve harassed them.
"Feminism's misandry ruins dating, families, children, communities, companies, vacations, everything. That is what this hate does and now we must deal with the fallout."
Take a shot every time the lad says ‚Äúlike‚Äù
Ive dont care about women at all anymore. I feel like Austin Power who lost his Mojo.  I'm certainly very suspicious of them and seems like I'm better off leaving them alone entirely.
"- If when a woman accuses a man falsely and it is proven the man was innocent, then the woman receives the punishment the man would have gotten.
- If when a woman attacks a man, the man can defend against it with no restrains the same way he defends against another man.
- If when a war happens, and all men and women get drafted equally.
- if when the life of a man and a woman is threatened by a fire, car crash, or boat sinking... both lives are considered equally.
- If a woman stopped getting children custody and all goods automatically in divorce regardless of how they act towards the family's welfare.
- If a man is not expected to do favors for a woman regardless of his thoughts, and is not doing so he would have not to be considered a bad man...
- If there was true equality..."
"‚ÄúChivalry is dead, and women killed it.‚Äù

"When my son gets old enough to be interested in girls, I'm getting him a chest cam to wear to school and work for HIS protection."
"Watch C.S. Lewis's ""On the Vital Necessity of Chivalry"" radio talk"
"Men, don‚Äôt shy away from being masculine or chivalrous. There are still women out here, like me, who appreciate that and want that in a man."
women really dont get it that men can easily be accused for sexual harrassment and yet men are seen as weak and sad because they refuse to take that gamble?
There are times where I absolutely hate the me too movement. I mean support those coming out and standing up against abusers but the other part of me hates the fact that so many have blown this out of proportion and look for ways to get offended just so they can start shit. I‚Äôm actually a victim of a liar who framed me and ruined my life in college. The people of the me too movement who get offended so easily are the central reason why I get triggered and hateful towards others so easily. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to control my anger because I have Asperger‚Äôs Syndrome and Autism but on the surface the average person wouldn‚Äôt know it. The me too movement wants guys like me to apologize for how we are yet they don‚Äôt want to apologize to us for triggering and turning us into the monsters we never wanted to be. How about instead of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a freak! Stay away from me‚Äù try ‚Äúwhat can I do to help this person not be so mean.‚Äù I don‚Äôt judge others but something I definitely need to work on myself is not retaliating back and stooping to their level. The problem in my life is not those around me. The problem is me trying to get revenge on those and striking back twice as hard with an iron fist. I‚Äôve realized in recent months that the longer I hold onto that anger and resentment the more dangerous it becomes. So I try to spread positive and motivational messages to others struggling.
"A man held the door open for me yesterday and i said








Thank you."
"‚ÄòNo Means No‚Äô is intended for getting physical, not being chivalrous.

If a women has a problem with chivalry, or makes a fuss about a man trying to be persistent; she‚Äôs not worth the time."
"Don‚Äôt touch, don‚Äôt look, don‚Äôt touch. They get pissed if you, they get pissed of you don‚Äôt. 
You‚Äôre better off getting a dog."
Feminist speak a bunch of crap. The majority of women want a masculine man. Ignore the women who tells you to leave her alone and go for the women who appreciates your masculinity
"The world seems to have lost its way in every way‚Ä¶.

The scales are not balanced."
Women in the work place have even become a liability to gay men
"They don't mind if you flirt with them.......just as long as they're attracted to you. Which is fine. Except the punishment for not fitting that mold is public persecution and maybe imprisonment. If you're not wyte you can say what you like to wyte women. If they start to ""get offended""  simply pull the race card. Genius. You ALL have it worked out."
"I had a young man recently compliment me on my appearance. He followed up by saying ‚Äú...if I‚Äôm allowed to say that.‚Äù I felt bad for him that he had to second-guess whether or not paying a compliment or saying something nice to someone would be okay. I mean, this is what young men have to worry about? Telling someone they think they are pretty? Crazy times."
"My brother (at the time a 15y boy) was wrongly accused for rape together with a friend of his. 3 days in jail when the police didn't let them sleep and started interrogating them every half hour and threatened my 15 year old brother with violence if they didn't plead guilty.
Interrogation without sleep is forbidden in the Netherlands but the police did it anyway.

After three days the victim showed up and looked through a one sided blinded window and said she didn't recognize them, so they where free to go home without the police saying sorry to the boys.

I have three other stories where boys and young men are wrongly accused of rape and how society continues to blindly side with the so-called female victims.

It is scary how much evil can be done by women with the blind support of police and society. Women that are blackmailing to get their way in live are the worst!"
Social media and dating apps have done even worse.
I think easily accessible internet porn has done equally if not more damage in a lot of these same aspects
That ad made me switch to Dollar Shave Club lol
That was the most confusing part of the ad to me. It looked like he was going to go talk to her. What is wrong with that? How else are relationships supposed to start if people don't talk to people they find attractive?
So that‚Äôs why I struggle to connect with women I‚Äôm afraid of being seen as the bad guy or someone of ill intention
I absolutely love how this has just 100% fizzled out of existence
"Like, why can't.... like, college students like just ask like a question..........like wtf?"
"Well said I actually had an experience where I wanted to give back my ex girlfriends sweater I didn‚Äôt feel right to just throw it away and I miss her but her sister works at a store and I made it very clear. I just wanted to give this back with no other intentions whatsoever, she appreciated  The gesture, was being polite to me in person, only to text me telling me to leave them alone, and although she appreciated adjuster she doesn‚Äôt want to have to be forced to interact with me just because she works there which baffled me because I‚Äôm thinking why doesn‚Äôt she like me because I dated her sister? Or is it something more but anyways great video"
Me too should be made illegal.
"A guy : I don't want anything to do with a woman.
Me : #MeToo man."
100% has...women and men are weird socially and can only really communicate through means of text or whatever
"Dating will be like the Bumble app, where women have to initiate contact first"
"Chivalry has always been worthless, and there has never been a better time to be a man because it was never easier to be more of a man than the next guy than now."
I honestly try not to make too much eye contact with women.
"This is what women of today wanted.

They wanted to be strong, independent and proud in hopes only the Kens and Chads approach them. If it was an everyday man then they'll just look upon them with disgust and think of them as something low like a cockroach or thinking they only have one thing on their mind.

Most likely one of those Kens or Chads they are with would do them wrong then they will be like ""Oh where have all the good men gone?"" 

Well those good men are around, you have only went for one of the bad ones

Not only that, thanks to the MeToo movement certain men such as myself don't want to have the trouble and drama of being accused of something that is not true such as harassment even don't want to deal with anymore heartbreak and betrayal being left for someone else.

The question here being asked is what happened to dating? It is because men want to protect themselves and do not want no more hurt then they have endured. Of course their is that old stereotype that ""Men are tough, Men can endure pain and real men do not cry"" this and that but that's were they are wrong because their comes a limit where we just cannot take it anymore and become more cautious of ourselves where we do not want to deal with no more heartbreak and drama.

To those certain women who made this happen and including the MeToo Movement, Congratulations you have ruined dating and you wanted to be independent well then there you go, be careful what you wish for."
"The least masculine man I have ever seen asked a question about masculinity. Every other word was ""like,"" a millennial verbal tick that signifies fear."
Don't even think about going out with a woman without getting it in writing it's okay.
"Real women still want chivalry and men with manhood, my woman loves it when I open the door for her and chit like that, the loonies are the ones that don't want it and don't deserve it"
"Glad I found a great woman to be my wife! 
We have had a wonderful marriage since 1991.
No wonder marriage is at an all time low. 
I can't imagine being a young man trying to find an honest girlfriend let alone a wife. 
Even talking to a woman or anyone else for that matter is a no win minefield.
Is this why so many peope

I continue to be a chivalrous masculine man. 
No metro-sexual wimp dog for me.

I just refuse to be intimated to give up my core values and I am not afraid to defend them.

"I did that very thing... It was during a ""oktoberfest"" in Michigan, I had seen the girl twice with a couple of hours so I went up to her, introduced myself to her, told her she was beautiful and that I would love to go out with her.... She said sure we met the next weekend for a few drinks and dinner, I couldn't get over how ""hot"" she was but there we were. It wasn't the most comfortable date I ever went on but I was a total gentleman...she said she had a good time... Now when I look back I probably could have been a little more aggressive.. But the date just ended with a kiss on the cheek and that was it....
I was in my early 20's. This was in the late 70's."

Social media for the most has destroyed human psychology forever and with time it‚Äôs gonna get worse.
That‚Äôs part of the reason why the birth rate is low in the US.
That was the one part of the ad that really blew my mind. It looked like the guy was just smitten and wanted to talk to her. The hell is wrong with that??
It‚Äôs sexual harassment to her if she finds you unattractive. If you are handsome to her then it‚Äôs flirting.
Things haven't changed over here in the U.K.  Women still like sex.
"This kid used ""like"" more than my 12 year old son, it was hard to listen!!!"
"You really have to get off social media and go after what you want. Don‚Äôt let the haters get to you. Misery loves company. Although in this case if everyone isn‚Äôt talking to each other then everyone is alone .... together. Lol. 

We all know what going too far is so we don‚Äôt need people making up rules on how to live our lives. Yes there are bad people but if you assume someone is bad then even the smallest awkward moment made from nerves of talking to a pretty girl will seem bad."
I understand completely. I slapped a women on the butt the other day and she took it the wrong way. Lol

Doesn‚Äòt Gillette‚Äòs future earnings depend on men successfully asking women on dates (long term that is)?
"Of course it‚Äôs wrong to go up and talk to a woman or interact with a woman, and if you were eventually to get to know that woman and have any sort of intimate relationships that‚Äôs physical and sexual assault if things go bad,to be safe there should be no contact between the sexes"

"Watch the movie if I remember the name correctly, ""Cherry 2000""."
"I don't understand why guys were offended over that particular scene. While I hated the ad, it's obvious that they were implying that he was not going to approach her respectfully and instead was going to catcall/be a nuisance. I mean, look at the build up and his reaction the moment he saw her, haha. Also, approaching a woman who's walking somewhere is probably going to be a bad move in general."
Yeah but guys stopped pursuing and asking girls out back probably in the '90s? Maybe before then? Maybe this is because of feminism? Maybe this is because gender roles have been skewed and men are less manly and have been discouraged. I'm just saying I think this is not a new thing

"Welcome to 2015, I guess?
If a crappy ad from a couple of years ago ruined dating for you and completely destroyed what you consider manhood or ""chivalry"", maybe you should do some self-reflection on whether you have any self-confidence or self-control left.
OR you're using this as an excuse or an explanation for why you suck at it?
Both possibilities are sad anyway."
I think men should always make the first move.
"It‚Äôs really not that hard...you don‚Äôt touch people inappropriately, you don‚Äôt force yourself on someone, you don‚Äôt stalk someone and you don‚Äôt harass someone at work. You can still ask someone out at like a bar or something like normal people do."

Watch more on #MeToo here: http://bit.ly/2EX1vZd"
It pissed me off so much how they got into false accusations so fast. I‚Äôm glad that other lady brought that up.
"""Parenting"". Shows only mothers. Does Vice not realize that they left out half the perspectives needed in a conversation like this?"
"""I feel worried all the time. ¬†Like worried that he's doing good in school, worried that he's ok at practice, worried that nothing's bad is happening to him..."" Holy Freud!"
Well I guess Vice doesn‚Äôt need to include a father figure.
you need to label satire when you make it
Ok vice is trolling at this point...
To all the people commenting these young male athletes need to treat women like people not like objects need to ask yourself how do these girls treat these young men in the first place? Why do you think they're throwing themselves at them in the first place? I tell you why - they view them as success objects. Objectification works both ways.
Talk to the father's
I'm so confused. The woman of the far right side of the couch said that she would dismiss accusations against her son because she knows him but then she said that you are not 100% with your son all the time and you never know what he might do.
I‚Äôm too ugly to worry about the #metoo movement
I feel that Overbearing mothers fathering their sons is not a viable replacement for a solid father figure in a young mans life.
I wonder why there is not a dad in this interview
"At least, the moms with sons are waking up more than the moms with daughters."
A man breathed in front of me without my consent. #Metoo
"Great video vice! such important discussions, keep them coming"
"Statistics prove that having the paternal mother and father in the house, raising them as a team on the same page is how you will get good outcomes. Depressing men and overcorrecting them will eventually lead to a situation no women want, and that‚Äôs a lack of strong men."
"Sometimes being so young and naive, you only think you're smart... I was that 20 year old who thought I was smart... ended up hanging with the wrong crowd, getting bullied... life is a lesson, yes."
lol the dislikes tho
"I dont understand why people dislike this video this much. Those mothers are criticizing the metoo movement, so that should basically attract all the right wing trolls. Wheres the problem with this video I just cant see it, somebody tell me please."
"I found this discussion very interesting. It was also cool to see this discussed in a way that doesn't immediately try to discount the perspective of one party or another but tries to reconcile them.

It seems like some commenters found a way to be offended anyway, but I don't see any of them citing specific statements in the video that they disagree with. It looks more like a general anger at this whole social phenomenon."
the amount of well deserved shit that vice gets in these comments gives me hope
My 16 year old son is mgtow . This is why. Too much drame he claims.
These moms seem like part of the problem
Keep perpetuating your victim mentality vice... it seems constructive.
This is the worst day in the history if vice
It's not just atheletes.  I grew two beautiful men by myself. This is so self indulgent to me. I come from a country full of atheletes.  This is a global age old problem and needs a far broader conversation
"Only a father knows what's going on in a young boys head especially through puberty. To leave out the fathers in this discussion is simply shows ignorance especially when you put ""parents"" in the title."
an actual sensible take on the topic
I agree with the moms when they say me too is over corrected
"Saying that an athlete has ""more to lose"" is really false. We all have things that are important to us, an athletic career isn't any more valuable than another persons reputation or career. Any  woman who speaks up against an athlete for sexual assault, no matter the truth, is going to come up against scrutiny and some threats from other people. People usually know the implications of speaking up because it's a big risk that may not pay off."
"I have to agree....I was wondering where the fathers are. Also....it's kind of interesting how their views flip flopped once they had sons. I know parents believe the best about their children, but children hide a lot from their parents. I know my siblings in a different way than my mom knows them ;)"
"No one seems to want to learn progressive, healthy, fair, respectful, mature relationship skills and do the psychological and emotional and self-improvement labour work of building relationships anymore.  Long-needed change is being idly complained about and rejected when that is the ONLY thing humans can count on in life besides pain and death.  So, how and where do people with above average ethics, values, convictions and personal politics find those rare others who are ready, willing and able to do the interesting and enjoyable work of relationship building?  Always said is, ""surround yourself with good people.""  Well, where ARE those ""good people""?!?"
how many garbage videos can vice post in 1 day?

She compared the Me Too movement to the Opioid situation...
Everyone should see this
"Wow I'm disappointed. Having a conversation about how not to raise a rapist is really important (especially to me personally, because I was assaulted). Yet the questions mainly revolved around them being apologetic and why. Here's a tip for these moms: if you want to raise a good boy, don't view him as such without him proving it through his actions. If you give your son the leeway of being moral, simply for being your son, then YOU ARE RAISING MANIACS. -.-"
"Your different son.
Why Mom? 
You throw a football."
Where‚Äôs my vice gone?
Is vice satire now? Like the onion?
4:45 I think they should get a room
"The #MeToo is a  real issue but it is one that can get out of control.  Any accuser, male or female, should be invited to take a polygraph test to support and give credence to their accusations.  I know these tests not 100% but it takes some coaching and practice to defeat one and most people aren't aware of that.  The results of the test can be kept confidential but the fact that it's there would discourage false accusations and there's far too much of that going on."
"There was a time NO means YES and YES means let's have an orgy... 
Over correction is better... Just like when you try to grade essays or papers... The first one is the hardest to judge until you read all the papers and learn to correct those biases as you go on... Fear of the Exception  rather than the Rule is more harmful in any society..... Killing a human being is not all bad.... as we tried to classify them to  self defense, murder etc to make room for what justice really means...and lines are drawn here too..."
This one is alright compared to the other videos Vice and has made about the movement.
I wasn't a fan of the short haired interviewer but every one else had good points not sure why this video is getting so much hate
No men in the couch I love it
Jordan Peterson full interview please
"So sad to see vice go this way. I guess it's time to move on and look for some more objective news sources. 

Terrible shame, especially for their field reporters doing such great work overseas. To have them mixed in with this obviously guided conversation with a strict agenda is a waste."
Idc what the sexual assault definition is to her the only thing that matters is the legal definition
"I feel sorry for those womans children, poor souls."
This video should be studied for what it says about today's social environment.
And Vice has gone the way of Vox. We have lost another news source.
Im gonna get rich off a consent app.
Athletes should be scared. Young men should be cautious and respectful. People need to be monogamous now more than ever. Never mind getting with a guy or girl to just have sex and move on.

Overcorrected..? This must be a joke. So many points were missed & mothers who speak with this uncertainty on the issues of RIGHT AND WRONG are doing a disservice to the movement.
Using Tobani on this is just wrong. Cuz this is her time wasted.
Another discuss about abuse without men on the panel. When will people figure it out.

So where does the #metoo movement stand in the way Machel Wolf treated Sara Sanders?
"Reason and justice go together a lot better than emotion and justice. This jury was very emotional. The judge allowed a lot of women to testify that Cosby did bad things to them way back when, and that poisoned the well. The ground has been laid for a lucrative civil case against Cosby----and all his accusers and Gloria Allred stand to gain."
Who wait this late to say something
"So given the fact that one of the victum members is from ""playboy"" that means playboy is a honey trap briggade waiting to happen. FML!"
MeToo is useful for helping actual abuse victims. But they also say you've been sexually assaulted because someone looked at you funny. This is not justice and will hurt the MeToo cause.

Of course they couldn't wait to be on camera.....again.

"This is the first time I've seen a comment page be so much better than the video itself. I'm tired today's adults (I'm a part of this generation born in the 80s) who get triggered easily, think it's ok to demonize ALL men over the sins of a minority of men, etc. etc."
"Keep up with the good work sponsoring and publishing horrible content guys, you're on the right track to self-destruction. Thank you very much"

"The things the men supposedly said wrong:
Guy 1 - didn‚Äôt want to talk about politics on the first date (A pretty normal thing to do). Saying that a movement possibly has gone too far despite its good intentions (a reasonable stance). Asking a girl he likes to come and watch/support something he enjoys and participates in (a very normal thing to do).
Guy 2 - tries to see a positive side to a dark outlook on life that she brought up (a healthy thing to do). Apologizes when she takes it the wrong way (a good and polite thing to do). Indicates that some men do bad things but trying to find a way to get her to trust despite that (a normal thing to do).
Guy 3 - feels uncomfortable with her dark assumption of him (very normal for a first encounter). Tries to sympathize with her and make her feel more comfortable (a very normal and good thing to do). Expresses frustration when she intentionally misconstrues his sentiment on multiple occasions (very very very very normal thing to do).

You are the problem, not whatever you think they mean."

You know... I became a Times subscriber because I like to think that my money is going towards a bastion of rational thought and a champion of truth in the world.  Seeing this video... I regret being a Times subscriber.

All I want is a woman who's sane.  I guess we're both going to be disappointed.
this hurts the New York Times brand. clearly journalism can't be neutral anymore. why do you need a bias? I am a liberal and I can't take the clear pandering/bias on this. unsubscribed.
Why is the #me too movement ignoring the #120db movement ?

Edit, yeah it's satire."
So let me get this straight. Pun intended. Is there nothing that this woman won't find offensive? Is this a parody or satire of liberal lunacy?
I'd like a woman that hasn't had twelve men in her.
"This is a glorious critique on the venomous double standard and obsessive disdain at the heart of modern feminism and SJW culture in general.  Bravo, and well done."

"I was really struggling with the intent behind this video. Is she a poe, is she serious, is she mocking men, is she mocking femenists? But No i just watched her standup and other videos. She‚Äôs not self aware or smart enough to be doing this on purpose. I truly believe  this is just a moment where the art really supersedes the artist. As if her hand in writing this was unknowingly guided by the most holy and lead to create pure cosmic tragicomedy. And like all of Gods creations, it fractals up and down infinitely so that there is always another layer of comedy encasing the last and always another layer of tragedy encased within the next."

"You keep singing this song

You go back to your strife.
When you're not screeching in the nude
Your crying for his money, dude

I can't think of an end to this song, because you won't end yours."
"This is how people who have never had normal social interactions think normal social interactions go.

This is why genuine news companies shouldn‚Äôt delve into satire. It just comes out as stupid and cringey.
"Over 27? Too old, do not want."
It's not satire if you actually believe it.
"I fully believe the reason I've spent my entire college career locked up in my apartment online with my friends is because:
1. I'm more introvert than extrovert
2. I'm convinced that college culture/most women will dislike me for my non-con-formative views.

I was told for my entire life that college was suppose to be a great time in my life, and there have been good times, but its mostly been me cringing at how brainwashed society has become in believing the narrative.

Its sad too. There are a lot of great guys out there that are good people, but society and the media have convinced half the population that they are evil. Most of these guys are super normal and coming from humble backgrounds. But I'm white and male so I guess playing video games, hunting, reading, writing D&D stories and grabbing a drink with my friends makes me ""privileged"" or a bad person.
Despite my parents working from paycheck to paycheck for everything we have. A voice in the back of my head tells me to wait until everyone else grows up and I'm well established in life before dating. But I'm young and I want to find someone special in my life. We want the same thing, but I'm not accusing you of crimes you haven't committed."
This is either the perfect spoof or tragic beyond words
"This is a satire, i refuse to believe otherwise."
I genuinely can't tell who this should be insulting towards.

Great to see women like you pushing MGTOW forward your truly doing the lords work. Well bye and thanks for all the fish.
I absolutley salute this parody. It's an accurate example of feminist overreacting and acusing men of things they dont even have proof upon. Their movement became a parody just like this video is showing it and i think we need more videos like this to show just how ludacris it became.
"This is not satire, this is a crime against comedy."
Pause at 1:10 for the only comedy this video offers.

"Call me a definitional purist all you want but this doesn‚Äôt fit the definition of satire. 

Satire is ‚Äúthe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues‚Äù. The only way this is satire is if she is criticizing herself for her beliefs which she clearly isn‚Äôt since she is presenting one perspective: her outlook on the world. She believes wholeheartedly in what she says and believes she sneak this by as ‚Äúsatire‚Äù by adding a ukulele... not so fast!"

We need to fight this battle of people abusing their power for sexual.  Don‚Äôt try to end the entire war of social injustice in this one battle."
A man breathed within a 20 meter radius without my consent. #Metoo
"I appreciate the guy on the right offering the conversations he‚Äôs had with other men who know they‚Äôve done something bad to another person and are worried for themselves. 
Because they know. They know what they did.

I think we need to hear from the men. The men who know what they did. If they can come forward and admit it without repercussions and apologize like that one guy did on Twitter, we can maybe have a conversation on how prevalent this is and address the reasons why this happens with men who are otherwise good people."
"I think it's terrible that some women are being told that because they were ""only"" sexually harassed and not assaulted that #metoo isn't for them."
all of this can be proven in a court of law of course...
"I like this conversation. This is a people issue, not a women's issue specifically. It affects more women in the sense of surviving some negative experience or whatever, but it's a people issue and I feel they addressed that pretty well."

O.K. So what was the point of this whole conversation ? I'm confused üôÑ
To add to my last comment this I‚Äôm just trying to poke at the fact that vice likes to imply that white privilege is a inevitability at birth when they haven‚Äôt looked at the cultural differences in the way that colored men and white men grow up on a mass scale I‚Äôm not trying to generalize colored men as one thing in whatever you want that to be in your own eyes or as all white men as a general thing because there are outliers on both sides but all I‚Äôm saying is vice needs to look into the differences in decisions that both cultures make and not just say white privilege every time they want to make a argument on why there are outraged men who happen to be white.
Segregate the workplace.

Down vote
"sexual predation is obviously a behavioral issue based on false and harmful belief patterns. It is a fault in the way we think about and perceive what is sexually healthy and appropriate, and how to respect our own and others bodies. Much sexual abuse today also relates to how men see women; many times as objects rather than people sadly.. they do not regard us the same level of humanity and depth of experiance as them.. when we are seen as more different than similar there is room for one to treat another as sub human."
Such an awkward format
There is one simple solution for all of this literally... just don't hire attractive women or girls. No matter what they will find a way to get the man / mentor in trouble. There are a lot of young guys who would be super appreciative of the same mentor-ship and will not accuse the guy and ruin his reputation and life. I'm just saying seems like a pretty logical and easy fix to me.

30 years ago one summer I can't remember at who's house or in which town it was in but vice definitely sexually assaulted me in a room at a house party allegedly
"When I contacted a law firm in December to see about the possibility of a suit against a medical firm for mal pratice,i requested only men to talk with ,i tried to explain that this was personal and with my age,the climate at the time,and just not trusting professional women at the time,i though my request was not out of line. Of course the women in the firm felt this was an insult to them. WTF am I supposed to to. I am near 60,i grew up in a different age. I did not want some lawyer aquise me of anything. Right now most of my friends see this as a power grab. To bad. This should have done this differently."
it seems 2 out of the 5 are lying... Is this a common theme?

"When a movement results in the infringement of the rights of others, in terms of DUE PROCESS, it should NEVER be allowed in the court system. If MSM continues to support unprovable accusations, then THEY should be held liable. Part of being an ADULT, is TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS, which means not putting yourself in a position when and where abuse may occur. Sexual abuse has been around since the beginning of time so you can't claim ignorance, but you might be able to blame your mother for not raising you with any common sense. You'd have to be born, and raised, under a rock not to know that at the forefront of the majority of these abusive environments is in the entertainment industry. Any idiot knows that. But apparently we're having an IDIOT epidemic right now. If the roles were reversed and you had to PROVE your innocence...could you? Think about it...although thinking really isn't your strong suit, is it?"
"the absolute biggest fucking joke out of this is meryl streep wearing black for ""solidarity""  she's the one that started the petion to have roman Polanski allowed back in the country because she thinks raping a 13 year old girl multiple times is fine."

this dudes smile makes me mad and I was having a good day.
Same everywhere...you people twist macdonalds words. HE DID NOT SAY HIS FRIEND SUFFERS MORE THAN HIS VICTIMS. HE SAID HIS FRIEND LOST EVERYTHING IN A DAY WHICH IS SOMETHING HIS VICTIMS DIDN'T EXPERIENCE. NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE??????!!!!!!!
74%of men when asked would they cheat on their partner if 100% they would not get caught said yes. 74%of woman said no ..... but had a friend who would.

"Norm has never given any fucks about whats PC. His jokes dont always land, usually because the audience is too dumb to understand his humor, but he's one of the smartest comics working today."
"Victim? How tiresome. Somebody said something nasty about Valerie Jarrett - that doesn't make her a victim unless she makes herself a victim. Newsflash - she really DOES bear a striking resemblance to Ari. That's not an attack, that's a simple fact. And Louis's victims? Hey, when a guy asks you to his hotel room at 1 in the morning, what do you think is going to happen? And what DID happen? He whipped out Mr. Wee Willy Winky and started playing with him. Certainly an ""ugh"" moment, but, hey - just leave. At no point did he force himself on anyone. Call him the sick individual that he is and move on...But to proclaim you are somehow a victim? Long live Norm McDonald and his no-nonsense point of view."
‚ÄòMy producers are crying‚Äô! Lol
Norm can do no wrong so people don't understand what he was saying and he apologized to people because they lack humor and go through life that way.
"If there were any justice, Norm would have inherited the Tonight Show from Letterman."

FALLON'S PRODUCERS WERE CRYING CAUSE THEY WERE LAUGHING SO HARD NEVER CHANGE NORM
Who knew Raymond Arroyo was so witty?
"""he went on to say, his friends, unlike the victims, suffered more than the victims did""

The reason why you stopped putting the exact quote on the screen for this part, like you did for the parts before, is because Norm never actually said this. This part is a lie."
These two people talking are adults. They are not children.
I stand/laugh with Norm.
Thank You! Great segment
"Why did the Fallon staff cry over Norm's remarks? He defended Fallon, no?"
Norm is one great honest man!
If what he said offers this kind of result there is a serious mental health issue that needs addressing.
So this guy is saying Fallon‚Äôs team are upset with norm because he defended Fallon. Flawed logic.
Norm is a comic surgeon and he just removed another tumor from the left's face.
"Yeah, lots of people are glad the witch hunt is slowing down. I'm disgusted by how people are coming out with their own story of a gropy date or relationship gone wrong and ruining people's lives and careers.  Norm has nothing to apologize about.  He likely only apologized to keep his show."

I'm not surprised by the hand dryer thing. Granted they were much better than the older kind of hand dryer. Shame.

Tarana Burke articulates the problem so clearly. Good interview.
"In tears, this childs story breaks my heart."
Tarana Burke is so good ! An American hero!
Well said Tarana Burke
"Tarana---I have long held the belief that unless and until MEN CONFRONT OTHER MEN BEHAVING BADLY---this dynamic won't really change.  When they see it, confront the man directly....don't be afraid.  STAND UP FOR WOMEN.  Only then do you deserve to feel righteous."
Absolutely shocking ‚òπ

None of this is your fault."
Thank you!
I will never try and convict any man based on an interview. Take me to a court and let the factual evidence decide one way or the other.

Now is the time for the good guys to step up and protect these children."

SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING JOE BIDEN AND BILL CLINTON WOULD DO
Me too was stopped because it was taking too many DEMOCRATS down. Epstein stories will get quiet when more DEMOCRATS start biting the dust.
he told the truth and sometimes people don't wanna hear the truth
People actually blew Tony Robbin's comments/actions out of proportion - the highlights of the incident do him no justice.  He pushed the lady in the video as an example to demonstrate a point not because he was trying to enforce his will.  His comments come from a good place.
"Probably the most positive person in th USA and they pull this shit on him. He explained himself very well in the video. Victimhood is not the answer. The shame is yours. You have dig deep to see the issues and bring yourself to overcome them but they are yours. Identifying the abuser is only a very small first step in healing. And money won't help you heal caliber - it will likely make it worse. Heal-up, get on the horse, and ride again!"
"He is absolutely right. 
I have friends with businesses that think the same way.
Why? Because women have become a financial liability for companies..."
I‚Äôm sorry but he‚Äôs right. A lot of men are now wary of being involved with women in the workplace especially.
"Robbins was right, despite the apology. I'll always make sure never to be alone with a woman in an office anymore, now that I know I can have my life wrecked 20 years after on a simple allegation."
His right you know
He is not wrong though
It's terrible how some people can say something wrong by mistake and get so hated for it. Can't even talk anymore. What in the world are we doing to each other?
If you don't try to understand what's he is saying you run the risk of missing the whole scary picture
"If he was a victim, he has the right to an opinion, enough said"
My problem with the #metoo movement is that it is sexist in nature. Both women and men can be sexually abusive.
He's only saying sorry because people got offended by his remarks but he was saying the truth & the truth hurts.
I mean as a woman it wasn't cool what he said but it's the truthüòê
"Here we go again, if you dont agree with these people they attack you. Everyone wants to be a victim. SMH"
A movement that can not take light criticism is moving in the wrong direction.
he is RIGHT
How is that offensive?  Tony Robbins is a genuinely nice person. Everyone is making it so you can't say anything without offending someone. Absolutely ridiculous. He shouldn't have to apologize. He will because he's nice and never intended to hurt anyone.
"If a man is uncomfortable hiring an attractive female, he is the one with the problem, not her.  Victim blaming 101"
"I understand Tarana, but he's right.  They are both right."
"Of course he's sorry and wants to get connected with the women of the Me Too movement. Any other response would cost him profit in his business of motivating others. He's a businessman, plain and simple. His bottom line is the almighty dollar."
He‚Äôs right
His contribution to our world reaches far beyond what you can see in this short news clip. If you do not know who Tony Robbins is I encourage you to learn more about him before jumping to conclusions.
He‚Äôs right but it doesn‚Äôt matter if you say anything that doesn‚Äôt support me2 100% that will try to ruin your career
Tony is just saying the truth
"Never apologize, It'll never be good enough."
I am a woman and I find nothing wrong with empowering women not to label themselves as victims and live life as a victim
'Me too' is malevolent.
good for him
"Always someone going to mess things up for someone who helps thousands of people! He's just telling the truth! This country can't handle that anymore or? Some of you woman wanted to be treated the same well here you go!!!! How about ""COMMON SENSE MOVEMENT"" or isn't there any left?"
I thought the #metoo was a meme.     :/
Why not encourage ppl to hire both men and women and encourage employers and employees to keep their hands and nasty comments to themselves and dont make false accusations so that they won't have any problems in the work place!!!! His apology comes after he realized his mouth could cost him money!!!!!!!!!!!ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î
"He‚Äôs. One. Hundred. Percent. On. Point. 

Eff metoo. It‚Äôs only hurting women and is just a ploy by women who want their five minutes of fame. Gtfo."
i stand with him
"I heard the same thing, men are now afraid to hire women.  For the first time, since I was a young kid in the 1960's, I am starting to see all male office environments again.  Not a woman in sight.  No problems, no drama, and no lawsuits."
Listening to his comments I don't think he was against the me-too movement I think he's against those who utilize movements like this to lie cheat and steal which cheapens the movement for those who are actually Overcomers from traumatic events.
That's why I don't get hired sometimes. Female bosses are too attracted to me ;)
"I‚Äôm not for or against tony.  It seems to me he is saying victimhood will get you nowhere (i agree with that), but then he is also saying if you fight they will just fight back (this is what the demonstration with the lady was meant to prove), so is there no point reporting anything according to Tony?  He also said ‚Äòhe without sin cast the first stone‚Äô.  Just because you‚Äôre not prefect doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt stand up for right and wrong and justice. That isn‚Äôt the meaning of ‚Äòhe without sin‚Äô.  It means don‚Äôt judge someone‚Äôs moral failure, but applies to consenting adults.  The metoo movement was about non-consensual behaviour."
Robbins should not apologize for telling the truth .no one wants to hire women.why would you gave how week
Why apologise for being against victim mentality
Tony Baloney
"""I'm not knocking the Me Too movement. I'm knocking victimhood"". So you go to a self help seminar then complain when you're challenged for having a victim mindset? Robbins whole program is based on creating your OWN happiness. Personal accountability and I don't mean that in the sense of blaming yourself if you went through a tragic experience, but owning up to your life and the hand that's been dealt to get through that experience. You are responsible for your own happiness."
Let's bully him for saying the truth....
He was right though. This is like apologising for the crying baby.
"Isn't what Tony Robbins is saying yet another way to shut women up?  Shame them for coming forward? Telling them if they continue they will not get job offers from male employers because ""they"" are afraid of women.  This is the same attitude I've heard for the past 50 years.  Tony you are off base."
"He did not say anything wrong to her, she misunderstood him"
dont care love always!!  Tony rocks
I FORGIVE HIMüôè‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ
"One time a girl ""accidentally"" touched my finger. I am a survivor üò§üí™üèº"
Tony saved thousands of women from sex trafficking this year alone... did you mention that?
The only reason Tarna (whatever the hell her name was) is because women can't have their lives ruined by false allegations
He's still alive?
"He is absolutely right. 
Me too bullshit mouvement made it very dangerous to hire women with all the false accusations and so on. 
Women brought this upon themselves."
He has nothing to apologize for.
#himtoo stop objectifying him!
Tony was right stop hating on Tony !!!!
"Cannot say I disagree with what he said if one realizes being a victim isn't healthy whereas being a survivor is empowering.  Tony Robbins is in the empowering business not the pity part victim movement!   

And men as well as women get harassed and assaulted so lets stop making the #MeToo gender specific.  And unlike many people who misspeak at least Tony Robbins apologized!!"
wtf he's right abc take this L he's right
Be more professional sometimes you need to pick and choose your words to get your point across and someone that's been abused he should have been more selective of his words he should know better
if you have to go find outrage like a heat seeking missile so you can feel better about yourself ... then you got bigger problem than abuse.
"Fu-- his excuses and apologies...he made profoundly unenlightened HARMFUL comments and as a "" non victim"" he will have to take his lumps..SUCK IT UP!!!"
#YouToo Tony
So what was the big deal?
This is the problem there are so much people getting offended by something so small mostly women that just give them another reason not to hire you. You can't even listen to something without getting people offended. What makes you think you will get a job by complaining and that's why you things will stay the same because that's all women do ( not all ) I have to put that so people don't get offended anyways they complainin and wonder why they are in the same place maybe if you look at what your trying to get equality you should see what we are doing because you are busy worrying about what other people think will guess what that's the difference we don't care what you guys are doing well just get shit done. But it's getting harder not to care because you are dragging all your problems to us like it's our fault.
Who in their right mind would pay and listen to a person telling them nothing?
"It's about our humanity, fellas."
I don't like this guy but he was right that Metoo is a culture of victimhood.  What hes said since has been complete bullshit aimed at not losing followers.
True üò¢
Yuk
Opinions expressed fail
Good news!!!
Tony's an aggressive sob..landshark con guy
"Life, doesn't end when we die from this physical plane, what happens is our physical eyes eyes close, and our spirit eyes open; now, if during your physical life you believed in God and called upon the name of Jesus, when you leave this physical world your souls will go straight to Jesus, where you will enter into the kingdom of heaven to live forevermore. However, if you didn't believe in God nor call upon the name of Jesus, when those people die their spirit eyes will open into a world of condemnation, and they will be judged and will suffer the finale of spirit death; choose life! Follow no man or guru, swamis not preaching directly from the Holy Bible and following God and Jesus, also read that book yourself."

"I am a women and I am not part of the me too movement.  He is so right and women need to get a grip on things.  You are distancing yourself from men and other women.  First of all I would agree that you should be respected by men - that first comes from respecting yourself.  Not the say that all women are responsible for what happens to them....but it you act and dress like a slut you will be treated like one.  Yes, I have friends that have been raped.  And yes there are horrible men that take advantage of women....but come on....some of you need to take a little responsibility.   First I would say to stop idolizing the celebrities that have the demonic symbols in there concerts.  If they are controlled by demons why would you want to be like them?"
"The deciding factor is not whether or not to hire an attractive woman!  You hire the person most qualified and if it's the woman,  make sure your male employees know how wrong sexual harrassment is! Make sure they know the repercussions of making any woman uncomfortable! Make sure the males know that sexual harrassment/assault/misconduct will not be tolerated whatsoever!! What the heck is this childish behavior about it's better to not hire women at all?!  GTFOH thats a damn sorry excuse for not wanting to do the right thing!"
Tony is no ones fu*king GURU!
True story!!
Tony Robbins is about money and nothing else.
Boo fucking hoo.
He's a fake! He bullied that girl. A sham.

He's right.
He is right
Nice to see Tarana Burke get a shout out for once
Give them credit for their work but don‚Äôt say they inspired a movement. They did not and credit to them for admitting it.
"Simplest answer: Tarana Burke. To be fair to Milano though, she never claimed it was her idea."
"5:10 ""In 2006, Tarana Burke founded the Me Too movement and began using the phrase ""Me Too"" to raise awareness of the pervasiveness of sexual abuse and assault in society.[2][10] Burke has been supportive of the #MeToo hashtag.

The phrase ""Me Too"" developed into a broader movement following the 2017 use of #MeToo as a hashtag following the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations. In October 2017, actress Alyssa Milano encouraged women to say ""Me Too"" if they've experienced sexual harassment or assault, and the hashtag went viral. Milano quickly acknowledged Burke's earlier use of the phrase on Twitter, writing ""I was just made aware of an earlier #MeToo movement, and the origin story is equal parts heartbreaking and inspiring"".[3][24] Burke has been supportive of the #MeToo hashtag.[3][25]

Time named Burke, among a group of other prominent activist women dubbed ""the silence breakers"", as the Time Person of the Year for 2017.[15] Her speaking engagements have included Brown University in February 2018""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarana_Burke


""And even though Burke‚Äôs been doing this advocacy work for over 10 years, it was Alissa Milano‚Äôs tweets that helped catapult the hashtag into a full-blown movement. While Milano‚Äôs intentions weren‚Äôt to steal away all of Burke‚Äôs tireless and thankless work, her star power managed to shine bright on this awful topic of conversation.

Maybe this is why many Black women feel left out of this movement, because the actual creator of it has been marginalized by the very movement she spawned. Burke told ESSENCE exclusively, ‚ÄúThe world responds to the vulnerability of white women. Our narrative has never been centered in mainstream media. Our stories don‚Äôt get told and as a result, it makes us feel not as valuable.‚Äù
https://www.essence.com/videos/tarana-burke-explains-why-black-women-dont-think-metoo-is-for-them/"
"I do think it‚Äôs a little unfair to say they were protecting them. The people that knew and said nothing probably had the same fear the victims had. Those people had money, power, and influence. When you have bills to pay and moths to feed it can be very scary to charge into a losing battle."

"This has become fashionable these days to put allegations against anyone.  If it is true, let her file a report with the police rather than blowing up in the media for publicity.  It appears the BJP media machinery is working to tarnish anyone questioning their policies."

"Well he may or may not be guilty. I don't know what the truth is and I don't take anyone on face value. 

The only thing I must admit is he did not deny his allegations gracefully! A supporter of #Metoo calls allegations against him as ""keechad"". 

Well, the wire has an article saying ""Film maker accuses Vinod Dua of sexual harassment"". The Wire is not in agreement with Mr. Dua on this stand."

I'm staying single.
"""Women waiting for men to make the first move""
Men: that's gonna be a long wait."
The word... 'Mgtow' is getting closer to mainstream conversation
"Men are more reluctant to approach women.
Even I am and I used to do it a lot. 
You did it to yourselves ladies."
At 48 years of age and retired. I'm just sitting back and enjoying the slow demise of western society.
A man can't lose in the dating game if he never plays!!! MGTOW has grown in recent years because of the #MeToo movement.
A man who truly loves his children will NOT conceive them into a world like this. Keep them inside fellas.
"I was at Aldi.. when I saw a woman struggling with her arms filled with groceries,  I had a cart with a  bag of potato chips,  I offerd to help her,  I knew that I  was wrong from the moment I opened my mouth..she told me exactly where to go, I will never help, or offer to help, another woman as long asI live"
"I think it's funny how everything is the man's fault, never the woman's fault."
MGTOW more popular than ever. Good job women!
She's right about the part '...but women aren't willing to change' .
Keep a close eye on those birth statistics. Should be interesting.
Now alot more women can grow old with their cats !!!!
"This is the sad reality to life, where women always expect a change in their men but want their men to accept them for the person they are. Women want to get treated like queens with out treating their men like kings...we make everything about our women we empower our women only for our women to compare themselves to us men and want the same treatment as a man. There's a reason a man is called a man and a woman is called a woman, what the world needs to stop doing is comparing the struggles of a man to the struggles of a woman, our struggles are not the same"
"Dating is dead.
Marriage is dead.
Birth rates are crashing.
48% of all newborns are to single mothers.
Good luck trying to reverse these trends with VAWA, The Duluth Model, YesMeansYes, femcorrect diversity hiring and promotion quotas and then piling on MeToo.

Before it was ambiguous and people could laugh it off.
MeToo has removed all of the masks.
Now there is no question that women now represent a massive legal and financial liability and risk to any man, and to any business as well.
Thing is, how can women undo the damage already done?
They can‚Äôt put the genie back in the bottle such that men will be sacrificial and deferential all over again."
"Thanks but no thanks, I'll be staying single and protecting women from my toxic money."
"If men are saying they want more women to make the first move, then why are women complaining men aren't being more assertive?  ...in this era of the ""liberated woman""?
Hmmmm??"
You are correct for more than just dating culture. I stopped dating and my hiring practices have changed drastically. Once you realize that you don't need women. You will realize that your need for material gain disappears and you'll find yourself doing what you want without being held back by a modern materialistic women.
"It was too late before I figured this out üòÇ got kicked out of college for looking at a girl I didn‚Äôt even remember her face. She said she felt threatened for a whole week üòÇüòÇ and I don‚Äôt even remember her face. 

Good job women gooooood job"
Gillette's commercial said that guys shouldn't talk to women.
"I just quit asking women out.

Problem solved.

If a woman doesn‚Äôt ask me out, I don‚Äôt go out."
"I lived by these rules all my life before this movement and it served me well:

Never initiate physical contact with a  woman. Let her make the move.

If you're alone with a woman like a coworker, make sure there is either a 3rd person present, the door is open or it's in public. 

Wait until she makes the first greeting."
"""Why don't men open up?""
Men opened up and we got ""Muh emotional labor"".
""Why don't men discuss their issues?""
Men approached you with times they were abused and we got Johnny Depp.
""Why don't men approach anymore?""
Because you said feminism was destroying harmful gender roles and because we got metooed."
"The later you marry, the more likely it is you stay married? How do you figure that? Almost everyone in my parents generation have been divorced at least once in their lives and their parents, the generation that saw marriage as a holy oath, actually stayed married until death and they usually got married in their early twenties.."
"I'm indian before this movement my parent's advice ""don't go alone with a girl"""
It's caused many men to start looking overseas for partners. The western women seem to have become overly sensitive.
I changed my behavior to avoid women altogether. Worked like a charm. I have money and mental health now.
"""Women waiting for men to make the first move"". Men: What move?"
My financial situation prevents me from finding love too. I like to keep my money!
"""A smart man learn from his mistakes, A wise man learn from other's mistakes""
Sometimes the key to win is to not Play the Game in the first place."
I will never get married. I don't want to lose all of my savings to divorce lawyers.
"I'm part of the 51% of men who have changed their behavior. Never will be alone with a female who is not close family. Never will give assets to a female who is not close family. I assume that a little over half of all single women are infected, and all are willing to make false accusations if they disapprove of anything I say or do."
I love it. More and more men avoid  the bad contract called marriage.  Great news.
"Women will be all alone, more vulnerable and more miserable in the future. Riding the CC until 35 and then asking the question ""Where are all the good men gone?"" isn't going to help anyone."
We're not being reserved out of respect for a woman.  We are reserved because we now have the fear of being socially and financially persecuted.  Metoo has achieved its goal but the outcome is extremely one sided.
Look up Mgtow on youtube. Then you'll understand.
SINCE I BECAME MGTOW  MY BANK ACCOUNT HAD AN INCREASE OF 300%  IN LESS THAN A YEAR. I AM LOVING IT.
"The laws are crap, don't get married, and don't help women when they can't breathe, if you give them CPR, they'll sue you for assault."
"How men have changed their behavior:
They avoid women at all costs out of fear of being falsely accused or misunderstood what the woman was thinking in her head.
Congrats."
"This woman is not even trying here. Her male colleague asks how and what changes, and we get her own random postive interpretation. He asks if it's an OVER correction, and she erases the word over in her reply directly. Wtf, can she not hear him correctly or just that deluded?"
Yeah i don‚Äôt even speak to female humans anymore I‚Äôm not trying to get accused of anything.
This didn‚Äôt age well.  Marriage rates and birth rates are way down.
About 8 years ago I remember telling someone that because men are all assumed pedophiles by society I no longer acknowledge  the presence of children unless they speak to me first or are with an adult. And if I find myself alone in a room with one I leave that room. I've  since adopted the same policy regarding women.
"No wife, happy life."
"She's sugarcoating men losing interest. There is no light at the end of the tunnel for women, but there is for men. Men are being more productive, and women are needing men more than ever. Feminism has really backfired. The more things change, the more they stay the same. We're becoming a different kind of tradcon."
Women are being manipulated to believe that movements such as the MeToo are good. The result is simply that no business owners managers want to be alone with a women anymore. The risks are just great when compared to hiring men.
"I'm 44, and women caused me a lot of stress. I like women but not the hurt and pain behind it. I found I'm more happy when I'm by myself"
"I agree...let women send me flowers, chocolates, ask my number, ask me out for a dinner and explain to me why I should date them sacrificing my time and energy and I will consider if I will accept her invitation or Friendzone-her...until I will be asked out I can enjoy my good time alone...."
"MGTOW, an understandable response to Feminism & the ""Me too"" movement. Congratulations ladies!"
"I thank the Lord I was born in the 70s . I am happily married for 18 years...
Nowadays a woman can ruin a man with false accusations . Even when it is proven that the woman lied , nothing happens to her."
I love they interview a woman to describe man's positions.
Doesn't affect my dating life.  I'm a misogynist.
"'Riding into history'. Yep that pretty much sums it up. They rode everything they could get their hands on, and now getting a commitment is history."
Getting you name dragged through the mud because you have a bad date is not changing your behavior is saving your life.
"Women:   The wage gap is unfair !   Equal pay equal work !
Also women:  I want a man who earns more than me, and I refuse to settle for less.
Also women: There are no good single eligible men out here for us !"
Don't be surprised if the number of babies born this year falls exponentially. #WeAreDone
"If men are so wrong or inappropriate, let women do all courtship and work in dates. Let them make the first move, let them make conversation interesting, let them work hard to get a man, let them propose and get rejected. Let them teach us the ""right"" way. Men are not acting more inappropriately, they are just slowly starting to NOT ACT at all. Get it through ur thick heads."
"By changing the way men date, you mean gave up, right?"
"Dating has definitely changed.  When I go out women hit on me.  Maybe it‚Äôs because I have a home by the beach.  But I don‚Äôt say that.  I don‚Äôt even take dates to my house.  I take them to a studio apartment I rent month to month.  I don‚Äôt take my nice car either and I won‚Äôt be a simp and take them to nice restaurants.  Maybe they think I‚Äôll pay off their student loans üòÇ Nope to that too.  I‚Äôm free and not going to ruin it.  I retired at 49, home is paid off.  No car payment, no credit cards.  If I want to work I do.  Then I go on vacation a few months."
"'m an employer of my (and another person's) company, and we both specifically avoid hiring women for numerous reasons, one of them being the false accusations of sexual harassments.  Yes, we accept applications from women due to legal reasons, but we haven't hired even one female employee in the 11 years the company ran.  It's just not worth it, unless the female applicant has some really impressive resume (they don't, since high level women don't apply to small companies like mine)."
All these percentages and polls ignore one key point.  How many men change their behavior by not dating women at all?  I didn't see that item addressed in discussion
"It is a shame that this story did not talk about men who have chosen to be single. In stories on dating, they always seem to leave this statistic out of the conversation and if they do talk about it, they put men down in all negative ways who choose this way of life. And what's also amazing is the lady spoke about Millennials, but never once spoke about the madness that is really going on like them being responsible for the ""hook-up culture"" because of dating apps and the madness that ensues as a result of them. Thank God I am a Gen-Xer and didn't have to go through any of this. And I am also single by choice and I love every single minute of it."
This is excellent advice for women. Hear that ladies? Wait until at least your mid 30s before you even consider marriage. Because there's nothing that men love more than older women who have had multiple sexual partners. I just can't figure out why marriage rates are at an all time low. Hmmmmmü§î
"Instead of ""CBS"" you should just call yourself ""BS."""
"It's not worth the risk ,MGTOW"
I refuse to work with a woman. I'm happily married with no need to have interaction. Don't create the opportunity for a false allegation.
"Well, it also STOPPED thousands of conversations between men and women."
Now people know why men are going their own way
"As a rule usually guys have made the first move when approaching, but these days if you so much as look in the direction of a woman who doesn't find you appealing then you are accused of creeping or being a pervert.
You only have to look at Joey Swolls channel to see the number of videos where guys are doing nothing at all getting posted and tagged as creeps.
So of course going forward guys as a way of self preservation are not approaching it's absolutely logical this is happening."
"I did the math on this a few days ago, based on stats avail at Family Law firms dealing in divorce. The pool of actual decent, non-litigeous women, who won‚Äôt divorce you and make you a single-dad---about 10-15%. I only seriously date conservative women with traditional values. Liberal and professional women are avoided wholesale. You‚Äôre independent? Congrats. You‚Äôve successfully taught me that you‚Äôre adept at going it alone. Have a. good life. I can‚Äôt tell you how many women I‚Äôve been hit up on Match who are in their 40s who thought they wanted the kid and career. The result, a kid raised by daycare, and a selfish narcissistic women with no concept of making a real relationship works past the point of when things move out of the honeymoon phase and simply become ‚Äúlife‚Äù. An entire generation, maybe two, has been ruined because of Feminism. These women will openly mock stay-at-home mothers and home-makers."
Women get upset when men approach them but are too scared to approach men. Can you say falling fertility rate? A society with this dysfunction will be out competed by other societies in population growth.
Just got back from the future...... where women of the future absolutely HATE todays women for RUINING it!
"You can either love women or you can understand them, but not both."
"So You're Asking a woman about man's issues?

Companies should maybe stop hiring woman to safe their male employees from this problem
"Well congrats feminists

You‚Äôve ended human interaction entirely :)"
"Embrace mgtow , avoid women and live a long happy life"
You asked for this ladies you get it.
Mgtow!
"The fact is, the last thing this country needs is MORE PEOPLE.   Just think about all the person vs. person stuff that happens EVERY DAY:
- competing for a parking spot
- competing to merge on the freeway
- competing to get hired
- competing to get into a good school
- competing to get into a good major
- competing for promotion


There are TOO MANY FREAKING PEOPLE.  We start getting on each other's nerves when everything is crowded.


So the end of dating, which happened in large part in the past 10 to 15 years, is probably a good thing long term.


Ask yourself this.  Does either gender care too much about being faithful in a relationship?  Of course not.  Very few people in our times do.  Now you can say ""that's bad"" but you have to roll with reality.


Stop pursuing relationships.  Getting married today is like what 'going steady' was, just that easy to end it.  There are NO SOCIAL NORMS to keep people together, and there is NO SOCIAL STIGMA to dumping a significant other just because you felt 'it was time.'


You might think 'that's true but it's bad'  well remember,  you can't change it, it is our society now.
The WORST thing you can do as a man is be a 'wallet' for some girl who just because she has 'maternal instincts' and wants to have children. 



Maternal instincts are not YOUR problem.  They are HER problem, remember that. 



The LAST thing our society needs right now is MORE PEOPLE.   Having sex is normal, expected, healthy but do NOT GET MARRIED and start popping out kids, we don't need them.  Look at all those homeless!   TOO MANY PEOPLE NOW.
.

The only thing is you have to do is just walk away and don't concern yourself with keep it moving
MGTOW REDPILL PROTECT YOURSELF.
I love my freedom . No need women üëé. Thanks Metoo you liberated us .
By change their behaviour they mean they are saying FO to dating. I do not want anyone to approach me and my workplace is definitely not changing. Ambitious but without any talent in my experience.
"Yeh, they avoid women."
Why do they keep showing white guys with black women? CBS loves that.
"The fact that we're even polling ourselves about courtship shows that there is no rudimentary trust between the sexes, because ettiquette and sensibilty don't exist anymore."
#MeToo has indeed affected how single men behave: By going #MGTOW
How were they acting?
"Why all the downvotes? ....it‚Äôs true. Men are always pressure to ‚Äúmake a move‚Äù on the first few dates. Ok how about women make the first moves..but they don‚Äôt then blame the guy for not making a move etc. women gotta step up if you want equality, start making the moves."
#mgtow brothers
No dating for me.  üò®
"You're right, men will no longer council woman alone in fear of being accused of sexual assault."
"So basically men change their behavior out of necessity because of women, women most affected."
"ONLY A F'N FEMINIST:  ""They're more reserved. They are being more careful. Making sure their jokes are appropriate and have the right kinds of conversation.""  WTF, Lady!  We sound like our guard is up and we are dancing for approval.  She said this and never thought that's not a solution. What it sounds like...the backstory of how men became wary and resentful of women."
Millennials are ambitious?  Well there goes her credibility.  Most of them aren't even in a hurry to get a drivers license.
"Mostly women run for money not for men, rich guys with 6 foot handsome attract her, but responsible and nice men who can feed a family don't importance. Run for money, girl will run for you, have a self respect"
"oh boy, just wait 10 more years and the growth of single cat ladies will skyrocket"
MGTOW IS THE WAY
she has no clue about dating and the biological clock of women and statistics on the longer they go the less likely they will marry and have children.   She also forgot about domestic courts and men are thinking the juice isnt worth the squeeze.  liability risk is to great.
"I‚Äôd vote for Rose McGowan as Republican or Independent. I agree with her on many things, but their are definitely a few things that I‚Äôd want to hear her fews on before voting. Still I hope she does. I think a lot of people would agree.üå∫üôèüèºüíï"
Don‚Äôt ever give into bartering with your body ! But some find it easy going ? Today there‚Äôs no reason for any victims not to record this abuse! Be strong enough to walk out !
"""I think MEN should feel safe figuring out if they did something wrong"". It's about man hating not sexual harassment. She only attacks men and now they can't hide the fact that women do it too."
Everything changed from the me too movement. I have changed. Many people are seeing clearer and waking up to systemic sexism existing. It was a huge catalyst and the affects of it cannot be measured. Change cannot happen overnight.
"Any reporting on Keith Ellison? poundmetoo, er, I mean, hashtagmetoo."
right now is about justice and truth and how we treat humans. who will be TRUTH HERO about this that care about JUSTICE and humanlity this side will be the GOOD guys side this good people side where are you u need to stand up
To measure change or success try focusing upon reports of recent incidents. How many? What kind? Are people speaking out more? Are predators more cautious? Focusing on historical occurrences is now a lesser part of the story.
"YES! me too smashed Hollywood the workplace trust, and the flirting.
what next feminism.... destroy the future hope of Boys ?.... oh! you already did that."
"how about a movement that could actually save all of humanity?? 
#WORKFORFREE 
please ask me how we can do this!!! I will tell you. and everyone would have a job!!!"
Both my ex wife and my brother's ex wife accused us of beating them during divorce.  Neither one of us hit a woman in our lives.  Women bearing false witness against men is widespread.
"This is right.  HR is there to protect the company, no one else."
It works well if you want to get someone fired
"I disagree.  Immediately after Anita Hill made 'Sexual Harassment"" an everday term, I had two co-workers called in to respond to mere allegations.
Both were fired within ten minutes.
Sounds like HR did a great job for the accusers."
"How serious should someone with a book about ""Witches"" be taken?"

Getting in trouble for keeping distance from women is Far better than getting in trouble for sexual harassment
"I rather not be in the 2%,so don't fault me being extra careful."
One of the craziest ways to have your life ruined is by having a female colleague show interest in you and then you decline out of being professional. They really don't take rejection well.
"their empathy for what amounts to mental health issue for the men is amazing. Men feeling stressed, and fear in the work place, and they could not care less. overwhelming number of workplace suicide are men, and their advice is just get over it."
I love how the misandrist just lets her toxic femininity breathe. Men getting falsely accused of sexual assault are literally by all over the place. But hey it's so small and negligible meaning it doesn't exist whatsoever.
Let's say there were a bowl of M&Ms and I told you that only 2% were poisoned. Would you eat any?
#metoo has been the greatest recruiting tool for MGTOW.
"Well she failed to mention that sexual harassments claims are almost always entirely  based on testimony.  Meaning that regardless of guilt, the accusation is more than enough to result in dire life ruining consequences for the accused.  Funny this lady precludes that fact from her argument.  Thus, mens refusal to be alone with women under any circumstances is a very rational and pragmatic response to the current situation."
"It's not about false accusations. It's about ""he flirted with me once now i will ruin his life""."
Feminists have proven they can be dentrimental to men‚Äôs jobs and well being.
"So the 2% is supposed to mean, ""Don't worry - if you're accused, there's a 98% chance you're guilty and your career is over."" We should all feel better now."
If a man is in a room with a woman for a few hours working and afterwards she accuses you of harassment let's say because of a misunderstanding or her lying the guy is done for. He did nothing but just the accusation will destroy him
To claim 2% is an outright lie. Sexual harassment is the one crime where the accuser is also judge and jury.
"My chances of dying in a car crash are less than .02%, but I still wear a seat belt."
"Never take advice from a woman about how to act around other women. 
Just avoid them all."
2%?!    GTFOH
If your in the 2% innocent collom it can destroy your life so yeah it's not as easy as it sounds.
I love how feminists sit there and claim that they are trying to help everyone when all of the policy they create so clearly favors women.
"my brother who works in a small IT company in NC told me he is having trouble finding a gf, so I told why not ask one of your coworkers out, and he told me he would never do that because one of his male coworkers asked a female coworker out, she causally told him that she is not interested and he replied ok and never talked about that again, a week later he receives a mail from hr that he is being fired for making sexual advances at workplace... ofcourse men are terrified of women, that guy drives for doordash now as he was unable to find work anywhere else"
"Wow, men are afraid of being falsely accused and you people say they are panicking, should learn how to behave and that they are committing a crime.
Jesus, what a way to make things worse."
"You can't force male managers to mentor female employees  and it isn't discrimination to use the mike pence rule
God bless Mike pence and Billy Graham"
Save yourself. Play it safe and don't even tempt fate by being alone with a woman you work with.
"I'm an employer of my (and another person's) company, and we both specifically avoid hiring women for numerous reasons, one of them being the false accusations of sexual harassments.  Yes, we accept applications from women due to legal reasons, but we haven't hired even one female employee in the 11 years the company ran.  It's just not worth it, unless the female applicant has some really impressive resume (they don't, since high level women don't apply to small companies like mine)."
2% naaaaa more 99.9 % when shes in her period of false accusation
The problem with citing FBI data is that it keeps track of accusations which go through the legal system. They aren't keeping track of false statements in HR complaints.
Your statistics are extremely questionable.
2% is just the ones where the guy could prove his innocence. What about the false accusations where the man couldn‚Äôt prove his innocence? It‚Äôs definitely higher than 2%.
"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice  ...."
I have a bowl with 100 skittles. 2 are poisoned. Would you eat the whole bowl? Nope. Not a chance.
"Love the shaming language Wymyn insist on using. Man ""scared"". No actually Men are SMART for avoiding them."
Notice that they are not citing any law against refusing to be friendly to women colleagues?
"It‚Äôs the fact that man don‚Äôt want their behavior to be taken as flirting or harassment simply by talking to you how they would talk to any other friend, it seems like a lot of women especially in todays society feel men are always trying to ‚Äúget with them‚Äù but that‚Äôs not always the case. Also if something was to happen and she falsely accused you it‚Äôs her word against yours and NOBODY is believing what you say over a women especially now so men just avoid interaction altogether."
According to these two it's once again Men's fault. Way to go blaming men for every problem.
"Most men wouldn‚Äôt even speak to a woman at work, let alone ask them out. I‚Äôd rather be single and keep my job than get #MeToo‚Äôd."
That's the proof that woman really think that nothing is ever their fault ü§£
"As an outsider and having seen how the FBI at work the past four years.  I would only trust them to give me the correct time, twice a day, with a broken clock!"
I want a law that gives men the right to wear a body cam at work or to force employers to install video and audio recordin equipment in every work space except the bathroom obviously.
Men are afraid that they are going to be falsely accused of inappropriate behavior after women falsely accuse men of inappropriate behavior? I'm SHOCKED! SHOCKED I say!
"suing a man for rapr after 5+years should not br allowed if the ""victim"" was an ADULT when it happened."
So the best solution is have companies with only females and companies with only males and let see which company can last more than 1 week
"Okay, say I'm a man, now you are telling me that almost all accusations of sexual impropriety against men are true (98%)
So I should have no reason to worry about interacting with women, after all, why would any woman want to hurt me?
This is truly chilling."
"wow... just wow...
people are worried. and we should blame them for being worried eh?"
"This video is beyond stupid. They completely missed the mark here. Good job guys! 
üòÇüëèüëèüëèüòê
Just wow."
If you are a woman or a man who wants a relationship with somebody from work you already know instead of dating strangers you don't know you are out of luck because trying in even the vaguest of ways is prohibited.
The point is that 2% of false allegations is very high. You do not want to be the one guy that has to deal with the 50th woman that has the power to destroy your life. You‚Äôll be guilty until you can prove to be innocent. You cannot defend yourself and be fired. Stay safe. Never have meetings with only one woman. Always have witnesses.
Mgtow shield wall is up
Why do Women need to be mentored by Men Where are the feminists
"That woman just lied.  False Sexual assault claims may be at 2%,;  but sexual assault and sexual harassment are not the same thing.  Women claim ANYTHING as harassment..."
Feminists the greatest recruiting tool for MGTOW.
"Can someone explain why so many people disliked this?

Edit: Maybe because these people are undermining the power of women who can easily use this power to blackmail men or ruin their life?"
"Keep them away from me.

#NOTME"
Men keep protecting your self.  Cameras / witnesses
This is completely not true because as a 15 year old I was accused and it broke my world and how I saw it and as a male this is one of the many things why I have trust issues at a young age.
"You're very hungry and handed a bag of 50 peanuts but told there is one peanut in there (2%) that has a neurotoxin which can make you violently ill or leave you paralyzed - are you going take a chance and eat some? Not likely.  That's what men face with interacting with women in the work place - it's not about being "" afraid "" it's about taking sensible precautions to safeguard their jobs and reputation."
"I just don't want to be in the 2% , is that too hard to accept?"
It is their choices whether men will mentor women or not. You can't say that this is crime or violation. All women betray men when their needs are fulfilled by men like mentoring.
One false accusation is one false accusation too many.
2:02 - men are even get punished now for being afraid. This woman is insane.
"I don't think men and women are made to work together. Traditionally, men worked with men and vice versa. Go to the oilfield and it's all men and there are never many issues. As a maintenance technician at a hotel, I found that the dynamic with so many women around became a problem for me with advances, drama and jealousy. This led me to seek jobs far away from an office. I prefer working with men only or solo as the drama is almost nothing. No need to tip toe around people's insecurities or feelings in those environments. Risk of getting into legal trouble is almost nothing as well."
"what is the benefit of mentoring a woman for me , compared to the risk ?"
she is more threatening calling out laws and forbidding men to say no...
"Sure, I trust the FBI, just about as much as I trust NBC.........so long."
Nope! We are tired of being accused and having lives ruined over baseless accusations.
Male managers should not have 1-1s with women PERIOD.
"I know this will happen, all men should be respectful and careful."
She said only 2% - the fear is being in that 2%
"for the sake of argument, even if there are only 2% false allegations, that 1 in 50 chance will nuke a guy's career and forever smear his reputation. you would never jump out of an airplane if there was a 1 in 50 possibility the parachute would not open."
"Anyone who doesn't take steps to mitigate risk is just asking for trouble. If you let your guard down and make any sort of a comment  outside the strict bounds of work related topics it will come back to harm you eventually. Women hold grudges, they look for lapses, they look for anything that might serve as a weapon they can use maybe not today but when it works to their best advantage.  Do not take a meeting one on one with a woman. Never close the door when meeting with a woman. Never travel with a woman. Never dine alone with a woman. Dating is dating and work is work. Never confuse the two or assume that a woman can be trusted not to screw you over if it advances her interests. Personal experience talking here."
The Bret Cavanaugh case minimized the #metoo movement!
"(Sigh) Being lectured again!!? Ladies, this is what you wanted, you caused the damage, can't change your minds now. Oh, and by the way, 2% false accusations is way off, the number of false accusations is much much higher. Also, notice the subtle threat of it being ""illegal"" to avoid women in the workplace. Gawd!! They just won't stop!!"
"My employer refuses to hire female employees.
I love working in this environment"
so fear is illegal now? we know that any accusation will be unconditionally believed and your life will be destroyed.
"Ok. I've been hearing alot about the work environment. But what I haven't heard about is the damage in every other area of life. And I have only heard about ""white males in power."" But what about your average middle class men who do have moral compasses who have been taught to respect women but they fear that one mistake and they'll be stripped of everything? You can't be so laser focused on a crusade that you don't pay attention to who gets hurt in the process. And don't even get me started on the dilemmas that BLACK men face. Me Too has done many good, and I support women demanding to be put on the same platform. But the the movement has single-categorized everybody. There is a difference between those that feel they're entitled, invincible, & untouchable and those that are human beings and have errors. They shouldn't suffer. We can't overlook the damages that Me Too caused."
"How's this fair, women basically pointing a weapon to men's head do whatever I say and when we try to avoid you, you try to get us in trouble pulling us into your issues.
Lose lose situation how is that fair?"
2% its really 90%
A simple gaze can make her 'uncomfortable'....and make you lose your job
I'm not afraid to work with women because Im unprofessional. I am afraid because the accusation is all it takes.
"Nate Parker of ""Birth of a nation"" was a man that was vindicated 15 years before the movie came out. He was found not guilty and proven innocent. So interesting that that case was brought up right before the release of birth of a nation just as his career was jump starting. They wanted him to apologize or have sympathy for the victim that falsely accused him. He did not have to show remorse for something that was traumatizing for him and almost destroyed him. The end result? He no longer in Hollywood. No studio will touch him. Stay away from women in the work place."
"Organization isn't going to help men, when someone falsely accused..."
"Tell me, cultural historian Lynn Parramore or company leader Gene Marks, or anyone else who made the claims in this video: If I, as a man, lose my job and my ability to get future jobs because my reputation is shot by a false report of sexual harassment - one which *will* destroy my reputation, for sure - will you be able to offer me a job? Or support me through any legal trial that takes place, at least monetarily? Work to help clear me of such false accusations? Or will you just wash your hands and say, ""F it, he's just one of the 2% who got nicked and let the courts decide if he's guilty""?

Heck, do you even walk the talk you make? Because, beyond the facts and figures, our lives are on the line here."
"21000 views, 118 likes, now you know the dislike count. And by the way 2% of 1 billion is 20 million."
"Know what else is illegal? Making a false accusation. Didn't stop these harridans, now did it?"
It‚Äôs not backlash it‚Äôs self preservation ya women did it to yourselves.
"‚ÄúBreaking the law.‚Äù?

Seriously, GFY."
"Interact with women in your workplaces only when needed. Otherwise you're better off avoiding them. After work, don't even think about hanging out. If you need to work late, make sure a camera is recording. You'll thank me later."
"A false accusation doesn't need to be taken to court have you ever dealt with a crazy ex? You all talking nonsense.  

They aren't refusing because they are women, they are refusing because of potential lawsuits even when innocent."
Is fear a punishable offence?
Anytime there's music in the background..........you know you're being lied to
Has to be higher than 2% false claims - I know several and they were all false
"Did all men hear that? Its illegal to avoid women. Any tickets left for flight to Mars, I'm going home."
"""There is a clear line"" proceeds not to talk about where this line is precisley. And  feminist won't ever define it because that would mean there would be gender roles."
Yeah lady?  What about mens safety at the workplace?
2% of false accusations does not look that bad until you fall in that category
"2% of false r*pe accusations is already too much . a friend of mine got falsely accused of that years ago. it has traumatized him to this day . i don't like the way this woman is downplaying it , not to mention the veiled threat against already anxious people that they may face the law . my advice , when you start your company , pick in advance your entire staff , this way you cannot be blackmailed to hire anyone you don't want to hire /"
How is this video still up on YouTube and not been deleted
My second solution is... Panoramic Body Cameras and microphones all over the body and cameras and microphones everywhere.
Better to break the law in one fashion; you can justify that in the post-MeToo world. But never let a woman break the law with a false accusation and have your career and reputation be broken.
"5 years ago in my early 20s I would have loved to hire women. 

Now in my late 20s I would never. Never. Ain‚Äôt that funny?"
I don't even look at woman anymore.  Lately there's nothing much too look at and nothing upstairs either.  I rather ignore  this little group all together.
2% x 15.  I almost got fired for not doing an extra work for one of my female co worker.
One question. What do you want to do about it beside whine?

"With little notice, President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order that advocates say rolls back hard-fought victories for women in the workplace. Tuesday's ""Equal Pay Day"" ‚Äî which highlights the wage disparity between men and women ‚Äî is the perfect time to draw more attention to the president's action, activists say. On March 27, Trump revoked the 2014 Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order then-President Barack Obama put in place to ensure that companies with federal contracts comply with 14 labor and civil rights laws. The Fair Pay order was put in place after a 2010 Government Accountability Office investigation showed that companies with rampant violations were being awarded millions in federal contracts. In an attempt to keep the worst violators from receiving taxpayer dollars, the Fair Pay order included two rules that impacted women workers: paycheck transparency and a ban on forced arbitration clauses for sexual harassment, sexual assault or discrimination claims. Noreen Farrell, director of the anti-sex discrimination law firm Equal Rights Advocates, said Trump went ""on the attack against workers and taxpayers."" ""We have an executive order that essentially forces women to pay to keep companies in business that discrimination against them, with their own tax dollars,"" said Farrell. ""It's an outrage."" Out of the 50 worst wage theft violators that GAO examined between 2005-2009, 60 percent had been awarded federal contracts after being penalized by the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division. Similar violation rates were tracked through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Labor Relations Board. Now isn't that order very consistent with the sexual criminal confessions we all heard not once. but on two separate occasions during the Axis Hollywood bus. previous to that during his interview with Howard Stern. Former prosecutor Gov. FBI director Giuliani. Said those audiotaped criminal confessions were nothing more than locker room talk. Not according to criminal psychologist brain specialist those audiotaped criminal confessions were much more consistent with a jailhouse confession from one inmate to another. Or a prison reminiscence from one convict to another who are living out there sentencing in protective custody, for sexual crimes are classified as the weakest form of criminal conduct. Not to mention any other prosecutor in the country would take two audiotaped criminal confessions as enough evidence to prosecute. And then when you have 14 witnesses come forward and validate everything that was on those audiotaped criminal confessions.Would be enough evidence to convince any judge of a conviction. Well any judge except for that desperate week insecure impulsive poor specimen of a female judge that goes on and on about how great it is being a submissive trumpet blower. And you wonder why America has the highest violent crime rate in the world. You wonder why America has the highest drug addiction alcohol dependency in the world. And you wonder why America has the most overfed undernourished people in existence. is not all gloom and doom. We can deal with this situation. As a people as physically fit mentally sound and spiritually balanced Americans. At the same time we are dealing with the situation in life. Subconsciously spiritually there souls and spirits are being implemented with, all the pain suffering disease sickness illness torment and hunger that has been allowed to occur over the years manifesting into what it is today. Thanks to incompetent lazy ignorant reckless negligent vindictive criminal leaders supporters employees employers. And now going to get far worse if Donald Trump his submissive trumpet blowers desperately impulsive employees have their way. Now let us thank our heavenly father for allowing Ronald Reagan Donald Trump supporters followers employees like-minded people for subconsciously: coherently apparently volunteering their soul and spirit to function similar to an air purifier water filtration system steam cleaner rubber gloves sponge shield bedpan urinal ass wipes blowup doll. But plug tampon maxi pad diaper jump rope ankle weights wrist weights weighted vest punching bag so forth and so on. Etc. etc. and that is the short list of how their souls and spirits are being treated. Before we get into how their souls and spirits are going to be implemented with all the pain suffering disease sickness illness torment and hunger that has occurred over the years manifesting into what it is today. Keep in mind my submissive trumpet blowers the soul and spirit can endour one up to  billions of years worth of pain suffering disease sickness illness torment and hunger .that is just a sample Of the miraculous power of spirituality eternal authority that exist beyond your comprehension for your life cannot commonly comprehend things past your life's expectancy. Now I wish and pray for my soul and spirit to be held spiritually accountable to the statements I proclaim. I guarantee you will never hear another body leader person of legal authority ever validate the statements they proclaim with that level of certainty. If the sun the father the Holy Spirit God the devil Lord Jesus or anyone else with true eternal power and authority over life and death. Felt differently about the statements on proclaiming the had four separate opportunities to keep me dead and silent. The bottom line is you're either part of the problem are part of the solution when it comes to equality between a man and a woman as well as respecting another persons physical freedom. See a dominant gentleman knows how to intelligently persuade passionately convincing a woman to have the desire to willingly want to share themselves romantically. your part of the problem are solution. Either way your being held spiritually accountable. One way comes with a pleasant form of rehabilitation physically mentally spiritually. And the other way is the opposite of the first way. Again I wish and pray for my soul and spirit to be held spiritually accountable to the statements I proclaim. I guarantee you will never hear another body leader person of legal authority ever validate the statements they proclaim with that level of certainty. One reason they don't know themselves therefore they have NO respect for themselves and can't respect others. Secondly is because they are not willing to hold themselves accountable to the way they live their life to the laws the put in place. For the laws they put in place will greatly influence whether you live and die Feeling accomplished being at peace. The bottom line is Donald Trump has been clinically diagnosed by criminal psychologist brain specialist! Leading physicians As being physically and mentally submissive! To fill that massive void a weakness) His plan to stay on the top! Is by keeping the bottom sick week desperate hungry and malnourished and poor by recirculating dirty low-paying jobs that come from outdated power sources inferior materials and toxic substances. That have lived out there usefulness for they have been classified scientifically as petrified death! More commonly known as coal oil and gas dirtiest of all sand oil. Along with other toxic chemicals that never changed their killing composition. You cannot promote life by using a substance that diminishes the quality of our air water food and landscapes. Dirty low-paying jobs very few at that however will have a negative effect on hundreds of millions for only God knows how many generations dirty low-paying jobs that diminish the quality of our air water food and landscapes with the potential of causing environmental collapse there is no profit to be made in the demise of the planet businessman my ass! Just look at the BP oil spill. The man-made water crisis situation in Flint Michigan. The man-made water crisis situation at the military base known as Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The fly ash spill that occurred from Duke Power in North Carolina. Those are a few examples. . . Of the irreversible damage that comes from working with outdated power sources inferior materials toxic substances. That have been scientifically classified spiritually validated as being physically mentally useless therefore have no true value spiritually. Now a dominant gentleman or lady that knows how to demonstrate high-class sophistication which is femininity at its finest!! for it is raw wild naturally hard-core organically appealing truly captivating absolutely eternally spiritually sought after by the gods and goddesses of the ancient royalty, warrior elite...... knows the best way to stay on the top is by keeping the bottom confidently rising in the most efficient way that is humanly possible, allowing each generation to become stronger smarter healthier happier financially better off. For that possibility of a reality to come full circle. The people must have clean high-paying jobs that used new technology.

"If these women wanted a form of support.. they could just make videos with achievements and actions and happy music at how a support could help them, instead of another ""victimized"" video."
"The disgusting insensitive comments just proves their point that people like y‚Äôall in the comments couldn‚Äôt care less about them and their experience, I swear these comments are sickening"
"That‚Äôs right, I haven‚Äôt really heard any yapping recently from these little ladies. I guess women aren‚Äôt getting jacked up anymore, eh? Or are they waiting for the most politically advantageous time to start the machine up again?"
"People just project their own feelings onto others. I'd have no problem voting for a woman, trans person, physically disabled person ECT. I care about your policies not how you look."
"Lol, David's follow up questions are the best, and most callers blank out and just can't answer"
"I love how this guy totally crumples when simply asked to back up his claim.  David was really if anything a little too gentle with his pushback, and the guy couldn't even handle that.  I hope he reconsiders his position."
What even was that? The guy didn't have any examples of his claims. It just seemed like he had a problem with the me too movement and needed to vent about that and used the excuse of women candidates not doing well in the polls to do so.
"If he didn‚Äôt want David to say a word, he should have left a voicemail, and then he‚Äôd not have been challenged. It seems that that‚Äôs how he‚Äôd prefer to be treated. Just a tip for ‚Äútotal control,‚Äù for the next narrative he‚Äôs ‚Äúcrafting.‚Äù"
Sounds like someone doesn't like the idea of women being able to tell on their abusers and those abusers having to face consequences. He wants TOTAL CONTROL over the narative.
David was asking for the literal name of someone who was unjustly affected by the me too movement while the caller thought he was asking for an example of an aspect of the movement that he disagrees with. This guy had to be kind of drunk to misunderstand a direct question so clear and simple.
This totally guy seems like a manipulative creep
"Wait - - the caller thinks David ""isn't happy"" with ""the narrative"" that the caller ""crafted""? 

I don't know how anybody could be happy with whatever that bizarre narrative was, and which the caller himself was clearly not able to explain..."
The guy thinks successful men should get away with abusing women..
Total control has some serious mommy problems.
totalcontrol871 sounds like he resents not having it any longer
Lol he‚Äôs just mad cause he got called out for harassing some girl
"An beautiful advise to caller: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been hearing a lot of bad shit, frankly, and in many cases it‚Äôs like, wow, I‚Äôve known some of these women and I‚Äôve known stories like this for years and they said nothing to me. What is wrong with me? What have I, how have I presented myself in such a way as to not give confidence, or why was I not the sort of person people would see as a natural ally here? So I started looking at that.‚Äù Anthony Bourdain."
Total Control does not like being questioned on his view.
"Speaking as a woman, my (guess) at what ""Total"" was trying to say, is that this movement, as with anything else, should be taken on a case-by-case basis.  Many of these things have happened to many girls and women.  Also, and unfortunately, there are some women who were (not) victimized,  who will lie, and get money and/or revenge on exes, etc.  Sadly, those women only complicate things for true victims of all manners of harassment.

I could be wrong about the caller's point, however.

Let's not blame victims for speaking up!  Many victims have (rightfully) been afraid of retaliation.  

I'm glad the silence is broken."

"Never make a statement you cannot back with proof via an example, known fact or research. Otherwise it just becomes a personal opinion. The GOP does that. We can be better than this."
"The caller is 100% right. The problem with the callerwas not having an example of this power when in reality there are dozens of them. 

Here's few. Gian Gomeshi, Vic Mignona(formerly of Funimation) Cuba Gooding Jr. and many more men have had to go through a lot of nonsense based off of FALSE allegations. Caller should've came in more prepared."

I think regular people have largely forgotten the Me Too movement.

I can't wait for Al Franken to come back and for Harvey Weinstein to go away LOL
"I can name two instances where ""me too"" seemed (from an outside perspective) to ensnare two men where the repercussions seemed to far outweigh the allegation of misconduct: Senator Al Franken and Garrison Keeler from Lake Wobegon program.  In my mind they both seem to unfairly maligned and caught up in the fervor of a cultural moment. I think Garrison Keillor had his hand on a woman's back during a photograph, and from my outside perspective, Al Franken's photographic prank was when he was a comedian many years earlier and did not warrant his resignation from the Senate in which he was highly regarded by all of his female staff (according to accounts). But, me too represents a cultural shift and anytime there is a cultural shift, there's going to be some backlash. And it is that backlash which may be hurting some high profile female politicians as a result in the short-term."
"I loved how you asked for an example and he just went totally speechless bahaha

He DIDNT have any examples, he just feels threatened"
I'd say Chris Hardwick was the victim of a crazed ex gf using me too as a weapon.
"Women need to believe that they do not deserve harrassment and abuse. For too long we have brushed our feelings and fear aside because we felt we had to. We still face an uphill battle in many areas. I work a Management position. I am expected to dress the same as my Male counterparts but also do my hair and wear makeup. I have to literally dress like a Man, why wear makeup? I have faced workplace discrimination but never spoke up because I didn't want to be ""that Woman"". Me too opened a dialogue and hopefully will make Men think twice before they act inappropriately. I have never asked for special treatment. Only the opportunity to do my job well and be noticed for my hard work. No favors, no quid pro quo."
"How does someone call in like that and make a blanket statement they can‚Äôt defend. Al Franken, Louis CK. There are examples where ‚Äúme too‚Äù crucified people for simply bad behavior"
"The caller is the equivalent of an ""I'm not racist but......"" person. Perfect example of a rise in equity turning some men off."
That dude has control and anger issues coming out the wazoo.
"This guy is right, women got carried away with the power they got from ruining men‚Äôs lives based on false accusations. You can only tell so many lies before utterly destroying your representation."
"The man doesn't have an example, so he's got nothing."
"Al Franken is the perfect example of this. There just happens to be a new claim from a Dem staffer on the morning Time magazine revealed it's person of the year was the women of the ""Me Too"" movement. Then Gillibrand and Harris just happen to have statements ready to call for Franken's resignation. It was all way too contrived."
Power-drunk?!! Calling out men for their irresponsible abuse of power is being power-drunk?
I will give you an example: the comedian that had his career ruined by a woman who had a bad date and then accused him of sexual assault. Makes the rest of us men nervous that it could happen to us.
"Insane,  absolutely insane."
Comments saying David's been doing something with Jordan Peterson and he needs to explain himself. What's that about?
Pakman is the best at handling these types of people
Citation needed....this video has not David.
"The caller brought up an interesting point that should be explored, but instead was summarily dismissed. This manic PC culture now prevents people to even consider the possibility that a movement like ""me too"" can go too far. By the way, if you want an example of someone being prosecuted in the court of public opinion based on accusation alone, Brett Kavanaugh is a perfect example."
"""can you give examples of your claim?""
""WELL OBVIOUSLY YOU JUST DON'T LIKE MY CLAIM SO I'LL MOVE ON IT'S OK YOU'RE JUST NOT THINKING"""
"A man criticizing the me too movement?

"I love when David responds to these kinds of ""we all know it happens"" type claims with a request for an example because they never have one."

"David, you have the potential to easily have 4-5 million subscribers. You are the same personality type as Andrew Yang, but he has shored up his weaknesses in EQ and social intelligence. You are an intellectual giant, but without balancing out your innate weaknesses, you are holding yourself back. You are right at that age where INTJs tend to clue in to their weaknesses and everything gets better. Especially your most valued intuition (it goes through the roof) and personal relationships. I am the same type and I have learned a lot from Yang. You could learn a lot from him too."
aziz ansiri is a good example ???
He's probably hoping his past doesn't come back to bite him. Don't be a perv
"That's why as a dude, i want nothing to do with feminism"
"To all the people in the comments here, what the caller is talking about is the fact that women have in more recent times been falsely accusing men for rape, sexual harassment, and sexual misconduct while getting away with it. For so long, we generally have viewed women as these poor innocent creatures that can't do no wrong and that men are generally the bad people. I myself believed that and I'm a man. However, after having a former friend of mine turn on me and accused me of being too pushy on her, even though she one night snuck on to me and took a picture of herself laying on top of me without my concent , I've had a different view on these cases of rape that pop up now. Now, after witnessing how a woman can turn on me in the blink of an eye, leaving me confused about what I've done, and then lie about it to others, I no longer can fully belive these women when they make these claims. One thing we seem to not understand is that women can be just as manipulative as men to get their way. In fact, it's arguably easier for them since women for the most part are more emotional then men. At least, I know from my experience that that's the case. I as a man don't have a lot of emotions. Hell, it's very hard for me to cry. I didn't even cry when my grandparents died.

The point is that the ME Too movement has eccentuated women to do what ever it takes to get their way; even if it means lying to the point that it ruins a man's life. And with how we're inclined to instantly believe what a woman says without hesitation, that's how some women out there have become powere hungry. Remember, there have been a lot of horrible men through out history, but there can be despicable women too. Never assume one gender is completely innocent."
I'm glad this guy is the authority on how to wield power...
"I kind of agree with the caller. I wonder if some of the men who lost their jobs because of the Me Too movement (for example, Tavis Smiley) really deserved it, and I think some women (for example, Yvette Vega) haven't really paid a price for their complicity.

Don't get me wrong, I think the Me Too movement is _mostly_ a good thing, but I don't support everything that has happened."
This guy's talking point is so 2017.
This made zero sense
"Okay I feel like nobody was actually listening to his argument. He's actually pretty correct here. A large portion of insecure male voters have been wronged in their personal lives and are more afraid than is probably justified. There are far fewer cases of public rape and sexual assault allegations proven false than there are those confirmed or unconfirmed, but it is quite palpable seeing innocent men lose their jobs and credibility because of a consensual drunken night out with women they couldn't trust.

Overall, I think it doesn't impact my voting habits one bit. I would not vote for a candidate based on identity, but much of the country is a lot more tribal than that. They would definitely project valid fears in their personal lives into insecure and unjustifiable fears about voting for a woman.

And David was being intentionally stubborn in his manner of speaking with this man, probably pressed for time, but there are many cases of known male public figures like Al Franken or Aziz Ansari, or even drummed up allegations like Louis C.K. which resulted in flooring people's livelihood and respect based on private issues where less wrong was done than was portrayed.

The fear is valid and shouldn't be dismissed. SOME activists and women in the Twitter mob have definitely hurt their cause, and no, that does not validate not voting for Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris on the basis of sex.

Alright done with my ramble."
When you realize what kind of person you're talking to 2:56. Lol what a genius this guy is.
This is what happens when you wake up with Sam Harris and watch Dave Rubin discuss high level ideas.
"David, in the future, would you ever consider running for president?"
Maybe ask Kirsten Gillibrand what she thinks about this idea.
"The caller has lost ""total control"" and is still a little sore about it.ü•∫ 
And my favorite Trump nickname is, ""Trumplethinskin"". üëç"
The name says it all... Total Control... and it sounds like he resents not having it. Did he really expect a movement to police individual claims.
"While the caller is a bit snarky, he's saying that the principle of the ability to accuse someone without having to prove guilt.  Basically the simple act of accusation = a result for the impacted accused individual (in the case of Metoo typically female v male). This is what he was trying to articulate, and I may not have done a great job with my articulation either, I nonetheless understand the sentiment that it feels like if a person is going to accuse someone that they should have to prove guilt as opposed to the accused have to prove innocence."
I've been waiting for David to go full James O'Brien from LBC for a while. I need a full show of this.
"I think the caller has a point. The #MeeToo movement has in some way ""victoried itself to death""."
"Ya why couldn‚Äôt  the women just keep their mouths shut, wa wa wa"
"i think that not going through with the accusations might have caused some problem for women, but i dont know what type of problem. So many accusations against trump that ended without any resolve, but i also dont know what they could've done, since if the women were sexually assaulted they should come forward."
"The most I‚Äôd give this caller is that misogynistic voters may be more activated in reaction to #MeToo. Similar to how social gains for the LGBTQ, the growing minority-majority, and increased political power for minorites have activated reactionaries for quite some time now"
Agent orange...get it?! *GeT iT?!*
Me can't count to two
I would say an example is what happened to Al Franken.
üòÇ this call was something else.
"David while the guys opinion might be kind of stupid, it‚Äôs pretty condescending to interrupt and strawman the argument every turn. Your clarification on this bugs me."
"2:35 
Total control had a point. He gave you an example, and you overly simplified it so as to make it seem non-sensical. I dont know anything about this hair-sniffing scandal, but I wish you greased the argument's wheels further so that I could get the chance to hear a proper rebuttal from you and possibly a counter-argument from him about the topic."
"The ""Meetiya"". 

Lol."
"'In this fascinating look at the ""alpha male,"" primatologist Frans de Waal explores the privileges and costs of power while drawing surprising parallels between how humans and primates choose their leaders. His research reveals some of the unexpected capacities of alpha males -- generosity, empathy, even peacekeeping -- and sheds light on the power struggles of human politicians. ""Someone who is big and strong and intimidates and insults everyone is not necessarily an alpha male,"" de Waal says.' https://www.ted.com/talks/frans_de_waal_the_surprising_science_of_alpha_males"
"The guy is bringing up something many people like him feel. His thoughts are shared by more people one would like to believe is possible (men and women alike). They should be allowed to speak there piece since if they don't, there will be no resolution to this problem that exists. The guy wasn't prepared for the questions he was getting."
He asked him specifically many time for an example and then he spouted Flores then the caller backed off and said that's what your saying??... ?? Wtf I had to listen 3 times to try to understand what he was getting at... it's still a mystery. How many licks does it get to the center of a tootsies pop
"xXTotalControl871Xx: Women in the MeeToo movement are irresponsibly wielding their power.
David: What's an example of this happening?

"That has more to do with trial by media rather than a gender issue. Like anything else when MSM get a new thing, it becomes a force of its own. This caller was clearly a troll and a bit of a twit."
"Power hungry women.



Scary üò®"
2:44 2:56 lol üòÜ
This guy smells his own farts and doesnt make sense
I will give you the examples of Aziz Ansari and Al Franken...beyond that I cannot think of any other abuses of the Me Too movement.
What is this show anymore?
"Sorry David, i can't hear his shit.üíãüá´üá∑"
I can‚Äôt believe I was about to give this guy the benefit of the doubt (off video title alone). I agree that he definitely should have just left a voicemail. He *does* sound like a goddamn creep.
What a bust this call in was.....huh?
David:  Please be more discerning with your video postings.  Save the lame ones for the community forum.
"On the Kindle bookshelf is a pretty good book by Valerie Sparkle called Surprise Violations. It has a lot of Me, Too stories from long before the Me, Too movement finally came into being. Glad that these strong folks brought the stories into the forefront, as for so many more years, they have been going on."
all of the women like Oprah Winfrey who KNEW about Weinstein did nothing...and get no criticism...sick

Here  is the problem  with  the we too movement  kniw it will hold back women  because  know it will be harder  for women  to get promotion  or get a higher  paying jobs. Know  the work force will be run more  bumy men instead  of a qualified  woman. ...it will hurt  and hold a line that  women  will not be able  to move up the latter. Because  of this movement. ....is not good  for women. ....sorry  to tell you  the truth. ..
wart hog....
The make up  hair and clothing folks sexualized the 2 reporters. Young and thin so why not show them off.
#metoo     liberal arrogance
Finally justice!
"Hey Harv, Before you get out make sure you have a talk with the little head. The little guy has been lying to you, you know."
those women showed portrait and told this and that on him and these jurors and all believed..so rascal minded women and people here..he did legally sex..and all these medias running to them for voices...
"Jesus loves you. If you repent of your sins and give your life to Him: He will fill you with love, give you happiness in your life, and bless you. The next time that you feel sick or worried or scared, ask Jesus into your heart and your life will get better. Videos will never fill the void inside of you, but Jesus will if you give your life to Him. He will love you, keep you company, and answer your questions. He is real and a lot of the time He will speak to you through your conscience. God is love and everything good comes from Him. Everything good in the world comes from love. Romantic love, familial love, friendship, the love you feel for your hobbies, the love you have for your favorite music, favorite food, favorite movie, etc. All of it comes from God. Without love there is no point to life. It is what we all live for and it is what we were all made for, but the devil tries to ruin everything with fear, stress, worry, etc. Try to get to know God. He is truly worth worshipping."
"This is ridiculous.
So, a woman can come out and say ""Anu malik"" did this 20 years ago,
and he gets his whole career ended in a matter of seconds.

What happened to ""Innocent until proven guilty""
Where is the trial, process, and evidence.

If this continues, then any woman can just make a false accusation and ruin another man's career just like that."
Character is everything..

"Rose Mcgowan is a very, very insecure woman. I really feel so sorry for her.  She is absolutely NOT a good spokesperson for any movement. She is so tense she makes me nervous.  I hope she can get help but I doubt she will..."
For her to say we should listen to woman and hear their struggles is very ironic. She ignores that men are saying that there version of sexual assault is different to what other believe is sexual assault nd if there is no line that this issue will keep happening.
Does she offer karate lessons?
"If a guy she fancies talks to her it's flirting, if a guy she doesn't fancy or doesn't offer her a film role then it's rape."
Why did she shave her head?
I love you Rose. Stay BRAVE!

She's a 4th Dan in #MeToo Jitsu

"The me-too movement is ridiculous.¬† Of course we all condemn rape, but eliminating rape is not what the me-too movement is about.¬† The me-too movement, very much like the safe space, trigger warning politically correct movements, conflates something as serious as rape with every single gesture men make toward women that might have the slightest hint of sexuality.¬† Not only is that stupid, it smacks of power hunger and the same kind of deranged thinking that has produced the fantasy that there are as many as 135 distinct genders.¬† These are crazy people, the whole lot of them."

"Wonder why Amitabh, Akshay, Aamir, Salman, Shahrukh are avoiding this storm in the begining. They must have been directly or indirectly involved for sure..."
"I think the biggest mistake women are committing right now is trivializing their own ordeal and adding, 'nothing really happened'. It's so sad that we have been conditioned to think that apart from rape, nothing is 'big' enough to be reported. A lack of understanding of what constitutes sexual harassment has led to so many sufferers staying quiet all this time. Most of the women probably think it isn't 'big enough' to speak about and 'invite shame'. Young girls and women need to know that anyone that made you uncomfortable, made you feel small, vilified and shamed, is a sexual harasser. If I can keep my hands off men I work with or interact with, if I know that I don't need to ask them any personal questions,  why is it so hard for some of these men to understand that?"

"It's not a bollywood/film industry  problem; it's across all industries and sectors, all communities in the subcontinent. It's just that 21st century women in the entertainment industry are more proactive and brave enough to be vocal and know how to be heard and use the media as a platform to bring about a positive change by blowing the whistle on the very entitled men. They have family and friends who won't shun them. One Question remains, why are boys who then become men, brought up with so much leeway that many of them feel they can do anything. The women in their lives pamper and validate so many wrong behaviours as  'abhi chchota hai and adorable' to a point that these boys grow up and become adamant on wanting what they desire, no personal self discipline, egoistic and entitled that they can do whatever they want to whom so ever with utter disregard and disrespect.  'Pyar se samjhana' works only till some extend, after that there needs to be actual disciplinary punishment. Otherwise the kid just gets spoilt and indignant until one day the young men realize their male strength and unable to control their raging testosterone because they don't have to. Result is that you have rape, sexual harassment in families, amongst 'trusted' friends and colleagues, social communities and every workplace. The more powerful and connected rich brats now even are walking around flaying guns in publicly. What's worse that even women are equally to blame for covering and showering these individuals with affection? Beyond scolding there are no repercussions for kids who get more bold with time. All these are learnt behaviours, India needs to stop spoiling their kids especially their special precious sons who are mama papa ka raja beta. This is not normal, how can one country have brought up so many characterless, mentally faulty children who are numb to human values and respect? People at large have gone numb (which is worse than fear) or when buttons are pushed they get reactive. But for future generations and a correct respectable India, what should be a respond to secure a decent society for kids growing up now? Why are the minds so lewd, despicable and corrupt? It's not one angle, uni directional problem but it urgently needs addressing. I hope present day parents with sons and daughters both are educated and strong enough to met out tough love, so that they don't validate ego, overconfidence or vanity. Do not allow such sickness to proliferate in an otherwise beautiful country."

Such a traumatic experience
"It has suddenly given many media people something to write about or talk about. Shobha herself depends upon these celebrities. Their existence vanishes when the celebrities disappear. So, I am wondering even  all these victims want industry to break apart and disappear. So, everyone will go only upto a point otherwise fire will  scorch the ground so  bad, nothing will be left to grow the new shoots of revival on. 
It is like that storm of betting, the cricket was engulfed in when all fans were disgusted but they all wanted cricket to survive. A few players, administrators got punished. Others became circumspect, more watchful.  Now, corruption in not only cricket but also in politics is tolerated as long as it is under the radar and well hidden.
#Me-Too is a self-immolation exercise for all cinegoers. Ask them if they will stop watching the movies  with whom the guilty people were ever associated.
No, none will as it is an outlet for all to put their hairs down. So, it is good that it is happening and growing but this catharsis will not change much as who is talking about the next steps, industry must take. They are lost in individuals and their stories and that is where it will end with some people getting their vendetta and some satisfaction."

Sunjay Dutt"
"Last few weeks, I have been following up on Tanushree Dutta's interviews and statements and that like million others made me think....Why now? Why? Why after so many years?

Let me clarify a couple of things here. I am a Canadian citizen and have been living in Canada and USA since last 20 years. I have no connection with any political or social groups of India/ USA or Canada nor am I related to any important or well known person of any indian media. I am an Indian born Canadian who only has emotional bonding with India. That is all.

This whole incident's discussions made me think on this entire issue like an unbiased person as I am not a fan of anybody in this episode. I am like any other reader and observer however I think like a North American person who wants to live here for the rest of his life by abiding by the American/ Canadian laws of this land...hence my thinking is more practical and unbiased.

This Tanushree Dutta's return to India has nothing to do with ""Metoo"" movement or Bollywood casting couch or malpractices of Bollywood.

‚ö´All she is trying to do is get herself attacked again by some political party so that she can show to the US government that there is extreme threat to her life in India hence her US citizenship process should get expedited. She recently became American green card holder as she got it due to her Ex Miss India status and that too after so many years of struggle in the USA. She even celebrated her happiness on Instagram telling her fans that she finally got her much awaited Green Card and some of her crazy fans even cheered for her. (With Trump government...Obtaining green card has become an extremely slow and stringent process)

Now that she has become Green Card holder.....she expects the American citizenship after 5 or even more long years...(that is if the american government allows).

‚ö´ There is only one way to get what she wants....If she proves to the US government that there is an extreme threat to her life in India, that same process would get expedited and she will receive her American citizenship much more quicker and on a platter.

‚ö´Why did she not use this political asylum in USA stunt in 2008? Why now?
That is because as a Miss India contestant you become eligible for USA visa anyway. She knew very well, USA invites all those who come to Ms Universe contest and are easily given that O-1 visa status. More so the 2008 attack was not a political attack but a Sahara one journalist and cameraman attack...( In fact the cameraman was attacked by her own father who broke his camera) The cameraman was asking for compensation which was refused by them voilantly as well. This was never a political attack. She would have landed into a big trouble with the USA immigration for lying to them about it as a political attack. They would have gone to the root of it and after finding her lies, they would have denied her even that O-1 entry visa.

‚ö´So she never mentioned to it as a political attack then in 2008.

‚ö´Her green card in the USA took 5-6 years to process while she worked in the US on her O-1 Visa status which is given to people with extra ordinary entertainmaint ability from other nations.

‚ö´During these years, she stated she was taking spiritual studies in Ladakh and USA. If you check her Facebook/Instagram pictures there is hardly any spiritual message in it. In fact, all the pictures are provocative and in an attempt to keep her sex appeal attractive for her fans.

‚ö´Some desperate men follow anybody's Instagram.......even hers. Some of them even asked her to marry them or to come back in the movies. She knew she has a few thousands of fans whom she could influence in India.

‚ö´She only has one dream now....that is to settle down in the USA and enjoy the life there which she could not ever dream of in India.

‚ö´In Hindi film industry, she never made her name nor could she ever achieve any success like other actresses or former Miss India like Aishwarya, Priyanka, Sushmita to name a few. So the frustration continues.

‚ö´Now she has American green card with Indian passport. She also doesn't want to pay taxes in 2 countries. She would rather pay her taxes to the US government than to the Indian government where she has no interest whatsoever and nobody has interest in her....other than her Instagram fans. So the earlier she gets the US citizenship the better it is.

‚ö´She has studied the North American mentality very well. If she would have had the mob/ cameraman incident here in Hollywood, she would have sued the director/producer/the production house/studio for lack of security and would have made billion dollars here. Unfortunately that incident happened in India. She realized that she missed a golden opportunity of making money in India.

‚ö´ She knows very well, she has her Green Card... so anytime she decides she can run away to the U.S.A and let the Indians and India go to hell. Nothing that happens in India matters"
"There is one important observation. All actresses who are making allegations are those who didn't achieve big in Bollywood, have now exhausted their productive life or our out of work for a long time and have no chance of getting an assignment and who don't have a filmy background.
The actresses who had or our having a decent career and who don't have a filmy background are remaining silent.  It is clear that these ladies have an axe to grind.
Some are exaggerating their claims to make an emotional impact. Some are hoping for a financial settlement and hence want media to keep expanding the movement.  This is the very reason why nobody had filed a police complaint till date and want a media trial. 
Some filed a complaint because several commenters on social media were questioning their intent. 
Naming and shaming the accused through media is a tactic to bring them to negotiation table quickly."
SUCH A SHAME ON FILM INDUSTRY!!!!

"Bollywood makes anyway crap movies since some time...  few talented actors, actresses and directors keep it alive!!!"
One think not clear and if someone can please explain to me that once a man has made any inappropraite behavior why the lady would still go to meet him or enter his room alone

shame on nana patekar n sajid khan..both should be boycotted from bollywood
Out of work girls complaining because they turned down the offer.. the heroines are not complaining because they didn't turn it down and don't  want the world to know their true face or moral reality
"Yes, I noticed that too. In the Germanic-speaking world(northern Europe and north America) feminism is more extreme, while in the Romance language-speaking world (southern Europe and South America), the feminism is less extreme.."
"Sometimes there are consequences for saying ""no"". Salma Hayek wrote an article about her experience with Harvey Weinstein during the production of Frida. This is the worst situation when you have a person in power that can derail a project or make your job miserable."

"People need to understand that every feminist agenda or movement differ across the world. And within each country, you have different movements based on their personal groups struggles. And then within each country, you have different cultures and then races and then status in society whose each fight differs from the rest. I still get annoyed that when for example, in America, people tend to thing the feminist movements are the same for white women, Latino women and black women. It is all different. Unfortunately, the feminist movement is almost always about white women. 
All in all the feminist movement is going to be different when comparing US, UK, and France. I'm really only going to be concerned about my own home country, where I work and live while I am here."
