"""Believe all women"" led to Amber Heard. Never again with that nonsense."
“Believe all woman” that’s the dumbest thing I’ve amber heard
"""Virgin until I was married and proud of it"" man that's refreshing to hear"
Agreed! My ex lied ..they believed at first..then her story fell apart..our children told the truth.. her true colors came out.. and she ended up getting arrested!! Sad but I was so thankful that the justice system worked!! Shame on anyone who lies to smear a decent human being! Meaning all cases are separate and can't just believe any group/ category..seek the truth in every single case!
"They say ""believe all women,"" when they can't even define what a woman is."
I was a virgin until I got married too and it was the best decision of my life!!!
"The saddest part is after the woman is found to have lied, she gets no punishment and the man gets no reimbursement for the job, money, career he lost."
I 100% agree. There have been plenty cases were the woman was falsely accusing men of rape. Those men will never get rid of those accusations.
"""Virgin until married and proud of it"" - Takes balls to say that considering how many american trolls I encountered! Much respect! 💪🏻🇷🇴☦"
"Ben, my husband was slso a virgin. He remains the most honorable man I have ever met."
"""Believe all women"" and ""You can't define a Woman"" have somehow been said by the same group of people in the same political party. 
Ain't that wacky?"
"""Virgin until I was married and proud of it.""

My respect for him just went 📈📈📈📈📈"
"""I'm virgin until i got married ""
We exist guys, it's just that we don't usually use that as a brag

Damn now i want to brag with that"
The thing that bothers me most about ‘me too’ is when the woman is proven to have lied all the celebrities or politicians who came to her defence never apologize.
This man has a moral compass that is commendable.  God bless him and his conviction!
Women who lie and slander men need to go to prison for the same amount of time of a rape crime and it should be just as serious crime. just one more thing broken in the justice system?
"If we believe all women, then what do we do when one woman calls another woman a liar 🤔"
"No Ben, you are not the only man in America who is a virgin .... 39 years old and still waiting on the Lord to bless me with the joy and beauty of a God-centered, God-blessed marriage."
"I’m a female and I’m also waiting for marriage! So I’m happy that you also waited for marriage, not many people do that."
"You can hate Ben as much as you want, but you can't deny him because he is one of the few voices of reason."
“ you can’t believe all woman any more than u can believe all men “ agreed. With what’s mentioned in this vid really sheds a spotlight on what’s currently going on with the Amber heard and Johnny depp situation.
"""I am the only man in America who was a virgin until I got married and proud of it"" meanwhile, 28 year old virgin me doubting if I am American 🤔"
"When women get caught with false allegation they should get a minimum of 5 years. The man loses everything with one false allegation. His job, family, kids, ect..."
"As a woman, For heavens sake, Do Not believe all women. That is the craziest thing Ive ever heard."
"The whole ""believe all women"" idea worked so great for Disney, that they lost the entire Pirates series now. 😄"
"“Go ahead, tell everyone I hit you, they always believe the woman.” - My privileged-former girlfriend. She was just a moment. My two older sisters abused me my entire life, they are borderline sociopathic, a professor and guidance counselor. I keep my distance from all three, and they can all go to Hell."
"Feminists: ""Believe all women""
Patriarchy: ""What's a woman?""
Feminists: ""Ummm...."""
"I have never heared anybody say ""believe all women"" it is always rather ""believe the victim (untill proven otherwise)"" and it never refers to a court room but to everyday people interacting with the victim. It is supposed to protect actual victims from public abuse and mobbing."
"The moment I knew that ""Believe All Women"" was a lie was when my Ex said she loves me."
I wish I was made out of the same stuff as Ben Shapiro. He's completely brilliant and held up high moral standards for himself
"My son was a virgin until he got married at 25.  He always had girlfriends, but he practiced his Christian beliefs, which lost him a few gf's.  I'm very proud of him."
As a woman I know why all women should NOT be believed
My hubby was a virgin! He was 24 and we have been married over 30 years! Love you hubby!
The dude is just verbally and mentally talented
"I was a virgin till I married my wife, of twelve years now. Many coworkers/older men have told me they wish they had waited."
My admiration for Ben just went off the chart. A man that remained a virgin until marriage is a solid.
"To be a virgin until marriage is something that DEMANDS respect. You have mine, Ben."
“Believe all women” gave us women like Amber Heard and many others who took advantage of the #metoo movement. I’ll never understand how people can lie about things like that. Men also deserve to be heard and believed
My brothers are virgins and proud of it. Thanks Ben for advocating for men to be real men! It’s a beautiful thing when a man is a real man and woman is a real woman.
"My brother was stabbed my his female partner, she didn't even know why she did it! Two weeks in hospital with a punctured lung. So when people say men are the only abusers, it sends me nuts!"
"I remained a virgin till I was married as well Ben. For 27 years I remained one, and I can look my wife in the eyes and proudly say that she is the only woman that I've ever had a relationship in that manner with."
I got Johnny Depped by my ex. I'm glad the witch hunt against men is coming to an end and people are waking up without fear to speak out. You are my hero Ben Shapiro
Liberals: “Ben Shapiro hated women until his teenage years!”
I can guarantee you’re not the only man in America with that particular distinction
I am 17 and a virgin and plan to be till I'm married I am proud because it was very hard for me even being unpopular till 7th grade I had chances to lose it and I'm glad I didn't
"This is a piece of advice my parents gave me "" Don't believe anyone until they give you solid proof to do so. """
"Damn, a true sigma. Dude straight up said, “I was a virgin until I was married”."
"My son was accused of attempted murder, but his real crime was breaking up with her.  Her revenge was accusing him of trying to murder her.  It took $50K and three years to clear him.  There was no penalty for her."
"“Believe all women” tell that to my friend that was put in prison for rape. Only to be released 1.5 years later because they found out the girl lied, so that her long term boyfriend wouldn’t dump her for cheating on him."
"You're a man of principles. You're a good role model to our "" lost "" young generation that needs direction. Proud of you Ben. Keep up the good work. God bless you more!"
"When they say believe all women, just reply with two simple words, Amber Heard."
"“The only man in America who was a virgin until he got married and was proud of it” I’m sure he’s not the only man to have done this, but he’s probably one of the only men who was, in fact, proud of that"
The people that say believe all women never heard of the duke lacrosse scandal
The realism and backbone this man has is what needs to be taught to kids today! Speak the truth! Facts
This is literally the only  stuff on the internet that makes sense
"My mother is retired LEO, was the first person to educate me on this, blew my mind at a ""young"" age"
"I think it was Bill Burr who said ""Believe All Women!"" ""Um, have you met women?"" Lol"
"And then Amber Heard said, ""Me too!"""
"As a woman, yep. I agree with Ben here. Believe facts and not because of their gender, race or status. 

If a man abuses a woman, punish him as well as a woman abusing a man. No exemption."
"""believe all women when they claim a crime happened!""
or
""believe all men when they say 'okay, show me the proof'.""
one is insane, the other makes perfect sense."
“What about the psychos?” -Bill Burr
"As a woman, I am more inclined to believe a man over a woman."
We need many more people like Ben to go to the colleges and try and talk some sense into these brainwashed students nowadays. God bless you Ben!🙏🙌
"A smart man, an honorable man. God bless him. Amen."
"Ben is awesome .
He speaks logically which my brain is starving for.."
I agree with him on everything except one thing: he is not the only person to retain his virginity until marriage and be proud of it. My husband and I did the same thing and I personally know many others who make promises just like us and are proud to do so.
I love this man!!! He keeps it real. Virgin until married? Much respect. I'm Romanian orthodox and work.for  a kosher establishment.  This is awesome !!!
I'm a woman and I believe men way more than I do women.
"amber heard should be the face of why ""believe all women"" is bull malarkey."
"""Trust but verify."" - Horatio Caine (CSI Miami)"
This man is literally amazing.
"Same old concept ""don't believe everything you see on the Internet"" That can also be applied to people to any gender."
“Believe all woman” made me immediately think about the Amber Heard situation
Couldn’t agree with you more Ben.
I had my life destroyed by a liar. I may never fully recover.
"Basically the real root of the problem is... common sense. All these ""problems"" we keep running into is because it seems less and less people have common sense."
I can imagine how proud your parents are❤️👏🏻👏🏻God bless you Ben
"""Believe all women"" led to Amber Heard AND her lawyer

God, that women whom she calls a ""lawyer"" was insufferable"
"Believe woman that aren’t lying 
that would have been a better slogan"
"Honestly i agree with you just a lot
You are seen as right wing but you seem more left wing bc you actually love equality"
"The main reason I like YouTube over TikTok:
On YouTube, you have people who may not agree with Ben on everything but at least agreeing with Ben on this and people sharing their stories and people trying to console those people and we can all agree that this is a terrible thing. 
On TikTok, however, I guarantee at least half of these comments would be toxic, infuriating, and disgusting to look at. On TikTok, I guarantee you would see people who don't support Ben insulting and shitting on him instead of respecfully disagreeing with his stance. Also, I guarantee you would see a bunch of toxic ""feminist"" TikTok girls supporting ""the believe all women"" movement and invalidating the experiences of guys who have suffered at the hands of this #metoo shit. 

Trust me, as a frequent TikTok user and as someone who comes across these videos a lot, I promise you this is accurate, at least in comment sections for videos like this that I've seen."
"Johnny Depp has done a great service to men and the false accusations.  the me too movement is a disgrace to women.  When I was young I dealt with bottom touching, inapprpriate remarks with humour and walked away.  Trust me it stops."
"When a woman like Amber lies, it harms all women!  The liars need to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law!"
"Ben, you have brass balls! Respect!
Keep speaking the truth!
We need more courageous people like you!"
"2020: BELIEVE ALL WOMEN

2022: what's a woman?🤷"
"“Never trust women”
My mom"
Thank you Ben for speaking for the people in the back ! God your purity and thought process is refreshing. Gives me hope in this dark world 🌍
His mind is as fast and sharp as his tongue
"(Men) been told they should “Believe all women”... 
Truth is (Women) never “Believe all women”.."
Ahm...my husband was too...we both were...🥰
"I feel extremely inadequate when I hear ben speak. Damn, he's got his priorities straight"
I really miss the days when women were caring and compassionate people...
The more clips I see of him the more I wish he would run for President..  There's nothing we need more in this country than a president with a little bit of common Sense. And it seems like he has a whole lot of it.
I am so glad you speak the common sense truth.
As a woman I've learned in life that EVERYBODY lies
Ben was a virgin until marriage? Well that gives me a little bit of hope.
"Doubt should be had about statement that includes all, never, none, always, every."
Bro! I had tears suddenly! And a smile that someone spoke this afterall!😊
"""Women understand women...and they hate each other""
Al Bundy"
"Don't worry Ben, I was also a virgin when I married my husband, best decision ever"
Anger? Who is angry? She got what she deserved. Justice prevails.
"This has NOTHING to do with race, gender or socio-economic status. This is about someone having civil penalties after being caught in lie after lie"
It means nothing in the end. Depp wasn't setting out to punish Amber or care about the money. Depp's main focus was to clear his name.
Being a white powerful man doesn't automatically equate to being guilty. Most successful people are fairly decent and far from being abusers.
What it means is “just because your boyfriend is mean to you…doesn’t mean he’s a rapist.”
"To answer your title question, it means “don’t lie”. If you’re a true victim, you should come forward. If you’re not a victim, don’t disgrace yourself and say you are."
Blame amber for ruining it
"Amber Heard has turned the ""metoo"" movement into the ""menumbertwo"" movement"
This is totally bad journalism
"""Tell the world, Johnny, tell them,'Johnny Depp, I, a man, I'm a victim too of domestic violence'. And see how many people believe or side with you."""
"The fact that the feminist movement rallies around and defends an abusive woman on account of her gender, is damning against them. They are abuse apologists."
I just lost some brain cells watching this discussion.. this toxicity of believe all women without evidence will backfire badly .
"So even though a jury has made their ruling the “me too” babies still thinks Johnny D is wrong and did violence on AH, his wife.  I am not for any man hurting any woman or child.   All we have is the court to tell us yes, no and who is less then honest.  Every woman with any accusation needs to be heard.  This is not me too, this is a complaint of violence."
Meetoo movement never even existed.
"The MeToo movement is at last packing up. It brought us on a train which took us to a new destination, albeit portions of it was gruelling and sour. Equilibrium is being achieved"
Are men not to be believed? Can men not be dv victims? Hopefully the media will be more balanced in reporting and #metoo will have space for male victims.
"You only have to scratch below the surface level to understand the insane nuances of this trial that should place it separately from the overall metoo movement. Honestly, I think these opinions may be incorrectly informed by people who did not watch the full trial, are not as familiar with the American justice system, and a media attempting to follow a narrative. The jury instructions included the ability for jurors to discount some or all testimony for individuals they believed were lying. As someone who followed a large part of the trial, I do believe there was mutual abuse and Depp should only have succeeded in 1 count. However, there was _so_ much deception and exaggeration on Amber's part exposed that I surmise the jury decided they were not able to rely on any of her tedtimony"
Amber Heard self destruct her career😂
Tara Reade.
"Remember the Gaby Petito story? Maybe if people weren't so quick to dismiss domestic violence or so quick to side with the boyfriend, she'd still be alive."
"Was Tara reade
A me too girl?
🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️"
Metoo was just another way for these people to cry over themselves. Nothing new. We dealt with this whiney behavior our entire lives. Our kids will suffer through it as well
All this is moot now as our latest Supreme Court justice can't give a definition of a woman!
"Now, if we could only get the Gaetz's and Kavanaugh's out of the government."

# justice for Johnny Depp
The problem with this movement is the definition of a woman….what is a woman
Where’s the me too. When biological men are dominating women’s sports.
President Trump will PREVAIL!
What is a woman?
Me too. Keeping sexism alive and well.
Some men need to grow up and stop being players of women.
I would say the me too movement won a victory in including that males can also be victims. It is a gain for taking a look at evidence and not prejudging based on gender.
"Vow... She hit him.clocked him, threw a bottle at him severing his finger,pooped on his bed, chased him to 5 bathrooms.. all on tape  and he is the bad guy for suing her?...
Wonderful"
"Whoever it is talking in this, I think they missed a lot of the tones and arguments from the trial. It seems crazy how folks are still trying to defend amber’s actions."
People dismissing Amber's actions sets back me too. Grouping her with victims sets back me too
"It's not a setback for women or DV victims. 
If anything it's a major win for both Men and Women who were abused.
The Real Setback would have come if Johnny lost this trial"
"No one is saying ""women lie"".  People are saying Amber Heard is a lying liar who lies."
It really shocks me the sexist reporting that has come from this if you watched the trial you would know she photo shopped pictures admitted to hitting Johnny and lied on the stand is it really so hard to understand that amber heard lost and that it was a win for victims of domestic violence because a type of abuse against men got brought to attention
Here. Let me fix that title: Amber Herd's Lies Set Back the Me Too Movement and Endangers Vulnerable Women Everywhere.
"First of all, as a journalist, you should know that Johnny Depp was the plaintiff in this case- not the defense. And this is not a case of women lying about abuse- it's a case of THIS woman lying about abuse. The evidence in testimony by Depp and Heard, their friends and expert witnesses, countless audio tapes, and manipulated photos led where it led- and justice actually prevailed when it was warranted. This wasn't about fans or an ""anti-me too"" movement. Time to jump late onto the bandwagon of truth."
"No , this verdict is not a setback for real victims of domestic violence because Amber was never a victim of domestic violence  to begin with. Amber herself  seems  to be  a perpetrator of violence on many different levels towards both men and women .  The woman talking in this video  is not living on the same planet the rest of us are."
People support Johnny because they see who the real victim was in this relationship.
"The defense team played into revealing the truth that Amber Heard is a liar. People always try to apply these things to much bigger issues, but you can't ignore that this was a case of two people who most likely abused one another, only the general public decided to celebrate the woman while villanizing the man. I'm personally happy that this trial has brought a lot to light and corrected the damage to Depp's reputation that Heard caused."
Amber did a lot of damage to countless women who are the real victims of domestic abuse
Finally male victims might dare to speak up
"Completely disagree he showed enough evidence that he was a victim “too” not that he was completely innocent, the veredict is that “She lied” not that he was innocent of the toxic relationship."
"""An imperfect victim""? WTF? She lied."
"It's funny now that she's not a perfect victim, how come these people can't come to terms that Johnny Depp was the victim in this relationship? How come everytime a man tries to come out that they're a victim there's always a convenient excuse for them like this? It's awful and disgusting."
Tell me you didn’t actually watch the trial without telling me you didn’t actually watch the trial 🙄
"Love how she calls Amber Heard both the ""victim"" and also the one ""hitting Johnny depp"" within the same sentence, and still doesn't get the irony 👌👌"
"Heard is a truly messed up individual and shouldn't be believed or sympathized with. Johnny may have his issues but he proved he wasn't the abuser. Why is he ""anti metoo,"" the movement should welcome men who were victims - shameful of you!"
"that's a bs argument ""women lie"" ""she's not a perfect witness"". she lost because she lied and lied and lied. she made up stories against JD while she was on the stand. who does that, except a very sick individual who wants to destroy another. she decided to make herself the face of abused women everywhere when she was nothing of the sort. the verdict should have added an apology on her part to JD live in the court room. victims everywhere deserve nothing else"
What level of evidence would it take to convince a person with this opinion that men can be victims of domestic violence too?
…or… the facts of the case contradicted with ambers testimony. Her own photos proven to be heavily edited when she claimed “different lighting”
"What? “I don’t think they did permanent damage” 

THE DUDE LITERALLY GOT FIRED AND KICKED OUT OF THE CAST IN TWO MOVIES

What did you smoke today?"
"I'm sorry, but she, among other things, severed his finger, literally shat on his bed, admitted to hitting him. 

To say that he won because of his ""star-power"" and ""anti me-too sentiment"" just proves that no-one takes men seriously when they DO come forward and share the abuse they have gone through."
“An imperfect victim”? No she was the abuser. Cut and dry. This is a disgusting take.
"If there was an imperfect victim in this trial, it would be Johnny Depp."
This wasn't anti me-too.  This was an abusive woman who was caught lying after the jury weighed 6 weeks worth of evidence.  I'm sorry but did we watch the same trial?
Now Amber can finally say that Johnny beat her
"Also, Johnny Depp was the plaintiff and Amber Heard was the defendant. Very neat slight of hand calling JD's legal team the ""defence"". They weren't. That was AH's team. Like in a criminal case."
Wait…did u guys not watch the trial…and all the evidence…I love this channel but I did not expect this from here…
I'd never heard of EJ Dickson before and after this take I hope I never hear of her again.
"If were gonna talk about imperfect victims can we look at Johnny Depp for a moment.  Hes a man, struggling with alcohol and drug abuse, with a habit of using very politically incorrect language in confidence with his friends.  Hes the type of wealthy influential hollywood guy that's the perfect candidate to be the next perpetrator in a metoo case and yet against all odds the evidence that he was in fact the victim appears to be the most favourable.  If we were to characterize depp's circumstances in this case id struggle to find a more apt description than that of an imperfect victim."
"He didn't have fans. He had lost all good will. The guy couldn't go to a fan gathering or convention without people booing him and calling him a wife beater.
If he truly had ""fandom power"", if the ones supporting him are truly ""fans"" then none of the above in the last 6 years should have ever happened to him.

The ones supporting him are less his fans and more fans of justice. The first of these supporters came after the UK trial but because that was a tight and behind closed doors case, this wave of supporters was small in number. But these were the people you referred to when you said he had quite a bit of goodwill before the US case already.

Now Johnny has more supporters than ever because the truth has reached a lot of people. So no, Amber Heard is not an imperfect victim as she is not a victim at all. She is an abuser."
"No way this commentator watched the trial or listened to any of the arguments from mental health professionals. 
[Add: Anti-MeToo movement? Okay, so what she's doing here is ignoring the men who are victims, and that's not even slightly acceptable. Find better commentary, NowThis.]"
"“I think…I think… I think…”
Lots of opinions and no facts. The title does not present it as fact, but I was brought here by a link and that header did make it look like I was going to be presented with facts."
What a terrible sexist take. The only thing the JD lawyers did was get Amber to tell on herself which she did multiple times.
Wow. So this entire take just ignores all of the actual evidence and instead just argues from a pre-assumed position.
"No, it is not a setback."
Ok so I might be misunderstanding the verdict… I’ve seen a few editorials about the verdict that all allude to Amber being a victim of domestic abuse and that the verdict is “anti-me too sentiment” and that this verdict will scare victims of domestic abuse from ever speaking out lest they too be gaslit and not believed just like Amber. But the thing is it was my understanding that the court ruled she had lied about being a victim of domestic abuse and that’s why Johnny was awarded the settlement. So if she lied about the abuse how is she a victim of domestic abuse? And how does this scare women from coming forward with their legitimate domestic abuse experiences if in the end amber wasn’t abused and it was her lying about it that is the issue. So you see my confusion? I guess I’m wondering if Amber did suffer legitimate abuse from Johnny coz it was my understanding her accounts were fictionalized.
I didnt ever see the depp legal team pose themselves against the metoo movement or make any anti metoo movement remarks.  Their position was firmly yes we support the metoo movement but no amber heard is not a victim of abuse but on the contrary a victimizer.  I'll admit I only started watching the hearing for about the last week or 2 of testimony so theres definitely stuff ive missed but from what I've seen of the proceedings if anyone did damage to the metoo movement it was amber.
It wasn’t about an anti me too - she wasn’t just an imperfect victim She DID lie and it was totally proven
"Rubbish. They had their ‘work cut out’ because she LIED like a RUG. 
Depp wasn’t a favorite of mine…he scarcely made my radar. 
He’s a fave now. 
Look: women can lie. Yes, they can."
"I think it's very important to realise that there will always be people who try to exploit systems to their advantage at every angle you look at it.

The MeToo movement is extremely important for getting victims believed, but bad people can, will and have used that to claim false victimhood, which can only hurt the movement and genuine victims, and it's important to now refine it.

I don't believe it can be called anti-MeToo, as it seems many many victims have been saying they don't believe Amber. And they are either telling the truth as genuine survivors, or lying to get support on Depp's side, which again shows how manipulatable it can be. They definitely aren't all lying though..."
If you claim it's a setback then you're basically agreeing with what we've known all along.  That feminism is women vs men and that laws to protect victims are not for us.
"Why is the title of the video formulated to exclude the influence of the veracity of the accusers? If unquestioningly deferring to a white man’s voice is evil, which it is, then unquestioningly deferring to a white woman’s voice is just as inhumane, for both the one and the other is dehumanizing - to be human is to be held measurable before an outside criteria irrespective of gender, racial and other traits, is it not ?"
No. It is not a set back. Amber is not  a well person their relationship was toxic both of them need to get clean and sober but there is no way Johnny physically or sexually abused her. It just seemed so obvious how much lying she did at the trial and how arrogant she is. Nothing is ever her fault.
The coverage of the verdict is a setback for common sense. Not all accused are guilty and gender is irrelevant. Misogyny is a separate issue.
"Depp's side was the Plaintiff in the action, not the Defense..."
"You don't exploit the truth. You uncover it. Your vernacular is very telling of your character.
Did the verdict hurt MeToo? Absolutely.
Whose fault is that? Well, not the person in the title of the video, that's for sure."
This is some of the most irresponsible commentary on this trial I've seen yet. Did she even watch the trial? Depp was the plaintiff in his case of defamation.  Heard was the defendant.
"How is the conclusion here that the lawyers ""cannily"" fed into some anti women movement and not that the ""imperfect victim"" has fed the movement by literally lying? This is the wrong hill to die on."
"I'm guessing your word of the day app gave you ""cannily"" before this interview 😂"
"It's not all bad for Amber, she landed an endorsement deal with Charmin toilet paper."
"Disgusting take.
METOO is for the victim, which he was. Absolute disgrace of a article/video."
I'm convinced this person didn't watch the trail
"EJ Dickenson here isn't the most trustworthy or unbiased source on the interwebs..
She has described the ""Libs of Tik Tok"" account as being ""transphobic"".
The account she refers to posts un-edited videos from extremely liberal Tik Tok accounts.
It takes a special kind of person to call someone a transphobe for DARING to re-post un-edited videos that the users themselves felt where perfectly acceptable."
"Depp was the plaintiff, not the defense. If you can't even get that part right while analyzing the case, I have to seriously doubt that this commentator even watched the testimony or reviewed the evidence. If she believes Depp was the defendant in the original complaint (not the countersuit) then it's no wonder she has such a bad take."
"This was the video that made me click ""dont recommend posts from this channel"""
did amber write this script jesus
"Any movement that promotes guilty without trial is trash and should be discouraged. Only due process is the way to justice, It is not perfect but it will protect the innocent with higher probability."
"How is showing evidence an exploit? Why are some people choosing to be blind? The evidence amber heard was an abuser was compelling enough to prove she was lying. Fake crying then instantly not crying the next second shows serious issues and theatrics. Was johnny 100% innocent? No, but he was the main victim and this is an obvious case than woman CAN be abusers. Stop pretending like this is a loss for victims of abuse since the abused were vindicated in this case."
Why is it so hard for people like you to admit that she is a DV abuser? It's ok to be biased but atleast be subtle
"He didn't have a defense team, you silly sausage. He was the plaintiff.. You sure you're in the right line of work?"
How about all the evidence? And witnesses?  Maybe that had something to do with the verdict
"MeToo doesn't have to be solely for women. Anyone can be a victim of abuse. Can't a man say, ""I was abused"" too?"
"People supported Johnny because when a “victim” says she’s abuse. Then again is caught say “I just smacked you” I didn’t “hit you.” You know that’s going to cause huge issues. Especially when she faked her own blood with wine, she was being a psychopath in believing her own lies. Yes Johnny wasn’t purely innocent, but she took small situations and painted it as if she was being held against her will, which is pure bs."
If compiling data and facts is anti me too then we have a way bigger problem.
"This video is the embodiment that only men can be the abuser while only women can be the victim. There won't be a setback as this video entail, it will be a direction towards inclusion of men can ALSO be a victim and can also speak out and hold women accountable for such actions."
"Me too applies to men as well. If anything, this is a great step forward for the movement"
There was no ' defence' team. It was a civil trial. You are clearly not that expert on the matter.
The only setback we’re facing is the fact that God put Amber on this Earth in the first place.
Whoever it is in this video is quite offensive towards the jurors by implying that they did not decide the case based on the facts presented during the past six weeks but are also ruling in favor of Depp because he has been a famous movie star for years. This person in biased and most of all too lazy (or dumb) to even try to understand what the case is about.
"Lmao how did they play Into these when the jury was not allowed to view anything outside of the court room? All Johnny wants is to be free of his narcissistic abuser, leave him alone now."
"Please do not victimize the abuser! In this case Amber. An abuser needs to be judged, does not matter if it a he, she or they."
Amber lying is a set back. Once again blaming the victim instead of addressing the actual abuser because they're a woman
Amber was the defendant lol… she didn’t watch the trial. @NowThis this is embarrassing. Do a better job vetting your post.
I wish YouTube shows the number of dislikes again
Reported as fake news. Do better.
Unsubscribed.. stop posting false information
She wasn’t an imperfect victim! She wasn’t a victim at all!
"Is this video saying he got away with something? 
Are you implying abusing men is ok?"
She got busted for lying. Case closed.
"Yes, because she damaged women to come that are REAL victims of domestic abuse. She got caught lying, numerous times and admitted on tape she punched/hit and abused Johnny. His ""star power"" had nothing to do with her performance. An innocent man was found NOT guilty in a court of law. I hope she goes broke paying him back."
me too should stop making Amber their champion to their movement they could pick more credible and honest but they pick a beautiful face than the truth.
"I am a woman, 72 years old used to be a police artist and the majority were raoe victims. However i think MeToo went too far. It is a good thing but every accusation is not true."
This is funny 🤣😜😝. And she is saying all that with a straight face too. Maybe SHE should be in Aquaman 2. 😂🤣😂
No bcuz now he is a part of the me too movement.
This is a stupid take . People dont trust her cos she did abuse him. While she kept lying. Abused men shouldnt be neglected.
The delusion is real with this one...
"You wanna talk about abuse? Let’s talk about the emotional abuse women put men through constantly, constantly and constantly. Why is it men never have a problem with anyone until a women comes into his life? Are you ever going to address this issue?"
"Amber Heard is to the me too movement, what Bruce Jenner is to LGBTQ."
We that followed the trial came to another conclusion. Dickson is  girlguessing.
"""Imperfect victim...""

This is a horrible take. Downvote, even if you can't see."
Not every victim is a woman men suffer too
"Definitely unsubscribed, all media outlets that are heavily biased don't deserve our time."
It’s a setback for liars
Imperfect victim? Minus the victim
The defense was successful? I thought Johnny Depp won. He was the plaintiff.
Me too movement should be for both men and women
Biggest reason of failing me too in India is females and their relative have started using their modesty as an excuse for everything.
"Please ask these woke people to raise their voices against the atrocities which are happening on men.
They are soo vivacious on one such vile man to be on air but these are silent when the men are subjected to brutal and depressing torture using the same laws which were made to protect them.
I'd like to see a discussion on that too Mrs. Jacob....along with the same panel.
Let us see if i have the guts to be soo called champions of true journalism"
The entire Bollywood industry will be dismantled as young women regularly sleep for roles. The minute she doesnr land one role she is now a survivor.
No Logic Just Emotional Manipulation .
Me-Too is a joke.  Men deserve Due-Process.
Metoo is great if the accusations are true but all need due process instead of guilty by accusation.No one man or woman should be falsely accused.
It's time for #MenToo. Equality
"Lots of women love Andrew Tate, you can't please everyone."
"This entire report was a joke that dismisses the Men's Rights movement. Conflating Men's Rights with Pick-Up Artists like Andrew Tate is incredibly insulting. Everyday working and middle class young men are in trouble. They're raised in increasingly fatherless homes and woman-dominated school systems that cannot provide the social and emotional resources for a boy to become a man. Listen to Warren Farrell, one of the original Men's Rights proponents. Other public intellectuals like Nicholas Eberstadt or Richard Reeves can tell you about the specific issues that men face on a demographic and population level. If you're interested in individual- and community-level issues, please look up the statistics about who dies from suicides, overdoses, violent criminal deaths, and workplace accidents. Boys and men now less frequently complete education and training or seek gainful employment. This is not good for women, either. There are perfectly valid reasons for the anti-feminist backlash, and men have quickly caught on and noped out of entanglement with increasingly women-dominated spaces."
What they don't realize is young men follow Andrew Tate because they get tired of being called bad by every other part of society.
"Me too, is a bunch of liers  who want to be a victim"
"This report total ignores the bad behavior of young women today (high body counts, gold digging, unfair hiring practices, etc.) I think people are sick of every group claiming they’re victims."
Does metoo support pro life women and Tara Reade
"Conclusion of this video feminism is miss understood but MRA is misogynistic ,give me a brake🙄"
The solution is not letting kids use social media because there are thousands of pages that post content that you don’t want a 14 year old to watch
I never heard any male ever say its okay to harm women what movement is this.
Andrew Tate is the G.O.A.T.🎉🎉🎉🎉
"It really feels like the movement started falling flat when CIS straight men started coming forward with their contributions and were mentioning they were victimized the same way, but by women. In the end it felt kind of like this movement was meant for us to publicly out and go after the ""bad touch"" people, but ONLY if they were men and well off men, at that."
"If I was in that room when he asked for a raise of hands, I'd raise 'em...both middle fingers high and proud."
feminist and incels keep calling me an incel... and im not even an incel...
"Sooner or later, every interaction that a man has with a woman can lead to #MeToo."
Don't forget...victims have a responsibility too
At least you're able to speak your MIND
I have a metoo story as a guy at school I was outside and this girl smacked my butt
What's continuously missing is intervention for abusers befor acting on abuse.
"You know what's so funny about this is that it doesn't bother me because I heard it all before. A movement comes out, and it empowers a small minority, and things go downhill from here.
May I remind everyone here of what happened to #girlboss ? May I remind you Wing? Man Repeller? They all were part of the movement and faced instances of lawsuits regarding fraud, copyright and employee discrimination.
Not only that, but there are old school feminists out there who actually hates this current generation of feminists because they support non-binary and transwomen as women, which defeats the purpose in the eyes of older feminists. The point I'm getting at is by the end of the day it's all the same! 
We're all human, we lie, we cheat, we steal! So change whatever you want, the game is still the same even if it's all women in the same room. Hate is hate especially in the name of good intentions."
"I do think that the casting couch was real and many directors did abuse their position. But it feels like all men as a group were tarred with the same brush, which i think was unfair. I think influencers like Tate have gained an audience from that."
Women are so jelouse of the tate he’s a real man
"I blame all mainstream media, the metoo movement and the clowns at the top."
All very messy.Simpler with Landlines . Autumn for me.. Good luck Gen Z you're going to have to save us to save yourself.
Anyone notice the guys phone case.
"Feminism is a self-correcting problem.
MeToo was an emotions first social movement. There was no logic, reason or common sense involved. 
Innocent until proven guilty and due process was destroyed.
Years later women today are more fearful, despondent, depressed, taking SSRIs, suffering from alcoholism, overworked, indebted and lonely than ever before.
The dating and marriage market have also been thoroughly destroyed, replaced with hookup apps, pump and dump, cohabitation and fatherless homes.
Women view husbands and fathers as optional, and only if they are “economically attractive”.
The number of single bachelors is exploding.
They did it to themselves."
"Another reason why they are after Tweeter, raw power to the people to finally be heard unedited!"
How about y’all stay off of social media.
This has nothing to do with me.... Why am I here??? 😳
me2 vs mgtow
#mepoo
And ofcourse we didn't hear any comment about the fault allegations... Happy now ?
"Anybody In The World: Exists and does literally nothing.

The MeToo Movement: How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man?!

The MeToo Movement in a nutshell."
I can see why gen z did not change nothing because of woman abusing the movement and great video :]
#MENTOO
I think they really downplaying the impact of those “celebrity” women coming out about it; there is an assumption that if you’re wealthy and influential it will bypass you.
"4:41 Nobaby in the red pill community ever said that bro, nobody. I watch stephiscold and fresh and fit. They are trying to tech men about female psychology and self improvement. If you crash your bike get hurt real bad, obviously you’re gonna try your best to not make the same mistake again. It's not misogynistic to better yourself."
There is nothing I'm out of the pick up artist is
I am reporting this video & channel for dangerous & hateful propaganda against a group - at 4:41 thru 4:58
"I guess something that made a huge change for women, seems to have faded away to make room for a new cause the world could jump on board with. I still feel they made a huge change  I feel, like with anything, the old movement needs to bow down to the new movement & if it conflicts with it, they will be the ones attacked. That’s why the me too movement has gone silent about current events."
Hashtag quality over quantity
#Metoo includes college sexual assault. The stance taken is like Roe vs Wade. GenZ stance is from a lack of knowledge...you do not know what you have until you lose it. Strength lies in numbers. If GenZ believes their issues are not included - then include them. There is enough room for everyone.
the THICKTOK generation!!
Wow 🎉
so what?
Who cares?
Me Too turned into OnlyFans great work!
"USA: People of ALL Colours stimulate each other and spice things up in American society. Make it vibrant, alive, loving and active. The government and Police are on YOUR side including everyone who is good. Together we move FORWARD towards our Light and Free Air.

We love Andrew tate
❤
"Those Gen Z women don't get it.  #MeToo isn't a _solution_ to the problem -- it's a *_movement._*  They need to join that movement in order to keep it going and have it mean something.  They can't sit there on their butts and expect the world to change for them.

As for that Andrew Tate character -- it's hilarious that THAT is what is being portrayed and idolized as the ideal alpha male.  To any men seeing this, he does NOT read as an alpha male to a woman.  Maybe to other men, but not to women.  He comes across as all facade -- a total bluff by a weak individual.  I'll bet any money that in the privacy of his bedroom, he's terrified he'll be discovered as a fraud.  So if you want to register as important to other men, then sure, follow him.  But don't complain that women don't like you or don't get you or whatever it is that makes ya'll so angry."
"Why you don’t address male issues?… it is normal to have these reactions, when you ignore the numbers. And these numbers are men, people."
"""Me Too"" was initially used in this context on social media in 2006, on Myspace, by sexual assault survivor and activist Tarana Burke"
"These kind of videos is the best recruiting tool for the Republican party. They cannot see how scripted and ridiculous they sound. No wonder Republicans are about to sweep the mid terms to help set up our President, that the streets miss very much, to take his rightful seat back on the throne. The media still doesn't get it. Truly amazing!!"
"My respect for this women would have drastically increased if she said this and added ""I don't support false accusers"". The fact that she is trying to downplay what Amber Heard did while playing a safe game, is why people lost faith in Me-too. I never seen Tarana Burke be so neutral when it was a male abuser."
"She gaslighting,  she just wants the money to keep rolling in , she should be a politician,  she good at evading the questions."
"its funny how so many people that are like ""What if it was your daughter?"" never ask ""What if it was your son?"""
"The Depp v Heard Trial is a great example of how effective the US Court System is. Coming into the case, Heard had the law on her side. However Depp had the facts on his side. The Depp v Heard verdict propelled our society towards the right direction. Sexual abuse has no gender."
"I think this verdict has been great for the #MeToo movement because it will hopefully destigmatize men speaking up about abuse from their partners. And also, maybe it’ll incentivize people not to lie, that way, real victims of abuse and assault get all the attention."
"I’m beginning to doubt that this woman has never been abused, If she watched all of this trial. This trial not just the verdict but the entire trial should be better for the me too movement and that’s all she would have said. She’s going in circles and it’s disgusting."
"Abuse has no gender. I have compassion for anybody who's suffered. In this case, Depp was the abused victim and Heard was the abuser. If we turn it into a gender war, then we have lost our way. It is not about men vs women. It is about the facts of the case and what happened in the relationship between two people. Anybody can suffer from DV at the hands of their partner no matter their gender."
"Everything she just said reminded me of Amber Heard testifying on the stand. Saying a whole lot of intensified words and not saying a damn thing. Downplaying the negative impact Amber Heard caused with her false allegations, isn't doing anyone any favors. Just admit the whole movement had the wool pulled over their eyes. To act like the problem lies with the judicial system, instead of the people involved, is just a way to avoid admitting that they messed up."
Amber doesn't care about MeToo or she would never have tried to weaponize it for her own selfish ends.
"Woman, we believed her for 6 years, no qns asked. He lost his job, his reputation, and his credibility. Your movement became a cover for some predatory women."
Its so sad that all these strong women who bash men for lying and hurting there spouse now are doing the same thing the abusers did to them to Johnny just because hes a man it seems that there are no more true ricious people on either side anymore this mind set is toxic
"She lost all my respect. If metoo supports abusive women, then this is not something I will support."
It's an non answer. She evading from making a statement.
"Trust me NO sane man wasn't to go anywhere NEAR this woman. No one will EVER sexually harass her, maybe that's why she is so angry."
"It is exactly the same system that (rightly) convicted many men. When Tarana alleges the system is broken, does this mean those men may have been wrongfully convicted?"
"""That's what I want people to refocus on."" Is synonymous with ""the verdict was right, but if I answer the question and admit it people will think MeToo is dead""."
"I think the justice system is working!  It helped to expose Amber's lies and reveal the actual abuser, Johnny.  It has helped all abuse survivors regardless of gender."
Its a scam obviously. Metoo is just a money scam
"Without her bogus movement, she'll have to get an actual job."
She’s delusional. Amber is lying 🤥. F out here with this bs Tara and you know it
Don’t be sexist. I thought the #Metoo is about Abuse victims not a Woman only allowed one. Support men too they can be victims too.
"She sounds like she belongs on the Heard’s counsel. She was just as good at evading the question as Amber and Elaine. 

What did she really say in this convoluted response? That the system is broken when finally something actually worked correctly and a jury actually sided with facts? That the case wasn’t about the MeToo movement when Amber herself declared in her pre-written losing statement after the trial that this is a setback for the movement. If anything it opens the door wider for inclusivity. It starts the path to undoing the stigma around victimized men. Men are victims too. They suffer different types of abuse. They face more wrath when they come forward to tell the truth. They are ridiculed by peers for being victims at the hands of their partners. It is not fair."
She's crazy
A victim gets justice. An abusive liar has to pay damages. And your response is that our system is broken?
Why people still give voice for people like this lady?? WHY??? They’re only running for money and fame PERIOD
I’m confused… her answer didn’t seem to have anything to do with the Depp/Heard trial? It seemed more of a vague sentiment that the justice system in general doesn’t support victims of SA… how is this even relevant to Depp/Heard? Someone explain this please… I’m just not getting it…
"Finally someone who mentions class inequality when it comes to me too.
It was never about rich peoples trials. It was never about high profile court verdicts. It was about everyday people who cannot afford personal nurses, penthouses to go to, lawyers, etc to be able to tell their stories and feel empowered to do so. To not feel guilty for being victims. To not feel like it was their fault something horrible happened to them. It was about empowering victims by knowing they are not alone, that there is hope and life doesn't end the moment you are victimized because you are a survivor of it already. And it is about supporting those victims."
She sounds like the founder of BLM🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wish we could give this girl control of the system for a while just to see how fast it falls apart.
"Get out of here with this! First of all this was NOT a trial about domestic. It was a flipping defamation trial, so there’s THAT. Second I’m getting really tired of hearing this because to say this makes it sound like men can’t be abused, only women so what is she saying that if a woman speaks up she automatically HAS to be believed, doesn’t matter she’s lying through her teeth but be on her side anyway?🤷🏻‍♀️ Yeah I’m not doing that because domestic violence is something that men and women go through, both genders not just one."
MeToo founder and power grab expert. She needs to be sent to prison!
"Great reply. Everyone seems to have misunderstood that we shouldn't want to talk about famous people or individual verdicts at all. It's not about individual data points, but about overall harm reduction in society. Amber Heard exploited a movement that is far bigger than her. You can be for the movement and against its misuse."
Tarana is wise. She's refusing to allow spoiled little rich girl Amber to guilt feminists into supporting her.
I’m so tired of these random people becoming “the voice” or “representative” of whatever just saying a bunch of words that have no meaning. She said nothing of value talked in circles. Ring intelligent and trying to sound intelligent are completely different things
"If this is the reasoning of the #METOO founder, then f that it's #MEPOO now"
"Wise words from Ms. Burke. I wish she'd been more vocal about justice for all victims including men, but she's absolutely right. Metoo can't run on verdicts. False accusers need to stop using (fake) domestic violence as a weapon."
She is such a politician
What a Phony woman
Metoo founder is amber turding
"EVERYBODY LOOK, SHE’S TELLING A JOKE."
"No matter what the topic is when I see Taranasarous all I can think of when I see her is poor thing because her pain is always visible, you can just see it on her face."
Ugh
Our system might be broken at times. However in the the case of the Depp vs Heard the system worked perfectly. Most of those speaking out in support of the verdict are woman. Any damage done to sexual abuse survivors was done by Amber Heard and her lies. If a man is wrongly accused he has the right to defend himself.
I heard this woman talk and I saw her lips move but she didn't say anything... Blah blah blah blah...
Now a political movent with their own political agenda
ABUSE HAS NO GENDER 😠
This black woman in America is making fortune from movements 😂 they are really smart
"Lets take a vote. 
Like for the: The Justice system that considers evidence and relies on due process facts when serving ALL the people in the country. Which does make mistakes. 
Comment for the: Metoo movement that relies on he said-she said with she said having more worth. That demands ostracization before proof and is mainly for women only and brings up more feelings than facts about a individual case."
Are you saying that blindly it doesn’t matter ?
No one is ever trying to metoo this lady
Metoo says it's ok for women to abuse men. Case closed 🤣
"If she believed Amber Heard, she would have said, ""I believe Amber Heard."" But she didn't say that. I think that might mean she also sees that Amber Heard wasn't truthful."
"How can anyone respect this woman anymore after seeing this? The role model has turned a blind eye to the real picture here. Blaming the system and backing a liar. What a shame. Whatever clout she has, or may have had is gone now. SMH"
Why cant she say there are also abused men
She maybe does not have any families that get abused in DV. Beside too much pride for admitting facts that DV abuser can be both woman and man.
IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS WOMAN DID NOT WATCH THE ENTIRE TRIAL HENCE HER RIDICULOUS COMMENT. PLEASE WATCH THE TRIAL BEFORE YOU TALK RUBBISH. 🙄
She ought to be ashamed of herself 😡😡😡
Why is she on a stage talking. She is just saying words at the point.
Ugh this is so backwards
"So it wasn't a proud moment for the movement with any case of victory or milestone in these cases then , why highlight them in your speeches why even talk about them. Now your emphasis is about a broken system and not about your Slogan ""believe all women"". Women who are taught from the same books, seeing all the flaws and just taking advantage of them. 
A mouth is define by its user. A safe heaven for preys with your statement leave the door opens for predators.

But that doesn't matter because men problems aren't your concern. Any problem men has is a win for your movement to further push your narrative. Because the laws that dictates the system is what your really trying to change. Because in your head men are the driving force behind these laws, because most of them were done by said party throughout history. So its broken."
"The Black Belt Barrister has a petition to Re-open Appeal (UK) of Johnny Depp defamation case, following unanimous US Jury Verdict
Please help by signing his petition"
There is literal evidence that she lied. Wtf is up with y'all?
Why hasn't Amber heard been charged yet????
"What system? Sure maybe it sometimes broke, but 'the system' it's a bit to general, can't she be more specific? 

I am Dutch can anybody explain to me what she is talking about?"
Never seen such a bright gas 💡 light.
"I think they lose the case not because she lied or because of bad adv, it simply is just because she amber was the one who abused her JD.."
"So what is The system ?
Believe all women ?"
Shes right. Johnny had the money to go after his truth.most mencant.and most women cant
"may be change #MeToo to #BashMen, to make it more appropriate for your (new) agenda @Tarana. A whole new movement!"
is she trolling? or did she not watch the trial at all?
Time to end the #metoo
this lady is an L tbh
"Sure okay, but would she of said that if her Victim had won? If all won (against Men)?
Fine, but I do see a failure in their trial of who is Victim, they gave Her all benefits."
Weak excuse...Tarana could and should admonish Amber Heard and others like her to protect those who are truly violated.  She should discourage those who are dishonest in telling their metoo story.
I have no idea what she was saying 🤔
"Stop piling shit on her
She has been punished severely
No need for every single media outlet to carry such a violent campaign against her"
Wise words
I don’t feel her words made any sense
What a disappointing answer.
What system would you replace it with? They never answer this question. ✌️
Justice for johhnny!!!!
"Lol to be fair she has a point. Many people were brought to ""justice"" because of the me too movement and there is always an exception to the rule with Heard and Depp that serious allegations necessitate proper due diligence. However,  survivors continue to suffer long after the abuse has stopped so me too is essentially about harm prevention so when someone comes forward, people will believe them and make sure they are safe first and foremost."
"Men can’t be victims of abuse, they hold the position of power
Justice for amber heard"
Yeah yeah yeah.  The entire movement has been a scam.
Woow i thought she would talk smack but  she did it other way but how she wants to change system it is literally impossible or on expense of freedom
“I am a bitch. Me too!”
"wow supporting an abuser, shame !"
Ambers a racist too !! How they feel about that ?
Poor black woman everyone picking on her.
Men are abused too.
"This kinda fucking ridiculous. One would expect her to support the victim, not the abuser. She was a victim herself, why the hell is she supporting AH? There is so much evidence against AH, it is obvious that she is the abuser."
"#Metoo movement means ""we are abused too"" NOT we are a woman too dumb dumb"
Plenty words no substance... Girl bye
What a beautiful and smart woman. The whole sistem is broken. I agree
"In the philosophical jargon, this is what's called a straw man argument. It assumes the possibility of some system of perfect justice, and finds the current system wanting in comparison. But there is no system of perfect justice - that's a straw man, and so the comparison is false. 
The Amber Heard verdict demonstrated that politically correct ideas like #believeallwomen - justified by the false comparison above, are wide open to abuse by liars - and so are themselves a source of injustice. 
This in turn explains in part why there can be no perfect system of justice. Because people lie; there must be doubt. Courts can only act upon what can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and oftentimes what's true cannot be proven true - so there can be no perfect system of justice.
These seem to me such obvious truths, I find it at least negligent, and at worst malicious that Burke does not take these considerations into account. This carelessness is characteristic of radical left wing thought; the same politically correct postmodernist neo marxist philosophy that sees Lia Thomas stealing sporting achievments from young women. The same characater of movement that would have you believe the police are engaged in racist genocide - despite statistical evidence to the contrary. The same underlying mode of thought that would have you believe slavery was invented by white people to oppress black people - when in fact slavery existed all around the world since the dawn of time, until Western civilization took a stand against it etc, etc.  
Freedom and justice - are not things that exist in nature, denied us by current systems; but rather, freedom and justice are are provided for imperfectly by systems devised by man. They don't always work; that's true. But the answer is to find ways to improve the system; because if we tear the system down, we will not free ourselves, but will wake to find ourselves in chains."
"People need to start understanding there is an invisible war between energy happening that dwells in the male and female that's been discussed in every religion in every region in one way or another better seen as the Ying and Yang. To tell it today these energys could be better recognized as the logic and the feeling. Males are the self or the individual, wile female's are connected through feeling having a universal face underneath the personality. Witch is why women threw out time have been seen as coming from male, or the clone, or the 2. Do to the universal face of feeling connecting them, that can be seen on the biological scale threw the gender itself. This also explains the difference between male and female threw ""progression"". Though men are not blameless and have created tyrants such as Hitler or Stalin. The male energy or ""individual"" is willing to rebell against itself to correct itself. Causing rebellion from within and around there organizations. Showing progression to free slaves, give women rights, and take our species multi plant and take us to Mars. Female dose not have this characteristic and are more selfish in nature then properly explained in this day in age explaining why they have only been able to progress itself even after 100 years of being out of their ""Oppression"". While using male energy to protect itself without giving anything in return. Again is why inside all women whether good or bad, the individual is always made to take the feeling. Yet feeling desires both. Showing the paradox of female the contradiction in feeling. This is also why threw out time in every religion female was never made to be in judgment. Even though now a days Judges are more female then male corrupting law male created. You can see that when the first female entered the justice system as a judge in the 1920's. Law slowly changed from logical arguments to magical words. Pushing the agenda of female confusion to all who comes under their judgment. Wile they preach its OK to change genders or how it's their body's to kill their kids no matter how far along they are. Instead of male self acceptance or life energy. Feeling was never made to rule itself, and women would be happier for it. The contradiction in confusion is not made to rule this world the individual of progression is. This is why we have single handedly destroyed humanity. Slowly without anyone knowing. This can also be seen through percentages witch should answer most questions. Our only hope I see for male's to pass this test is to cut off marriage as a whole, and do better logical vetting testing practices for Judges, wile doing the best to keep our male children with the male energy and females to their female energy."
"If we want change to happen.. it starts with us. We have some asinine  laws and our elected officials have their heads bury in the sand. I want to vote on term limits for all elected officials and judges. Since the President can only serve 2 terms, how about this standard for all elected officials state and federal and all judges."
"I believe Johnny Depp is definitely the victim here. He is a survivor of violence. He was abused and scared bigtime that has left him traumatized. And all of it perpetrated by the person who was supposed to love him, to protect him, to nurture him. That was his MOTHER. Amber Heard did not abuse Johnny Depp,  I am sorry about his fans, it must be hard for them realized it but it's true. It is uncomfortable to see that with your own eyes, you better denied it and find someone else to blame. I used to be Johnny Depps fan, It is been a loooong time I haven't liked a movie of him. Way before Amber. He became a cartoon of Jack Sparrow and I only saw Jack Sparrow from then on. It must have been very disappointing for Amber Heard to marry a person of this caliber and to just realize he was one person in the morning and another one at night. Always drugged and drunk and abusive,  but hey!   it is Johnny Depp and she had him on a pedestal. (Just like you guys JD fans). One can only go insane having to babysit an alcoholic actor, it's pathetic, he is almos 60 years old for God's sake!. She was not supposed to be doing that job. That is the biggest of Amber's mistakes. And it is not Amber's fault that Johnny was abused by his mom. Johnny should have taken his mom instead to court, long ago when he abused him and all of his siblings. It is sad what Amber's had been going through because if this trial but she has God on her side."
"Why don't they just change the name of their organization? I have a great name for it.. For real.. You could call it 
It's-Just- Us- Without- AH- Movement.. Because there no need to let One Bad Apple destroy the whole tree.. We all know that she was the rotten  little Apple at the bottom of the Fruit Basket..  So don't let her ruin y'all.."
me too movement seems like a broken guitar string like blm
The problem is they report the crime 23 years after it happened making it less believable
The reason why they scared to come out because they don't remember half of the stuff that they went through.
Here are two thoughts: one is assumed innocent until proven guilty….women are capable of lying. It’s not supposed to be easy to convict anybody of a serious crime.
"If a girl hooks up after drinking and then decides it was not consensual the next day because she was drunk and didn’t know any better… why can’t she do the same thing when she runs somebody over, while intoxicated??
In both cases, she said she was drunk and didn’t know any better"
"Absolute Respect to Johnny Depp. After all, he was brought to justice  -------'what all metoo followeers want for men-----  and this was a legal  decision. Those who don't agree are simply  against the law."
"Where is me too for the women on Oct. 7 & currently held hostage in Gaza? Is it because the war Hamas began & the world is angry at Israel for the bombings in Gaza where so many lives have been lost, that these women are forgotten because they’re Jewish? Is that what’s making you go silent now? Because of the backlash you’re going to get speaking up for these young women? Your movement took 10 steps forward. & now 10 steps back."
this movement was a business not justice
Why aren’t theses phonies standing up to the trans movement?
"In relation to the mo movement,  has se ual harassment and/or assault by law enforcement agents been addressed?   I am being sexually assaulted  using surveillance equipment as the weapon on a daily basis.   The weapon is piezoelectric and has capacity capabilities whi h means that it can apply pressure.   I've wakened to violent pounding of my vagina or rectum on multiple occasions. 



I assume that I am being investigated for something because my request for help from local law enforcement has been ignored.  Please respond.  Thanks."
Sharp?

Good
I lost so much respect for Johnny Depp with that trial. He acted so smug. The trial was a joke.

"Hätte nie gedacht, dass ich jemals eine Diskussion zwischen Silvi Carlsson, Desirée Nick und Ulf Poschardt sehe😅"
"Ich finds nach wie vor schade, dass das ZDF 13 Fragen nicht im Fernsehen ausstrahlt. Meiner Meinung nach eines der besten Diskussionsformate in Deutschland, regt mich immer wieder zum nachdenken an."
"Da wurde mir dann doch noch mal bewusst, in welcher Bubble ich mich befinde. Konnte das Video noch nicht ganz anschauen, weil ich mich soooo getriggert fühle. Das ist eine Klatsche ins Gesicht, was Desiree von sich gibt."
"""Ich identifiziere mich nicht als privilegiert"" war mein Favorit. Sie ist wahrscheinlich Millionärin die in der Öffentlichkeit steht. Wenn die nicht privilegiert ist was ist dann der Großteil der Gesellschaft"
"Silvi war ganz stark. Ich finde es so stark, dass sie als Betroffene so viel Contenence bei so viel Whataboutism, Ablenkung und mangelnder Empathie auf der anderen Seite halten kann. Ich bin in Gedanken bei allen Betroffenen, die dieses Video gucken und sich zurecht getriggert und nicht gehört fühlen! Ich glaube euch!"
"Hahaha, ich musste laut auflachen als die Schauspielerin meinte ""Jede Frau kann sagen ... bitte rufen sie mein Management an!"" Die ist sowas von weltfremd die glaubt jede Frau in der Arbeitswelt hat ein Management Team!"
"Es ist so einfach zu sagen ""ja lass es doch einfach nicht zu"". So einfach ist das nicht. Ich bin an sich ein sehr selbstbewusster Mensch jedoch ist mir das Blut in den Adern gefroren als mir jemand so zu nahe kam, ich habe mich so überrumpelt gefühlt, da kommt einem kaum in den Sinn sich in dem Moment zu behaupten. Da will man einfach nur weg und mit niemandem darüber reden."
"Mich hat die Me-too-Bewegung vor allem in dem Sinne beeinflusst, dass ich die Erfahrungen, die ich gemacht habe, nicht mehr selbst herunterspiele (war vielleicht gar nicht so schlimm, vielleicht bin ich zu empfindlich, meine Gefühle diesbezüglich sind evtl übertrieben).
Zu sehen, dass andere Personen es genauso bewerten wie mein inneres Gefühl hat mich bestärkt, den Mund aufzumachen.
Und als ich mich getraut habe, hat mein Arbeitgeber mich auch ernst genommen und vorbildlich gehandelt 👍🏻"
"Ich finde es ebenfalls realitätsfern von Frau Nick einfach davon auszugehen, dass alle anderen Menschen die gleiche Handlungsstruktur besitzen, wie sie nach außen. Ich bezweifle, dass sie in jeder SItuation in der Lage ist, sich zu wehren, sich abzugrenzen, ""einfach zu gehen"". Es wird immer jemanden geben, der die eigenen Grenzen nicht nur übertreten kann, sondern sie auch mit Gewalt eintritt. Das Glück gehabt zu haben, dies - auch wieder nach außen - nie erfahren haben zu müssen, vor allem als Frau, ist ein Privileg. Das ist nicht die Norm, das ist die Ausnahme. Und auch steckt dahinter keine Stärke, kein Mehrwert im eigenen Handeln, sondern einfach pures fucking Glück."
"Meine Erfahrung als 15 jährige Ferial-Praktikantin: Juniorchef um die 30 machte immer wieder Komplimente, die man lächelnd und unsicher annahm, dann einen Klaps auf den Po beim vorbeigehen, Einladungen zu Wein, die ich dankend ablehnte. 

Ich hab das nebenbei bei meinen Eltern erwähnt und war verwundert, dass mein Vater sofort zur Geschäftsleitung ging und ich dort nicht mehr arbeiten durfte. 

Erst Jahre später hab ich begriffen, dass genau dieses Verhalten des Juniorchefs übergriffig war. Und in kleinster weiße irgendwie entschuldbar."
"Ich habe mal als Flugbegleiterin gearbeitet und was ich da im Cockpit und bei Overnights so an sexueller Belästigung, unangenehmen Gesprächen, Missbrauch von Hierarchie usw. erlebt habe finde ich aus meiner heutigen Sicht absolut krass. Damals fand ich es auch unangenehm, aber ich konnte es nicht richtig einordnen und hab alles immer versucht schlagfertig zu kontern etc. Wenn ich das mal nicht geschafft habe, hab ich teilweise die Schuld bei mir gesucht, weil ich so ""unlocker"" bin. Heute würde ich solchen Situationen ganz anders begegnen, aber wenn man jung ist, dann hat man dieses Standing einfach noch nicht. Es muss noch einiges passieren, aber bitte ohne Krampf und die ständige Angst etwas falsches zu machen oder Männern generell keinerlei ""typisch männlichen Attribute"" zuzugestehen."
"Die Meinung von Desiree Nick finde ich sehr realitätsfern. Ich wurde von 18 bis 20 als duale Studentin in einem Hotel regelmäßig von meinem Chef (Ende 30) in Gesprächen am Arm festgehalten, während dem Sitzen an den Schultern massiert, für eine viel zu lange Zeit umarmt. Ich hatte dadurch das Gefühl, dass er seine Macht über mich demonstrieren wollte, was er auch geschafft hat. In diesen Situationen bin ich komplett handlungsunfähig gewesen, obwohl ich sonst eine Person bin, die sehr stark für sich einsteht. Da es in diesem Hotel keinen höheren Vorgesetzten, Betriebsrat oder ähnliches gegeben hat, an den ich mich hätte wenden können, blieb mich letztendlich nicht anderes als die Kündigung um mich dieser Situation zu entziehen. 
Das ganze ist jetzt zwei Jahre her und wenn ich mal über diese Erfahrung spreche, kommt mir oft Unverständnis entgegen. 
Von Personen wie Desiree Nick zu hören sich ""einfach nicht der Situation auszusetzen"" finde ich daher einfach nur schade.

Edit: Da es ja anscheinend sehr viele Meinungen mit SEHR vieler freier Interpretation zu meiner Situation gibt, konkretisiere ich das: Mein Chef war meines Erachtens ein Narzist. Nach meiner Kündigung hat er bis zu meinem letzten Arbeitstag nicht mehr mit mir gesprochen, mir nicht in die Augen gesehen, mir unschöne Aufgaben (Fugen der Hotelbadezimmer mit Zahnbürsten schrubben) erteilen lassen. In anderen Diskussionen (Mangel der Ausbildung, Arbeitssicherheit) zeigte er keinerlei Selbstreflexion oder Einsicht. Ich bin mir daher sicher, dass ich mit der Ansprache, dass ich dieser Berührungen nicht möchte, nichts positives erreicht hätte. 

ZUDEM hat er mich so stark festgehalten, dass danach Abdrücke am Arm zu sehen waren. Das war kein ""ich fasse meine Mitarbeiterin kurz freundschaftlich an, das empfindet sie bestimmt auch so"", sondern ein bewusst hartes zugreifen. Die Umarmungen waren entweder seitlich oder von hinten, es war nie so, als ob ich diese erwidert hätte oder gar von mir ausgingen. Ich musste ihn siezen, er duzte mich. Es gab keinerlei freundschaftliche Beziehung zwischen uns, die ein anfassen gerechtfertigt hätte. Selbst wenn das nicht der Fall gewesen wäre, hat ein Mensch bei einem Machtgefälle die Hände bei sich zu lassen. 

Und zur Erinnerung:  hier geht es um echte Menschen mit individuellen Erfahrungen, Charakterzügen und Emotionen. Eine Ferndiagnose ist nicht erwünscht. Wer nichts nettes zu meiner Erfahrung zu sagen hat, kann das gerne dem nächst gelegenen Baum erzählen :)"
"""Und daher möchte ich die Frauen bitten, sich dem ganzen nicht zur Verfügung zu stellen"" Bitte was? Wie sehr möchte man bitte sexuelle Übergriffe verharmlosen. Ich bin wirklich schockiert."
"Ich habe viele sexistische und sexuelle Übergriffe erlebt - vorallem aber in meinen Aushilfsjobs, bei denen ich das austauschsbarste Glied in der Kette war. Und ich kann berichten: egal wie oft ein übergriff stattgefunden hat, jedes mal war ich wie gelehmt. All die Schlagfertigkeit die mir sonst zugesprochen wurde, ist verschwunden. 

Ich habe mal als Kellnerin in einem Club gearbeitet. Standard Mainstreamschuppen. Als ich gerade Getränke auf dem Tisch abstellen wollte, griff mir ein Gast von hinten in den Schritt. Ich schoss hoch, schlug die Hand weg, konnte noch den Kopf schütteln und ging weg. Es ist nunmal nicht so, dass man sich auf so einen übergriff vorbereiten kann und dann Karate auspackt. Meine Schockreaktion war Flucht. Ich ging zum Türsteher um den Mann rausschmeißen zu lassen. Der Türsteher sagte zu mir ""naja Mäuschen, das kann schonmal passieren, das solltest du aushalten können, die menschen trinken hier eben"". Weil mir also von dem menschen, der mir helfen sollte nicht weitergeholfen wurde, ging ich zum Schichtleiter. Der meinte dann, die seien eben betrunken, so sei das in Clubs, ich hätte mich letztens schon beschwert weil mir einer zu nah gekommen sei und ich solle mich nicht so haben. Das großzügige Angebot vom Schichtleiter war dann noch dass ich den Tisch an einen Kollegen abgeben durfte. Dieser tat dann so als sei nichts gewesen. 

Mir wurde nicht geholfen, ich wurde nicht gehört. Ich wusste ich war nicht schuld, ich hatte einfach nur Getränke an einen Tisch gebracht. Mir wurde suggeriert ich wäre das problem, ich wäre anstrengend. Übrigens bin ich trotzdem zur nächsten Schicht erschienen. Ich brauchte den Job bis ich etwas neues hatte. Ich war angewiesen auf diese traurigen 8 euro die Stunde.

Ganz generell bin  ich selbstbewusst und bin ich Schlagfertig. Aber es geht um teils traumatische Situationen die oft schneller vorbei sind als man sie einordnen kann.

Silvi bleibt ruhig, wo ich nicht hätte ruhig bleiben können. Was die Nick da zum Teil von sich gibt konnte ich nicht glauben."
"Wie kann man als Frau dort stehen und den Frauen die Schuld daran geben, belästigt zu werden, weil sie es nicht geschafft haben ""ihr Berufs- und Privatleben zu trennen""!?! Dass Frau Nick sich nicht in Grund und Boden schämt..."
"Jede Frau kann einfach nein sagen... 
In den Situationen in denen ich noch sprechen konnte bevor ich dissoziiert bin, wurde mein nein mutwillig übergangen und ignoriert. Egal wie laut und deutlich es war, ob ich aus vollem Hals geschrien oder nur noch vor mich hin gewimmert habe.
Auch habe ich mich in vielen Situationen körperlich gewehrt. Sicherlich konnten damit einige Menschen aufgehalten werden... aber halt leider nicht alle.
Ich bin weder körperlich schwach noch habe ich zu wenig Selbstbewusstsein. 
Trotzdem wurde ich mehrfach sexuell belästigt und vergewaltigt. 
Aber danke für die Tipps, das nächste mal werde ich einfach nein sagen und mich nicht in die Opferposition begeben."
Ich finde Desiree Nick absolut Respektlos und Verständnisslos gegenüber Menschen die nicht in ihrer Position sind.
"Frau Nick spielt ihre altbekannte Rolle. Wie immer mehr schlecht als recht, weil man bei ihr immer deutlich merkt, wie wenig dahinter steckt. Das macht eine ernsthafte Diskussion mit ihr unmöglich."
"Allerherzlichsten Dank an Caroline Rosales, Silvi Carlsson und Fikri Anil Altintas. Klasse, bin ich froh, um eure Arbeit."
"44:58 ""Was nicht passieren darf, ist dass man es zur Sache der Frauen macht. Das ist grotesk. Es ist das Thema der Männer.""
Ich finde, dass ist ein sehr wichtiger Punkt."
"Ich stimme den Kommentaren hier zu, dass es nicht immer so leicht ist nein zu sagen. Darüberhinaus wird einem häufig auch gar nicht die Möglichkeit gegeben sich irgendwie zu äußern, sondern man wird in einer oder mehreren Hinsichten unterdrückt und da raus zu kommen ist um einiges schwerer, weil dir nicht zugehört wird. Ich finde es schade, dass dieses Argument so groß zu sein scheint. Wenn dich jemand beispielsweise sexuell belästigt, gibt dir die Person in vielen Fällen gar nicht erst die Chance überhaupt nein zu sagen geschweige denn irgendeine Entscheidung zu treffen ob du einverstanden bist mit dem was passiert. Da fällt diese Frage ""Warum sagst du denn nicht nein?"" vollkommen weg. Es gibt Übergriffe aller Art in allen Bereichen wo du lange Zeit gar nicht die Chance bekommst ja oder nein zu sagen.
Außerdem, wie schon oft betont wurde: warum müssen wir lernen in übergriffigen Situationen noch lauter nein zu sagen? Sollten nicht lieber Menschen in Machtpositionen etc. lernen sich gar nicht erst übergriffig zu verhalten?"
"Ein Kern Punkt ist, dass viele Menschen ""Priviligierung"" als Vorwurf ansehen und vor Allem Männer meinen, dass sie etwas dafür könnten. Darum geht es nicht. Es geht um ein Bewusstsein in was für einer Situation man sich befindet und daran zu arbeiten, dass sich was ändert. Nehmt das nicht als Front gegen Euch persönlich, gefrontet könnt ihr nur werden, wenn Ihr nix draus macht."
"Alle schreiben hier Desiree ist tough und selbstbewusst.. klar, kann sie ja für sich sein. Aber ich finde es absolut nicht fair von sich auf andere zu schließen, gerade da es in dieser Debatte eben NICHT um Menschen in ihrer Position geht. Ihre Aussagen in dieser Sendung sind ein Schlag ins Gesicht all derer Frauen, die anders als sie leider keine andere Wahl hatten.

Abgesehen davon, finde ich den Rest, den sie hier angesprochen hat richtig und gut!"
"Am Ende des Tages wollen wir doch alle in einer Gesellschaft leben, wo man sich sicher fühlen kann und Spaß haben kann... egal welches Geschlecht... ich hoffe wir schaffen dies irgendwann für alle möglich zu machen!"
"es ist halt zu undifferenziert zu behaupten, dass man ja einfach nein sagen könnte. Wenn man Jahre lang studiert hat und dann endlich einen Job hat, den man auch machen will und mag und dann jemand, der über dir steht, dir dein Leben zur Hölle machen kann und dich im schlimmsten Fall sogar entlassen kann, dich anmacht o.ä. sollte man nicht den Frauen ein geändertes Verhalten abverlangen, sondern denjenigen, die in diesen Machtpositionen sind."
"Es tut mir so unendlich Leid,ich schaue seit 6 Minuten,aber sehe es nicht ein,mich weiter von Desirée Nick anschreien zu lassen. Ihre ersten zwei Aussagen,zeigen mir schon,dass dies ein hofflungsloser Fall ist..wer zum Teufel dachte,es wäre eine gute Idee so jemanden bei so einem Thema einzuladen???"
"Ich habe es zu Hauf erlebt in meinem Beruf als Sekretärin, dass ich von Männern einfach angefaßt wurde oder auf übelste Art und Weise ""angemacht"" wurde, obwohl ich keinerlei Anstalten gemacht hatte, was auf Zuspruch oder Aufforderung meinerseits hätte gewertet werden können. Und wenn ein Vorgesetzter mir einfach seine Hand auf den Po legt, dann ist das ja bereits geschehen, also das mißbräuchliche Verhalten hat schon stattgefunden. Ich kann dann zwar noch sagen: ""unterlassen Sie das"" oder andere Sachen, nur PASSIERT ist es dann bereits, sprich meine Sicherheitszone ist dann bereits verwundet worden."
"Konnte die Folge leider nicht vollständig schauen, weil mich die Aussagen von Desirée Nick unfassbar getriggert haben. Einfach nur respektlose und realitätsferne Aussagen."
"Silvi, gut, dass wir dich haben!"
"Ich finde Silvie sehr stark. Desiree Nick hingegen hat nichts zu sagen und ich hab das Gefühl, sie will nur spalten."
"Man merkt wieder einmal, Frau Nick lebt in ihrer eigenen Welt. Mittlerweile denke ich, dass es wirklich hoffnungslos ist mit ihr eine vernünftige Diskussion zu führen. Sie ist so fern ab von allem, was irgendwen anderen außer ihr betrifft. Kann ihr Management ihr nicht bitte mal erzählen, was für einen Schwachsinn sie von sich gibt. Da kann man ja kaum zuhören ohne auszurasten..."
Ganz stark von Silvie! 👏
"Na klar, JEDE FRAU hat die Möglichkeit zu sagen: ""bitte rufen Sie mein Management an"". Sicher, ich fange als 16jährige auf dem Dorf in einer Bäckerei an und mein Chef wird übergriffig. Frau Nick will mir jetzt sagen, ich betrachte das Verhältnis einfach nicht als rein professionell, der Mann könnte ja auch mein Gärtner sein, ich wäre nicht selbstbewusst genug und um so besser, wenn mir der Mann gefällt. Völliger Realitätsverlust."
"Emotionale Diskussion - ich finde es super, dass die Standpunkte und Menschen, die diskutieren, sehr vielseitig sind. Die Moderation ist super und ich glaube, dass solche Formate sehr wichtig und bereichend sind. 

Miteinander sprechen, auch wenn man nicht auf einer Seite steht :)"
"Ich möchte nur anmerken: die Bilder fast aller Kameras waren angenehm ruhig, bis auf die der Kamera, die die Naheinstellungen der Personen auf dem grünen Feld aufnahm. Ihre Bilder waren mir störend und ablenkend verwackelt. Da habe ich mir mehr Ruhe in der Kameraführung gewünscht."
Silvis Gesichtsausdruck bei min 8:18 widerspiegelt einfach genau meinen HAHAHAH
"Desiree Nick ist so respektlos da fällt mir nichts mehr ein, aber das sehe ich bei vielen Menschen ihrer Generation und das ist sehr schade."
"Warum muss Desiree Nick  so laut und aggressiv reden? Ich sehe dieses Format so gerne und habe bis jetzt alle Themen gesehen, aber noch niemand ist so unangenehm wie diese Frau aufgefallen... Sie kann sich überhaupt nicht in die Frauen hineinversetzen, die in manchen Situationen hilflos sind und nicht wissen wie sie reagieren sollen und vor allem können..."
"Ich denke, dass es eher die Seltenheit ist, wenn eine Frau solche Erfahrungen nicht gemacht hat."
"@13 Fragen, ich finde ihr macht eine Super Sendung und ihr leistet damit echt einen wichtigen Beitrag gegen die Spaltung in der Gesellschaft. Könntet ihr mal ein Video zum Thema Psychiatrie machen? Z.B, ob schneller eingewiesen werden sollte, oder ob Zwangsmaßnahmen verboten werden sollten!? Arbeite selber in dem Bereich und habe da viele spannende Diskussion schon zu erlebt.Liebe Grüße"
"Als junger Mann bin ich tatsächlich immer sehr schockiert von sowas zu hören, dass Frauen ggf. sogar ihren Job verlieren könnten, wenn sie bei sowas nicht mit mache. Ich habe auch von Kommilitoninnen öfter z.B. Berichte über Catcalling gehört, was ja ebenfalls gesellschaftliche Verhältnisse widerspiegelt. Ich finde es auch gut, dass ganz allgemein solche Themen jetzt öffentlich(er) diskutiert werden, was vorher so nicht der Fall war.

Ich glaube aber daran, dass in der langen Frist sich die Gesellschaft dahingehend ändern wird, viele in meinem Alter, ich bin jetzt Anfang 22, sind generell für solche Sachen sensibilisiert und würden solche Dinge als Chef gar nicht mehr zustande kommen lassen. Dass Frauen für ihre Rechte eintreten, auch wenn leider nicht jede Frau dazu in der Lage ist, würde diesen Prozess natürlich erheblich beschleunigen.

Ich hoffe in gewisser Weise auch, ohne jetzt genauere Zahlen zu kennen, dass heute, also 2020+, sowas generell nicht mehr so oft vorkommt, viele Berichte und Erfahrungen dazu bezogen sich auf Dinge, die vor min. 5, teilweise erheblich mehr Jahren passiert sind und erst jetzt die Frauen dazu bereit waren darauf aufmerksam zu machen, sowas generell vielleicht heute sowas nicht mehr so oft stattfindet. Auch wenn jeder einzelne Fall natürlich einer zu viel ist.

Generell sollte man nur, dass musste ich z.B. in solche Diskussionen leider auch lernen, man wird auch als Mann teilweise in eine Aggressoren Rolle gedrängt, so geframed, als sei man selbst auch Teil des Problems. Rein strukturell mag das der Fall sein, ja, aber es trifft halt nicht auf jeden Einzelnen zu.
Ich für meinen Teil wähle z.B. gezielt den Beruf des Lehrers, weil ich weiß, dass hier solche Chef-Mitarbeiterin-Konstellation einfach nicht wirklich auftritt, sowas wie Geschäftsessen zwischen jungen Lehrerinnen und Direktoren wären mir z.B. neu. Und das, ohne mich jetzt in eine Opferrolle schieben zu wollen, die in keinem Verhältnis zu der Rolle der Frauen steht, ist halt einfach wirklich scheiße, wenn man halt Vorwürfe an den Kopf geschmissen bekommt und sich eigentlich nur denkt ""Was habe ich jetzt konkret damit zu tun? Ich war bisher noch in keiner Machtposition, werde es als Lehrer ggü. Kolleginnen einfach nicht sein, will ich auch gar nicht, und Schülerinnen leiden unter dem gleichen Machtgefälle, wie ihre Mitschüler, mal von sexualisierter Gewalt die von einzelnen Lehrern ausgeht abgesehen."""
"Wie unsympathisch willst du sein?
Desiree Nick: Ja!"
Schon komisch das der Altersunterschied der gelben und grünen Seite so hoch ist. Vielleicht ist da ja doch ein Zusammenhang zwischen der Meinung und dem Alter
Wieso fragt man Desiree überhaupt… diese Frau lebt so fernab von Realität und empathielos
"Ich glaube, was sich verändert hat, ist, dass viele Menschen sich in sozialen Rahmen eher trauen, Erfahrungen zu teilen, juristisch ist meiner Meinung nach überhaupt nichts passiert. Was ich allerdings auch oft erlebe, ist, dass gerade Männer unglaublich krass auf solche Erfahrungsberichte reagieren und sofort auf den Begriff ""Rufmord"" kommen"
"Einfach DANKE an Caroline Rosales, Fikri Anıl Altıntaş und Silvi Carlsson!!!!"
"Falls es niemandem ab Minute 39:21 aufgefallen ist, Desiree Nick ist nur nicht nach vorne gekommen, da die Moderatorin das Wort „Anfang“ falsch ausgesprochen hat und man gemerkt hat, dass Desiree dies zweimal versucht hat zu korrigieren. 
Natürlich in Ordnung ein Wort zu korrigieren, jedoch denke ich dass die Moderatorin sich bewusst ist,dass das Wort „Anfang - Anfang“ heißt und nicht „Amfang“. 
Sehr unterschwellig von der Frau Nick."
"Frau Nick hat offensichtlich ihr Selbstbewusstsein mit der Muttermilch aufgesogen. Es gibt jedoch Frauen, die dieses Privileg nicht hatten...
Ernsthaft, ich verstehe, was sie meint, jedoch fehlt mir hier (wieder mal) ihre Einsicht, dass nicht jede Frau so charakterfest, so stark in der Widerrede ist bzw. in der Lage ist, sich verbal & körperlich zu wehren. Es gibt Situationen, wo frau vollkommen überfordert, weil überfahren wird...
Ich, ich, ich.... So relevant kann ihre Meinung hier nicht sein, es geht auch um Empathie."
"Was ich schwer zu greifen finde ist wo fängt victim blaming an und wo der juristische Unschuldsgedanke des Angeschuldigten? Nicht jede Anschuldigung ist wahr. Kommt dieses erst zu spät heraus entsteht für tatsächlich betroffene Frauen ein noch größerer Schaden, den es wird ihnen dann noch mehr Misstraut als aktuell, was wiederum in noch mehr Leid für sie endet."
"Ich glaube die MeToo-Bewegung soll vor allem das Thema sensibilisieren und wie Silvi sagt auch zu Empathie führen. 
Zumindest würde ich mir das wünschen, dass Personen in Machtpositionen selbst nun mehr darüber nachdenken, wann sie (bewusst oder auch unbewusst) ihre Macht missbrauchen, Angestellte einengen und zu dem Entschluss kommen, dass bestimmte Verhaltensweisen daher nicht angebracht sind.  Im gleichen Zuge wünsche ich mir durch mehr Sensibilität auch Unterstützung von Kolleg*innen in akuten Situationen - sexistische Kommentare und Handlungen sollten direkt als solche benannt und kritisiert werden, wenn man sie als Bystander mitbekommt. Menschen müssen lernen, dass bereits sexistische Äußerungen absolut unangebracht und respektlos sind. 

Mehr Empathie wünsche ich mir auch - es sollte darum gehen die Notlage von Betroffenen anzuerkennen und diese nicht mit Vorwürfen zu überschütten oder gar dort die Verantwortung zu suchen. Täter*innen ist egal, ob man ""nein"" sagt oder es signalisiert - wer seine Macht bis zu so einem Vorfall ausnutzt, wird sie weiter ausnutzen (""Wer wird dir schon glauben?"")...."
Gott es ist kaum auszuhalten was die Desiree spricht 🙈 absolut fern jeglicher Realität.
"Im Grunde ist doch die Frage, ob juristisch und gesellschaftlich die Unschuldsvermutung gelten soll. Ich bin der Meinung, man sollte empathisch gegenüber Allen sein und als außenstehende Person im Zweifel einfach neutral bleiben. Vorverurteilungen und Selbstjustiz in egal welche Richtung ist schwachsinnig."
"Desiree sagt, sie könne ja Privatleben von Berufsleben trennen. Aber in der Diskussion geht es doch gerade darum, was ist, wenn es zB dein Vorgesetzter nicht kann/will. Wenn er sich einer Angestellten aufdrängt, obwohl sie alles rein professionell halten will. Was mache ich dann? Ich glaube, nicht jeder ist in der Position zu sagen „Na hören Sie mal, werden Sie mal nicht frech“ oder „Pah, dann geh ich jetzt einfach“, dann ist der Job vielleicht weg. Und nicht jeder kann das verkraften."
"Ich finde die Diskussion sehr gut geführt und super interessant und wichtig !
So gut wie jede Partei hat super argumentiert. Jedoch fand ich Desire schrecklich unpassend. Evtl weil ich sie nach ihrem Sommerhaus der Stars Auftritt nicht erst nehmen kann in so einer wichtigen Diskussion, da sie einfach in einer privilegierten Bubble lebt und nur Ich-bezogen sich hier dargestellt hat."
Sieht für mich stark danach aus das Me too auch ein Generationen Thema ist. Ist zumindest auffällig das die jungen Leute auf einer und die älteren auf der anderen Seite stehen.
"Beim Bachelor Format ist es doch so, dass Frauen sich selbstbestimmt anmelden, um, um einen Mann zu kämpfen und sich im TV zu zeigen. Wo passt der Vergleich denn in die Metoo Debatte? Das verstehe ich leider nicht :( desweiteren fühle ich sehr mit Silvi mit."
"""Die Kardashians haben die Welt verändert und sind glaube ich meilen weiter..."" 😂hat sie das wirklich gesagt? Mein Gedanke dazu: Nein, einfach nur nein😆🤦🏽‍♂️"
"Frauen sollten viel mehr für sich und ihre Prinzipien einstehen. Ich selber schließe mich da nicht aus. Ich musste dies auch erst lernen, dass ich bestimme, wo es lang geht. Das heißt nicht, das Straftaten und sexuelle Belästigung verharmlost werden sollten. Ich wünsche aber mehr Frauen das Selbstbewusstsein von Frau Nick oder Silvi. Denn ich kann mich durchaus durchsetzen, aber im öffentlichen Raum sich zu positionieren finde ich beeindruckend!

Ich möchte nochmal unterstreichen, dass ich natürlich gegen Victim blaming bin. Nur, wenn nicht wir Frauen ganz klar die Grenze ziehen, wer tut es dann für uns!?"
"Bin so froh, dass Samra auch in dem Zusammenhang genannt wurde, habe sehr oft das Gefühl, dass er nicht als Täter und vor allem Nika nicht als Opfer anerkannt werden."
"Die Nick kann man sich auch echt nicht mehr geben. Ich habe das mal als Selbstbewusstsein gesehen, es ist aber meiner Meinung nach nur noch Arroganz. Ich finde, Silvi hat ihre Meinung stark und respektvoll vertreten und man sieht ihr an, wie schwer ihr das teilweise fällt. Der Kontrast zwischen den beiden ist beeindruckend und zeigt, auf was für ein Niveau man manchmal trifft, wenn man über diese Themen sprechen will."
"Danke, dass ihr diesem Thema eine Plattform gebt! 💙"
"Ich bin durch das Video noch nicht komplett durch, mir fehlt aber eindeutig die Rolle der Männer. Gerade in der ersten Hälfte geht es viel darum, wie sich Betroffene verhalten und ihre Erfahrungen nach außen tragen. Diese Themen sind natürlich sehr wichtig, hier hat sich bereits etwas getan und es muss noch mehr geschehen, keine Frage.
Aber die Tatsache, dass nicht erwähnt wird, dass das übergreifende Verhalten der Männer das Hauptproblem ist, finde ich ein wenig schade. Unsere Gesellschaft, die über unangebrachte Kommentare noch mit ""Männer halt"" reagiert, ist doch eigentlich das Hauptproblem und hier hat sich meiner Meinung nach trotz #metoo noch gar nichts getan.

Wie immer super interessantes Video!"
"Klar hat Desiree Nick recht, wenn sie sagt, dass eine Frau frei bestimmen kann, ob sie mit dem Mann Essen gehen will oder nicht. Nur vergisst die alte Dame, dass nicht jeder so viel Selbstbewusstsein geschnuppert hat wie sie.
Wenn man z.b. kein Selbstwertgefühl hat, kann das ganz schön schwierig sein und es kommt zu Gedanken wie ""Vielleicht hab ich es nicht anders verdient"". Es braucht Arbeit und Geduld, um zu verstehen, dass man gar nichts muss, aber dafür muss man auch bewusst und aktiv am Selbstwertgefühl arbeiten."
"ich bin auch in der privilegierten Position, dass ich im Berufsalltag nie in eine solche Situation gekommen bin. Im Privatumfeld hingegen schon. Daher kann ich mir vorstellen wieviel Druck auf einem lastet, vor allem als junge Person, um es dem Chef Recht zu machen. Und ich denke auch nicht, dass es von 0 auf 100 geht und der einen direkt in de Abstellraum zerrt. Ich denke eher, dass ist so über viele Wochen hinweg, erst eine Hand auf dem Rücken, dann mal ein Meeting kurz vor Feierabend und es ist fast niemand mehr im Büro, sodass man sich sicher fühlt. Und dann wird es aufdringlicher und aufdringlicher und ich man überlegt sich ""ist das jetzt schon ein Übergriff?"" Ich kann mich jedenfalls an einen Chef erinnern, bei dem ich als Praktikantin gearbeitet habe, wo ich ein ganz mulmiges Gefühl hatte. Der wollte immer die Tür schließen bei jeder Besprechung, egal wie banal. Der hat mich Aufgaben doppelt und dreifach machen lassen, nur um zu sehen wie ich mich darüber ärgere. Ich bin froh, dass ich da nach einem Monat weg war, aber ich kann mir gut vorstellen, dass so jemand Stück für Stück probiert die Kontrolle zu übernehmen. Ich komme mir dann doof vor, wenn ich als Praktikantin sage ""dir Tür bleibt offen"", dann unterstelle ich ihm ja etwas."
"Was irgendwie nie angesprochen wird wenn es um die Unschuldsvermutung geht: die gilt für das Opfer doch genauso, jemanden fälschlich wegen etwas anzuzeigen, das er nicht gemacht hat, ist genauso eine Straftat."
"Gute, wichtige und interessante Diskussion. Nur Frau Nick halte ich in dieser Runde für komplett überflüssig. Sie hat leider nichts begriffen, senkt das Niveau und es mangelt ihr an Empathie."
"33:11 Absolut wahre Worte - sehr gut, dass er das endlich mal aufklärt: Toxische Männlichkeit vs. ÜBERmännlichkeit. Ich kann den Begriff ""Toxische Männlichkeit"", den jeder heute nur noch nachplappert, weil er ""hip"" klingt, nicht mehr hören. Männlichkeit in ihrer gesunden, ausbalancierten Form ist etwas Wunderbares, genauso wie ""toxische Weiblichkeit"" (Übersexualisierung der eigenen Person oder Gluckenhaftigkeit) etwas UNangenehmes sein kann. Männer benötigen für ein gesundes psychisches Wachstum als Kinder Liebe und Wertschätzung (wie jedes Kind natürlich) - eine starke, emotional verfügbare Vaterfigur, die dennoch liebevoll und warm ist - das wird noch viel Zeit benötigen, bis die Kriegstraumata der vergangenen Generationen geheilt sind und damit die Öffnung des Mannes hin zur Wärme und Herzlichkeit + Offenheit, über Gefühle zu sprechen, gedeihen können."
Silvie war hier so stark!
"@Silvi Carlsson ist einfach nur eine Mood, ihre Blicke und und Mimiken sind einfach nur relatable. Vor allem, wenn man weiss, dass sie mehr Ahnung hat als andere."
Silvi war einfach toll. Danke für deinen Einsatz!
danke Anil für deine starken und wahren Worte
"Desiree Nick ist so unangenehm...dass sie nicht mal anerkennt, wie privilegiert sie ist und wie sie sich dann so frauenverachtend äußert. Unglaublich! Auch die Art ud Weise, wie sie diskutiert.. muss echt nicht sein die Frau!"
"8:19 SILVI, ich FÜHLE es, ich fühle es!!!"
Ralf bönt war definitiv der einzige der wirklich differenziert disskutieren kann über dieses thema
"Tolles Video, sehr wichtiges Thema. Hätte mir nur gerne die Endrésumés von allen 6 Debattenteilnehmern gewünscht. Ich finde vor allem diese besonders spannend und wichtig."
"Im Servis , zum Beispiel in einer Bar,erlebte ich es alltäglich,da kommt noch der Alkohol dazu fallen die Hemmungen.ich habe mir an jedem Ort den Respekt erkämpfen müssen,wir in solchen Berufen müssen denm anderen Geschlecht schon noch die Stirn bieten  Da es so ist dass Männer jagen und die Frau entscheidet wie weit es geht , müssen wir zusammen sexuelle andeutungen gerade laut aussprechen, gerade blosstellen,keine Zeit vergehen lassen...wehrt euch 💃auch Männer sind betroffen ,Frauen haben dieses Machtgetue auch drauf.Auch einmischen wenn es irgendwie gefühlt wird ,,wo fängts an ,,jeder und jede kennt die Grenze,es wird in Sekundenschnelle gefphlt ganz klar ,danke gutes Thema"
"Schweres Thema, ich kann beide Seiten verstehen. Aber wenn ich in einem Betrieb arbeite, wo ich mit den Chefs essen gehen muss um nicht meinen Job zu verlieren, möchte ich (nur persönlich ich!) gar kein Teil des Betriebs mehr sein weil ich sowas nicht vertrete. Ich möchte 100% meinen Betrieb vertreten können und mit gutem Gewissen sagen können „der Betrieb ist sehr gut“. Sonst ist doch gutes Arbeiten nicht möglich."
"Das scheint ein Generationen Konflikt zu sein oder? Spannend wäre mal zu schauen, wie das Bild innerhalb der Generationen aussehen würde 🤔 Wirklich tolle und wichtige Diskussion, ich stimme beiden Positionen in manchen Punkten zu 🤔"
Silvi ich fühle jede deiner Reaktionen
"Ufff, das war echt hart mitanzugucken!"
Poschardt ist wunderbar vernünftig und gelassen. Er argumentiert rhetorisch und inhaltlich sauber. Danke dafür!
"Mit persönlich sind in meinem Berufsleben überwiegend höfliche, aber zumindest respektvolle Männer begegnet"
"Eigentlich eine schöne Diskussion (finde euer Format generell super!) und viele Gäste, deren Einstellung ich trotz unterschiedlicher Meinungen irgendwie nachvollziehen konnte. Aber Désirée Nick war wirklich schwer zu ertragen. Natürlich ist es wichtig verschiedensten Positionen Raum zu bieten, nach ihrem Auftritt hier würde ich jedoch wirklich dafür plädieren dieser Frau hier  und generell in den öffentlichen Medien keinen Raum mehr zu geben. Ihre Schuldzuweisungen den Opfern von sexuellem Missbrauch gegenüber waren absolut menschenverachtend und sind ein Schlag in das Gesicht einer jeden Frau (oder Mann) die solche Erfahrungen machen musste. Sie hat die Diskussion argumentativ nicht bereichert und betreibt eine völlig narzisstisch anmutende Form der Selbstdarstellung- und Inszenierung. Es gibt genug gebildete, aufgeweckte Menschen mit interessanten Erfahrungen und Meinungen in dieser Gesellschaft, da müssen wir dieser Person nun wirklich keine Bühne mehr bieten!"
"Ich fand MeToo super. Bis der Begriff verwässert worden war und jeder schiefe Blick und jedes unglückliche Kompliment (ja, nicht jeder ist ein rhetorischer Vollprofi) gleich als ""MeToo"" hochstilisiert wurde."
"Laengst ueberfaellig diese metoo bewegung. Habe selbst viel erfahrrung mit solchen maennern gemacht. Schlimm ist es,wenn es den job betrifft auf den man gerade angewiesen ist. Frauen brauchen viel mehr Respekt und anerkennung"
"Ralf Bönt hat die Situation von Männern sehr gut erklärt, zu diesem Ergebnis kam im übrigen auch eine Frau namens Vera Birkenbihl."
"Das war die erste Debatte, die mir hier wirklich nicht gefallen hat. Desiree Nick ist für ihre provokante und oft sehr konfrontative Art doch bekannt, das finde ich in einem solchen Format absolut fehl am Platz."
"Silvie, einfach nur ein Engel!"
alter die Frau auf der gelben Seite geht ja mal garnicht
"Frau Nick, natürlich kann ich nein sagen. Aber das Problem ist doch, dass die Frage überhaupt im Raum steht! 
Dass man sich überhaupt Sorgen machen muss, seinen Job zu verlieren wenn man nicht mit dem Chef essen geht, das das Angebot überhaupt gemacht wird, das alleinig ist das Problem."
"Die Beispiele finde ich sehr kritisch, weil es noch keine Rechtsprechung zu den Fällen gibt. Das ist eine Vorverurteilung - bei der ich seit dem Fall Kachelmann sehr, sehr vorsichtig geworden bin.
Wenn es der Frau passiert ist, dann sind die Verurteilungen oft noch sehr niedrig in Deutschland. Würde mir nur wünschen, dass die Medien sich da raus halten und diese Diskussion nicht öffentlich geführt wird, sondern vor Gericht gelöst wird."
"Bestes aktuelles Beispiel ist ja jetzt Snoop Dogg, da ist ja jetzt interessant, ob und wenn wann da irgendwelche Konsequenzen für ihn entstehen werden."
"Für mich gibt es in dieser Debatte immer nur 2 Seiten: Sie ist doch selbst verantwortlich und hätte jederzeit nein sagen können. Oder: Sie hatte keine Chance und Männer müssen jetzt erkennen dass sie was ändern müssen mit Bezug auf toxische Männlichkeit. 

Für mich liegt die Lösung wie immer in der Mitte dazwischen: Es ist unbestritten so, dass ich mir die Situation unfassbar deprimierend und frustrierend vorstelle, durch ein Essen mit dem Chef dass in keiner Weise aus genuiner Motivation entsteht (um hier die ""harmloseste"" der im Video genannten Nötigungen als Beispiel aufzugreifen) meinen Job sichern zu müssen. Das sind Zustände die auf jeden Fall geändert werden müssen. Dennoch muss das Argument gelten können: Wenn ein Job, egal wie lukrativ, welche Aufstiegschancen und welches Prestige er bringt, Dinge mit sich bringt die so starke Übergriffe, die potentiell traumatisch sind, beeinhalten, muss die psychische Selbstfürsorge im Vordergrund stehen. Ein großes Problem in diesem Zusammenhang ist zum einen dass ein Großteil der Frauen schon im frühen Kindesalter dazu konditioniert werden, Probleme mit dem Setzen von klaren Grenzen zu bekommen. Die alten physisch basierten Geschlechterrollen sind in den meisten Familien psychologisch leider noch sehr stark ausgeprägt. Genau so verhält es sich mit dem kalkulierten Grenzüberschreiten und  Sich-durchsetzen bei Männern. Nun sehe ich ein großes Problem in dem Terminus toxische Männlichkeit. Damit wird impliziert dass die Verantwortung für ein Umdenken allein bei Vertretern des männlichen Geschlechts zu suchen ist. Man stelle sich im Umkehrschluss vor man würde die Unfähigkeit zum klaren Setzen von Grenzen als toxische Weiblichkeit bezeichnen. Für mich wäre ein Ansatz dass man schon in der frühkindlichen Konditionierung bei beiden Geschlechtern die heutigen Probleme im Auge hat und denen entgegen wirkt ohne dabei mit dem Finger auf eine Seite zu zeigen und zu sagen: Du wirst mal das Problem sein."
"Desirée Nick: ""Ich würde es nicht privilegiert nennen ich nenne es selbstbewusst"" ahhhh
Ihr Selbstbewusstsein ist ein Privileg. Keine Ahnung wie ihre Kindheit/Vergangenheit war, aber wenn sie ein Umfeld/Personen hatte die sie unterstützten und ihr dadurch geholfen haben überhaupt zu einer so Selbstsicheren Person die Boundaries setzen kann zu werden, dann ist das ein Privileg"
"Man sollte doch manchmal daran denken, dass es etwas völlig anderes ist sich eine Situation vorzustellen oder wirklich in soeiner zu stecken. Mir sind schon viele Dinge passiert in denen ich unbeholfen war/ komisch reagiert habe usw die ich mir so niemals vorstellen könnte. Die meisten würden doch denken, dass sie sich wehren wenn jemand ihnen ein leid antun möchte. Aber realität ist dass das nicht jeder kann. Man ist perplex/ blind vor liebe/ finanziel oder sozial abhängig von jemandem / völlig eingeschüchtert.. da reagiert man nicht mehr wie man das im normalfall vlt gern hätte"
Das ist wahnsinnig jetzt muss man sich von einem älteren Mann sagen lassen ob Frauen belästigst werden oder nicht
Super starkes Video! Dennoch kann man manchmal nur den Kopf schütteln über Aussagen der  gelben Seite.
"Was ich neben Desiree Nick besonders bezeichnend fand, war der Kommentar von wegen ""Hat sich ja schon viel getan, das wird ja überhaupt nicht toleriert."" Aber jede Frau und jedes Mädchen weiß, dass wir viel zu oft im Alltag sexistische Sachen mitbekommen. Wie oft werden Witze über Themen wie Vergewaltigung, SA und allgemeinen Sexismus gemacht, über die auch noch gelacht werden? 
So lange, wie andere Männer daneben stehen und mitlachen oder sich nicht explizit dagegen aussprechen, wird das toleriert!"
"Frau Nick macht es sich da zu einfach und schiebt die Schuld wieder den Frauen zu... nicht jede Frau hat gelernt ihre Grenzen zu ziehen und sich hier so klar zu positionieren... ich musste auch erst lernen selbstbewusst und bestimmt Grenzen zu ziehen und Männer zurecht zu weisen, wenn sie mir zB zu nahe kommen. Gerade junge Mädchen können mit solchen Dingen oft nicht umgehen und lassen dann vielleicht Dinge zu, die sie gar nicht möchten. Aber ich gebe ihr soweit recht, dass jeder Mensch und vor allem jedes Mädchen lernen sollte, diese Grenzen zu ziehen. Ich als Pädagogin kann sagen, dass die Erziehung der Kinder sich zumindest in diesem Punkt in eine positive Rihtung bewegt... Stichwort Selbstbestimmung, offnere Kommunikation über Themen wie Sexualität, Grenzen usw..."
"I close my eyes and listen to his voice, it instantly takes me back to a simpler and I think better times. Thank you sir."
"35-years ago on a Saturday morning, I drove my mother to LAX where she flew to the North Dakota family farm for a reunion with five of her remaining siblings that once numbered twelve.  When I saw her off, little did I know that Garrison Keillor would fatefully change my plans.

Born and raise in Los Angeles, I grew up in the 1950's and 60's and I was sent back every other summer to work on my grandparents farm with them, a German bachelor uncle and a widowed aunt.  I really enjoyed those summers and In those days the local North Dakota small towns of Oriska and Tower City were were a mirror of what would later become Garrison's vision of Lake Wobegon.

I had thought about flying back with my mother to be with everyone at this reunion. But I was busy at work and decided not to.  That Saturday night after earlier seeing my mother off,  I was working in my garage and listening to Garrison Keillor's PHC when he started his News from Lake Wobegon story.   It was about a family reunion at a farm house to celebrate an elderly aunt's birthday. Garrison noted she was so thin and frail that you could see light through her hands.....a perfect description of my widowed aunt.   I stopped what I was doing and there were tears in my eyes as he finished the story and ended the show. 

I then walked into the house and told my wife I needed to go to that reunion and made reservations to fly out the next day.  After calling my boss Sunday morning I flew to Fargo and rented a car.  Before heading out the last leg of the drive to the farm I stopped at the Tower City Cafe and Truck Stop and had a Walleye dinner with a piece of fresh rhubarb pie for desert.

When I arrived at the family farm I walked into the kitchen and saw my mother and her siblings sitting at the table talking and drinking coffee.  I hadn't told them I was coming and one of my aunts said ""Curtis, what are you doing here?"" My mother looked at her sister as if to say 'what are you talking about' and then looked at me with the most surprised look I had ever seen on my mother's face.  She later told me I was the last person she was expecting to see walking into that North Dakota farm house.

It ended up being the last time all my mother's siblings were ever able to get together.  Eventually they all passed and in 1998 the farm was sold.  But I am forever grateful to Garrison Keillor and his fateful story that moved me to tears and lead me back to that final family gathering at a farmhouse in North Dakota."
"I really miss Prairie Home Companion, I listened to it every week for over 20 years.  I loved it!"
"I'm grateful for his writing and work, and I'm glad to see he is well."
"My husband and I would go on long rides in the country just to listen to the show on the car radio. Show ended, we'd find a place to eat then head home. Such good memories and PHC was a part of it. Thank you, Garrison. It's a shame about this scandal."
A PHC was/is show always better seen on the radio. I would listen with my kids in the car. They grew up “having” to listen to him. Years later when my oldest daughter left home and was thousands of miles away she listened to him (PHC) and becoming homesick wrote him a letter thanking him for giving her great memories of her childhood with her dad! He wrote he a wonderful letter which i have framed with a picture of her and me. Whatever he might of done to this one person he certainly did a wonderful thing for my daughter and me. 😊
"I miss the days or tuning into NPR and enjoying PHC, Car Talk, and Whad,ya Know"
I think it is true that the culture changed. We need to find a way to forgive people who have made lessor mistakes and admit them. It is the only way we can allow people to change. Look at how much he gave us. I wish I could have been in Denver to see him. Once I wrote a letter to him and he wrote back a personal response on a postcard that specifically related to my letter.  Bless your soul Garrison Keillor.
The man is a national treasure who unfortunately is a human being
"Many years ago Keillor worked with his romantic partner Margaret Moos who was a producer on the show and referred to as part of the show at every episode. He went to a high school reunion and ran into an old romantic interest, dumped Moos and talked on air a lot about being newly in love. For those of us who had heard him work with Moos for years, it was weird to hear him insensitively go on about the new relationship on air. Not only had Moos lost him as a partner but presumably her job and a name we heard for years simply disappeared. He upended her life and didn’t see how this might come across as he waxed lyrical about his new love. We could never hear him the same way again. He apparently divorced the then new wife and has remarried. He is a brilliant storyteller but in terms of his own actions apparently has significant blind spots…..and doesn’t even allow that is possible. It’s sad for all involved."
I drove every Saturday 2-4 pm to listen to him on NPR. Awesome story teller.
"I am glad for this update. I began listening to PHC in the early 1980s and became a longtime fan. Keillor had a very long, distinguished career and his downfall was swift and shocking."
I've listened to Garrison since 1984 and have seen many of his live performances.  He is an icon and has brought joy to so many people.  We all make mistakes and bad decisions in our lives.  All we can do is learn from them and move forward.
Your voice your laugh your stories are truly missed every Saturday evening since 2016.....You are blessed!
"I think he hit the nail on the head when he described a shifting social climate in which so many of the ""accepted"" practices of the past--some of which may have been perfectly innocent--put men who were in positions of power or authority at risk for perceived threats, overtures, or indecencies on the part of the receiver. Painful lesson learned. I, for one, have been listening to Garrison since the late 1970s and I love the man. If numerous evengelical preachers can request ""confession, redemption, and forgiveness"" for past mistakes or crimes, why can't Keillor?"
The culture did change. Being employed in corporate America as a mid level manager I can attest to that cultural change. It is up to the person being harassed what is inappropriate. It is not up to the person being accused. For years what was considered flirtation between coworkers has now became a potentential issue for HR intervention. Garrison is correct in today's climate you cannot risk being friends with a coworker of the opposite sex.
"His is a voice I miss, his are stories that carried us all away to the places many of us hoped would have existed. Garrison's imagination, humor, candor, & unabashed honesty, refreshing familiarity and welcoming nature invited everyone to feel they had a life-long friend who would always welcome visitors each and every week. May God continually bless him with renewing creativity. Like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon and Prairie Home Companion took us to a place far, far, away, in a memorably amusing and entertaining way. I was charmed. 
Upon reflection, I believed he did harm to the trust in his actual, virtual, and imagined relationships. Knowing what he admitted about himself,  I question the authenticity of the idealization of his characters. Maybe a public apology would be better than simply a public admission. 
Yes indeed, the culture changed. Yet, there remains an absolute good regardless of cultural norms. Through the process of admitting norms were in need of correction, we all grow and mature in our relationships. 
Women are to be treated as equals, even if our roles are separated by cultural expectations. Yet, even this has changed. However, women deserve more respect rather than less as they retain the role of childbearing, something that elevates them rather than reduces them to merely objects of desire or affection. For one must consider the whole person even to their soul and spirit which is greater in importance than the body and the mind or anything dependent on physical elements such as feelings.
We must respect the potential as well as the realized person who is beloved of God. Lusting in one's thoughts, also harms the individual's relationships. To be able to, jointly, be the bearers of newly formed persons, parents, indeed all persons bear the responsibility to care for and carry future generations with the utmost care. Beyond that, to bear one another's burdens, it is blessed, especially when assisting a woman who bears or cares for the most vulnerable among us.
Fantasy, especially sexual, ignores most aspects of another person besides creating a grandiose image of one's self. This shame is on all of us for no one is separated from the love of God and we are one who place our trust in Christ Jesus. Any time someone watches an inappropriate film with enjoyment, anytime explicit photos are exposed, any time music with suggestive content is tolerated, one tolerates and perpetuates this culture of dehumanization."
I really missed him.
"In 2009, David Letterman spoke on his show about having sexual relationships with several of his female staffers over the years.  He apologized and that was about it."
"I am a 30 year fan of Prairie Home Companion.  I'm 64 years old and I bought many, many books on tape to listen to in my car over the years.  Garrison Keillor feels like family to me.  Lake Wobegon is as familiar to me as my own home town.  This country has lost it's direction when it allows people to be punished without EVIDENCE of wrong doing.  God bless you, Mr. Keillor and his family.  I miss you every Sunday!!"
"Oh my gosh!
I didn't realize how much I miss him and his soothing stories while driving for my job!  😊😍
*sigh*
He will always be my sweet Prairie Home Companion.  
Love and best wishes to you always for the countless hours of radio companionship, Garrison. 😘❤🤗"
"Love you, Garrison. You've been such a gem for so many years in my life. May you have precious years going forward!"
"I miss PHC a lot; my wife and I listen to it every Sunday, and we're not some old couple but in our late 30s. The fact the show was canceled and not allowed to grow with the times means a whole generation will miss out on its wholesomeness."
"How Garrison's story is reported and talked about is a good reminder to me about how incomplete the news we receive is. Having worked at the organization, (although not for APHC but in the same location) I can tell you that this situation is *a lot* thornier and complex than either Team Keillor or Team MeToo thinks it is.  If you're tempted to make some pat judgement on either side, do so with the understanding that you don't have all the information."
i miss  him  on the radio  every  staurday   at  5pm
"I love Prairie Home Companion, I sure to miss listening to this weekly.  I looked forward to it every week."
"I’m in the uncomfortable in-between of having grown up with PHC; loving the show and Keilor’s work over the decades. But I can’t just dismiss the accusations because they are against someone influential to me. I think he’s telling people the wrong lesson from all of this too. Men and women can be friends at work, but maybe don’t send emails or have conversations discussing intimate encounters, theoretical or not."
"My husband and I were huge GK fans as well PHC. I was heartbroken when all this came out several years ago, however due to certain comments in his monologues about women it gave the charges a ring of truth.

When I initially saw this interview I was tickled to see him back; then I watched him speak. “You should not be friends with a female colleague - it’s dangerous.” (4:17) This puts women in the position to be blamed, very reminiscent of many high schools dress codes (girls need to cover up as not to tempt the boys). I’ve never heard him apologize for his actions or to the woman. Yet he’s the victim."
I so miss his wonderful show and also the poems he used to read on NPR stations!
I loved Garrison 40 years ago and I love him today.  His voice soothes me.
I still listen to his Writer's Almanac on podcasts apps & on his website. A true legend.
"When reading his words,
I would at times laugh out loud and need to pause to savor the humor. Thank you 😊"
"I discovered PHC only a few short years ago.  Loved the show.  I tell people that I work with, we are co-workers NOT friends.  I can be friendly at work, but (usually) have no desire to hang out after work with them.  I keep it separate."
He reached WAY more than 4 million people!
"I will always be thankful to Garrison Keillor for giving me a five-minute reprieve from my daily tasks with his thoughtful ""Writer's Almanac."" CBS' ""Sunday Morning"" understands his contributions to popular culture, but also gave him an opportunity to publicly make amends (doable even within the confines of his non-disclosure agreement). At his age he should have been honest. This was a missed opportunity for Keillor."
"PHC was the highlight of my weekends, they have been as light hearted and full of just a simple happiness his stories used to bring since he signed off."
"I started listening to PHC in 1981, and from then on I planned my weekends around it.  As much as I loved the show, when the MeToo thing happened I wasn't actually surprised.  I had been noticing Keillor's creepy interactions with female guests on the air for a couple of years.  Saddens me, but I still admire and respect the work he did for decades."
"Mr. Keillor, thank you for sharing the ""8 mm pearls of wisdom"" over the years in your storytelling.  Those pearls are the gift of learning from someone else's mistake and deciding, ""I'm not doing THAT!""  My personal motto is ""Make Peace.  Move Forward.""  You seem to be moving forward and you seem to have made peace.  GJBrownDO 12/3/2023 13:25 Eastern"
"Garrison Keillor was a man of the 20th Century and the 21st Century saw him outside of the mainstream. I remember how the world was in the 1980s and 90s and even then, it was a world where powerful men at the top openly took liberties with women they worked with, where as long as they were charming and likeable as a whole to most people they came in contact with that they could intimidate staff, make inappropriate jokes, creepily ""flirt"" with underlings, cross lines and boundaries pretty much with impunity. Keillor wasn't the worst offender but he was still an offender and ultimately he didn't lose much other than a chunk of his audience and reputation. Hopefully these women have moved on with some peace and solace themselves."
"God bless this man and his work. He's my hero, regardless."
A great storyteller that I've enjoyed through the years ...Glad he's back for an encore!
"I grew up listening to Prairie Home Companion. A fixture of my Saturday nights. There is no comparison, or replacement. The show painted images in my head, that cannot be undone. It’s unfortunate what happened, and only the two involved will ever know the truth. A settlement was reached, and life moves on."
"When a researcher, who by the very nature of that job, is a savvy person and when she speaks of a power imbalance with a man like GK, how naive can she/we be?  With those emails which mentioned ""sweet"" in regard to his suggestions, it makes one wonder  if GK had been given some encouragement before he ever responded?  Unfortunately, such accusations from a person who claims it was inappropriate are, in themselves, inappropriate for the real and serious accusations in the beginning of Me Too!!  The station should have never jumped on that wagon for anything so thin."
PHC and Writer's Almanac are two parts of the entertainment world this country needs right now.  Loved miss them both very much.
"I have three wonderful memories from that era on NPR: 1) the annual PHC joke show, especially when Paula Poundstone was part of the gang;  2) Liane Hansen's mellifluous voice (always like a ray of sunshine), in particular her interview with Andre Previn;  3) Marian MacPartland's ""Radio Jazz"" program. // Today's NPR is, at best, a mixed bag."
"She said it wasn't mutual. Even the brief email they showed on this video proves she was lying. Why did anyone take her word for it? Why did he settle? Just because people say ""believe the woman"" and he's a man?"
"I still love him. The times changed
As a woman in my 70s  when I was in my 30s and 40s  many men I worked with would hug us tease us etc ..much of the time while I was married as were the guys.  I  I was never offended as it was all in good humor and true affection. If you didn't  like it a no was respected. If someone asked you something inappropriate I'd just say nothing to the question and give a sarcastic smile. And that always was respected. I think people are oversensitive these days. I met my husband under professional circumstances and liked him and he waited until he was not over me to ask me out. And I said yes. Many I know met their spouse ( still married forever) at work and it's ridiculous to think people can't be friends or date coworkers."
he blew it and isn’t taking responsibility for his inappropriate actions
"It is so hard when we come to love and respect and learn a lot from someone's artistry and then have to understand that they are not the people we might hope them to be. Then we must see their art as separate from their lives, broken as we all are and maybe more so."
I was missing and lamenting the demise of Prairie Home Companion just this morning on my commute. Finding this tonight was a pleasant surprise.
"I learned English hearing and reading Tales from Lake Wobegon.  I imagined being there and living its stories.  Keillor is an amazing story teller.  His stories are amazing full of life and spirit.  It is sad to see him in this situation, his reputation tarnished.  But I will always have a place in my heart for Prarie home companion and Lake Wobegon."
"The governing body at NPR do not want to foster understanding, humanity, Americana, pride of community unless it’s their interpretation of those ideals. A Prairie Home Companion offered those individuals who were able to see across political lines an opportunity to enjoy a sense of community, fostering honest dialogue not simply labeling themselves as morally superior standing in the right on all issues, according to their Donating Demographic. It was a lovely show. You can stream them at their website for free. Not under written by MERCEDES….National Peddled Radio"
"I was once rushing across a busy NYC intersection more concerned with the light changing than looking ahead of me when this gentleman was doing the same thing but going in the other direction. We collided. Hard. It felt like hitting a brick wall wearing clothes. I wouldn’t be surprised if he found my makeup-smudged image on his shirt front when he got home. Luckily clear of traffic, we quickly steadied, studied, and “so sorried” each other. I knew instantly who he was. He noticed my astonishment. I didn’t ask why he wasn’t in Lake Wobegon. He didn’t offer an explanation, just a confirming trademark grin and a friendly squeeze of my arm before he stepped aside and disappeared into the oncoming throng still in the crosswalk behind me.  I can’t help but wonder looking back if nowadays a woman experiencing such a startling encounter might not be too sensitized to be able to appreciate someone’s affectionate civility as intended.  It certainly never occurred to me at the time to mistake kindness for trespass."
"I believe and stand with survivors. I used to listen to his show. I don't miss it. It is a slap in the face to survivors to deify him, and act like his actions were meaningless or somehow ok."
Without forgiveness there is only pain and despair. Forgiveness does not mean forgetting or learning from the past.
"I briefly interned at MPR in the late 1980s and was warned to steer clear of ""Scary Gary."" So, I did."
Loved A Prarie Home Companion.  He's a talented writer.   He's also in the wrong and that fact he doesn't see it is concerning.
"Wholesome, quality entertainment. I listened every week."
"It's too bad they spent so much time on the misconduct issue, and not his immense gift to the American literary landscape. It can't be measured."
"Keillor is 100% guilty of unwanted sexual contact. I know, because he did it to me.  He was a huge influence in my life, so imagine my disappointment in those here who say his punishment doesn't fit the crime. Oh, yes it does. And it still should. Mason did a great job detailing it. I did speak to Minnesota Public Radio about it. I just can't stop crying this morning watching this man talk about his friendship with a colleague was a mistake. I have a son named after Keillor. And what he did to me was no mistake. It was deliberate. Make no mistake that Keillor has used his writing abilities to tell himself that something is not a big deal, and it is."
"I woke up most mornings for many years to the Prairie Home Morning Show on MPR with Garrison and the late Tom Keith, his engineer, as sidekick Jim Ed Poole. They played a wildly eclectic selection of music (where else could you hear Swann and Flanders, Kate Wolf, Mozart, Buddy Holly, and Tom Lehrer, to name just a few, on the same show on the same day?) with sponsors including Jack’s Auto Repair (all tracks lead to Jack’s), Bertha’s Kitty Boutique, Powdermilk Biscuits, and the Catchup Advisory Board. It made mornings a lot easier to swallow."
"""You should never be friends with a female colleague, EVER!""
It has been noticed since MeToo that older men are reluctant to mentor younger women strictly as a preemptive self-defense.
-the Law of Unintended Consequences is one of those you just can't ever break."
Excellent. I was an early and long time listener to Garrison. His storytelling prose is only comparable the a very few greats.
"I Worked in a 5 star hotel for 11years meeting many celebrities and international business people,  Garrison Keeller was a guest in the hotel. He was the rudest, most arrogant person I ever encountered in all the years I worked in the hospitality business"
I do miss his show on the BBC.. it would have been a real comfort during the last 2 or 3 horrid years...
How hard is it to admit that you did some creepy things and you're sorry?
"He did the show for a long, long time, but I could never stomach listening to the entire broadcast."
"I loved Garrison Keillorr's radio show LW , his delivery was outstanding and so intoxicating . Amazing show :D"
"Welp, I started the video hoping to be able to listen to him again, it was going well, then the interview happened."
I love him.  What happened to Mr. Keillor was an injustice.  I am overjoyed to have him back.
It sets women in the work force to say You can never be friends with women at work.  You should not write email about imagining  sexual settings.  He has learned nothing.
"Dear Mr. Keillor,
Thank you for your 40 years, and I only wish you had never stopped.
'Keep on keeping on' as we used to say back in the 60's when I first heard your wonderful stories and enjoyed all of the great music you promoted to the world.
Don't let the crocodiles get you down as, sooner or later, we all have crocodiles in our lives.
Thanks again,

"I grew up listening to him and reading his books. He may have made some mistakes along the way, but who hasn't? Some of my funnest memories as a child involved listening to Garrison Keillor with my family."
I used to be a faithful Prairie Home Companion fan until I saw Keiller on TV very openly groping the poor woman singing with him.
"I love and miss Garrison. Just a good, decent, intelligent, funny human being."
"""Where have all the good men gone?"" They're terrified and turned off. They never would have done anything wrong, but they know that won't protect them. And fear is a turn off."
"His dismissal of the accusations was disappointing to say the least. I truly believe that many men in his generation genuinely do not understand that 1950's flirting is no longer allowed in a workplace. Even if it was ""mutual"",  there is typically an unfair difference in power between the two parties."
He used to be at Ravinia Festival outside of Chicago for years. Always entertaining with a nostalgia for a Lost America that he 😊gifted his audience with on Summer Nights.
"Longtime fan of Garrison's and PHC...
I think someone in this video made an important point regarding ""the punishment fitting the crime."" Sure he made mistakes, but for someone to try and vilify or ""cancel"" him for the rest of his life imo is cold hearted. Love ya G.K. 😻"
Missed this show
"I know Garrison is bitter and  I don't know complete story to make a judgement.  But you can have good and decent relationships with your colleagues or employees.
I separate my work life from my social life. No non-work related banters in the office. Definitely no touching or anything close to it.
Years later, I am on friendly terms with former co-workers, more so than when we were working together."
“Me too was good until I became a part of it and now it’s bad >:(“
He played himself and wrote the screenplay for the film version of A Prairie Home Companion which came out in 2006 that Robert Altman directed and was Altman's last film.
"During my childhood and adolescence I used to listen to Prairie Home Companion on the radio in the kitchen on Saturday evenings.  Years later I sent Prairie Home Companion a bilingual song, 'La rana/The Frog,' I wrote for my students while I was teaching at a primary school in Guatemala.  And Richard Dworsky actually played my song most beautifully during their show.  It was such an enormous honor!  I have only positive feelings regarding Garrison Keillor and Prairie Home Companion!"
"My husband introduced me to Garrison Keillor and Prairie Home Companion. When I heard my first few shows, I was convinced the whole thing was a farce put on by students at UC Berkeley. It was only after attending a live performance in San Francisco that I became a devoted fan of the man in red shoes with his imaginative stories and outstanding guests. I was so disappointed at hearing of his offensive behaviors...a work place line had been crossed...and this interview doesn't explain it all away with ""different culture"" comments."
Always enjoyed his show and writing!
"This man has NOTHING to apologize for.  If anyone knew the real Garrison Keillor...  and a lot of people do... they would understand how outrageously false this claim of 'misconduct' was by a person seeking attention at all cost.  It's simply absurd.
The man is a genius.. and speaks openly about his 'being 'on the spectrum'.  It's very difficult for him to make eye contact.. let alone and pester someone with any level of unwanted advances.  It's just not who he is.  Shame on Minnesota Public Radio.  And shame on the attention seeker who sought to ruin and sacrifice an entire life of good works on the altar of her narcissism."
"I was sorry to see him get caught up in the me too movement. Although I’ve been a victim of sexual harassment at my first “real” job in the early 1970’s, I think he’s right in that times change. However, I totally disagree with him when he says there would be no one in management without sexual harassment; that seems to me like he’s rationalizing his behavior, making excuses. How hard is it to apologize and admit you messed up?"
"A BIG problem with the Me Too  movement is that just by someone being accused , they are ""guilty until proven innocent""  and punished without even getting a fair trial. For those that think it can't happen to yourself, you are being very naive.  When money is involved there will always be certain women that will tell lies to get that money."
"I don't blame him for leaving Minnesota, twice."
"Thank you beloved Garrison. You're all about nuance, but the new world isn't. Thank you CBS."
"He was one of many men like Johnny Depp, Chris Matthews and Morgan Freeman who were unfairly cancelled due to a witch hunt without due process"
This man should be receiving the Kennedy Honors for all he contributed to public radio and roots americana
He’s so incredible.❤
"I live in Keillor’s neighborhood in Minnesota. I would run into him at the post office, grocery store…he is aggressive to get your attention when he likes a pretty girl. He also sued his neighbor for building a garage, because he didn’t like it. He needs to be accountable for his behavior, I believe the victim."
"“You lose your ambition, but you still love your work.” Hmm….seems I’m about 40 years ahead of schedule on that milestone."
The emails are kind of damning 😬
Every accusation should not be believed but they should be taken seriously then investigated.
"Reminds me of that other nice guy, Charlie Rose."
Thank you for all that you've done.
"If abusers weren't filthy rich, none of these women would sue them because you won't profit too much from them. And they wouldn't be able to kill the reputation of an abuser that has none.  Many nasty pigs in the business use their power to lure women into thinking they're on the way to the red carpet, just to sleep with them. Fool me once, the fault's on him for being a sexual predator. Fool me twice, fault's on me because I was too eager for fame and money to listen to my instincts."
"Oh FFS!  It's not just about who is marketable or looks better.  It's about who did the most heinous crime.  Harvey Weinstein would definitely fall into that group.  Don't be so quick to judge those who maybe made some inappropriate or unadvisable decisions with willing adult partners.  Sure, sexual abuse is deplorable & those who commit such behaviour should be held accountable but don't be so quick to write everyone off who you think is guilty but perhaps don't know all the details.  It's very easy to judge but more often than not, the judgement is hypocritical at best."
Kouisine ! Et vite !
The verdict shows that 'no-one' should be able to lie and ruin anyone's life.
"If Jodi wants to safeguard the MeToo movement it HAS to represent ALL victims because neither victim nor abuser has a gender. As women we have to admit that our own gender is capable of being abusive, even physically. Claims HAVE to be accompanied by truth."
"This is crazy.
Imagine someone accused you of abuse, someone who you have never even met, and you're guilty just because you're a man, and the accuser is a woman.
It's insane."
"How hard is it to just understand that both men and women can be victims of abuse, why is justice for one not seen as justice for all 🤦🏽‍♀️"
It’s strange it’s 2022 and no one believes men too can be abused what a SHAME!!!
"I love how she tried to make Amber heard a victim of this “online hate machine” without addressing the fact, she lied numerous times. She contradicted herself numerous times. She admitted to being the abuser on audio. You keep hearing her talk about misogyny but it sounds like there’s a serious bias case of misandry. It’s disgusting how they try to spin this."
"This lady's speech is very scary for everyone experiencing DV. Heard lied , period."
"""For whatever reason, Amber Heard was not believed. How will that affect the MeToo movement?"" You cannot consider the question without going back to what you deliberately ignore---the reason she was not believed. She obviously lied, over and over and over. Those of us who watched the trial decided based on  what we saw. Engage with the facts, first, then ask your questions."
"We aren’t Johnny Depp “fans”. We watched the trial, saw the evidence and clearly saw she was lying 😂 Simple as that."
"What Amber Heard did was a setback to REAL domestic violence victims. She sacrificed the progress of the MeToo movement for financial gain. Amber Heard was not attacked, she was not demonized. The public just saw what kind of vile person she is - someone who is willing to say and do anything for her own personal interest/gain and to ruin someone else’s life. SHE DESERVES THIS LOSS. Johnny Depp got the justice he more than deserves."
"An overwhelming amount of people believed Amber when she announced that she was donating the 7 million dollars. After watching her on camera, as someone who worked directly with survivors of DV, she did not convinced me that she was the victim in this case"
"So a man defending himself when a woman threatens his reputation with lies is being inconsiderate?  That's ridiculous, this has nothing to do with the me too movement."
"""Tell the world, Johnny, tell them,'Johnny Depp, I, a man, I'm a victim of domestic violence'. And see how many people believe or side with you."""
Undeniably there is definitely a lack of empathy for abused men. This has to change.
"I'm happy to see a lot of actual DV victims speaking out and contradicting this asinine take. Jodi is a perfect demonstration of just how far people will go to perform the dizzying levels of mental gymnastics needed to overlook very clear and very obvious evidence that opposes their views. Notice how she minimizes JD's abuse at the hands of Amber by saying that it was ""messy on both sides"". Meanwhile, she is a lot less conciliatory when speaking about Amanda's abuse claims. In fact, for her to think that this is a setback for the MT indicates that she believes Amber. She isn't interested in the truth - she just wants validations for her beliefs."
"3 things to recognize in this case:
1. People saying this is too public and had became a circus to humiliate Heard - WHEN - it was Heard that wrote a defamatory op-ed about Johnny and tweeted that she did in fact wrote it AFTER Johnny had already paid her in the divorce and settled this privately. It was Heard that wants this to become a public circus in hope to humiliate Depp. The real victim wanted to move on peacefully and quietly but the abuser wanted the victim to be entirely ruined, therefore, the victim fought back. 
2. People think that defamation lawsuits keeps victims from speaking out in fear of legal action is an infringement to free speech, but free speech does not mean you can take advantage of it to reputably ruin someone with lies and go unpunished. Real victims will always have evidence as strong as Depp does, where as lies are not evidence and can never win the court of law. 
3. People thinks it is a an odd and unreasonable thing that Heard was not believe when it is just as odd and unreasonable that they do not believe Depp just because they are relying on prejudices and stereotypes against a gender."
"I am a woman, and I STAND WITH JOHNNY."
It’s hilarious how hard these folks are trying to defend an abuser and liar
"This case showed that men can be abused too and should come forward about it instead of staying silent. AH relied on Johnny being too ashamed to come forward, but he did and the public believed him. AH was proven to be a liar on the witness stand several times based on evidence and her own testimony and that of her friends. The jury couldn't believe anything she said."
"This case was particularly different because looking at the evidence, SHE was the abuser."
"If your castle will tumble down because justice was served or the truth was told, you don’t have a castle, you have a house of cards."
"When she claimed she was assaulted with a liquor bottle and then had no medical or law enforcement evidence to back it up, not to mention flew to the states the next day, she totally lost me.  She's a liar, a manipulator, and she's abusive. I'm glad she lost."
"Wow, what a bitter woman.
The ONLY “implication” is that if you lie about abuse you deserve the consequences."
All experts aren't experts. She's definitely not one
This woman is clueless. Amber can not tell the truth. Ever. It’s that simple  She set it back
"The setback for women isn't Johnny winning the case, it's Amber lying about domestic violence. What Amber did for real DV is catastrophic, shame on you, Amber."
"It offends me when people  suggest I didn't find Amber credible only  because I was jumping on some social media bandwagon. I'm an IPV survivor who watched every minute of this  trial and reached my own verdict in favor of JD.  Unsubstantiated bias against this male victim if DV is what would harm the  credibility of the ""Me too"" movement."
"The only ones who should be worried about this case and its outcome are liars, whether they be male or female. I can't imagine a true victim of DV, such as myself, and SA as looking to AH as an example. I don't condone any of the violence towards her, but maybe she and other potential false accusers will be more cautious before attacking their victims going forward. We can only hope."
"How people could still be on her side is insane. The evidence literally shows her to be a guilty, evil and a horrible person. Well, as we see from this case, they're are a lot of people like Heard, and they're the ones supporting her."
This only hurts the women who are lying
My cousin was sent to prison because his ex girlfriend and mother of his daughter accused him of rape all the while she was cheating on him. Her sister even backed up her story which made him look guilty. It wasn't until a few years later that new evidence and actual witnesses came forward and he was released and found inocente of all charges. He now lives peacefully with his daughter trying to be the best father for her. As for his ex and her sister I really don't know what happened to them. I think he refused to press charges as long as he had full custody of his daughter and never get to see her ever again. Johnny Depp was right that we need to go back to Inocente Until  Proven Guilty.
"The thing that’s hurting the me too movement is the doubling down and defending the lying abuser because it’s a woman. The public was on her side until the facts were brought to light in court. Supporting JD is supporting victims. 

Also, cameras should be in courts for the same reason cameras should be on cops."
I lost any potential future respect for Jodi Kantor here
"I wish she commented on how prejudicial it is to real victims when someone lies about being a victim/survivor. If there's anything from this case that truly harms true survivors, it's not the defamation case, it's the mess Amber created that will deter anyone from coming forward out of fear of not being believed. Or even abusive partners referencing this case whenever their victims consider exposing them. Amber Heard is a disgrace."
"This is INSANE.
The law is the law, public opinion and social media played absolutely no part in the findings of the jury and the way people keep trying to spin this in that direction is disgusting. This woman seems to imagine that every man should face the trial of public opinion, that the mere accusation of abuse should be enough to destroy someone and no jury, no evidence, no legal process is necessary.
And you'll all notice that this woman doesn't give a damn about the torrent of abuse and humiliation Depp faced when Heard made her false allegations, and that wasn't from just a few Twitter accounts, that was the ENTIRE MEDIA.
I'm a bleeding heart liberal but I want no part of a ""social justice"" movement which attacks the rule of law and claims that all men are abusers and all women are incapable of lying, even after a trial in which the woman ADMITTED to abuse, failed to produce any evidence that she was a victim and even presented blatantly falsified photos in an attempt to lie.
This MeToo movement has destroyed itself, assisted by Heard and women like Kantor who seem obsessed with a narrative that all men are evil and all women meek and innocent beings incapable of lying.
Believe all victims, but require a legal process."
"If the MeToo is a movement that requires innocent men getting accused of heinous crimes, then I'm glad it's getting a setback because a movement that requires innocent people's lives getting destroyed by abusers deserves to be in the garbage."
"Oh please they didn’t need a campaign, the way she behaved and how there was no tears showed people her true colors 🤷‍♀️
It’ll help MEN who have also been abused to come forward. Why aren’t we considering what this means for them? Metoo is never going to disappear but we also need to support men who are abused."
"I thought the word ""misogyny"" would start to be tossed around in the absence of any real evidence.  In my experience, a lot of the anti-Heard commenters were female survivors of abuse who recognised their own abuser in Amber Heard and saw themselves reflected in the experience of Johnny Depp.  There was also a ton of male survivors of female abuse who were saying, ""Yes, Amber Heard is exactly like my abuser.""  This was not a tirade of misogynistic toxic masculinity, so quit this nonsense while you still have some credibility."
Supporting a liar weakens your cause
"This case showed that not every ""me too"" woman says true..."
"If the MeToo movement does go away. Then it will be on Amber. She chose to lie about the horrific abuse, especially when it's revealed she was the abuser. She personally made it hard for 'actual' victims to come forward. Justice was served in this trial."
"Why the media does not say ""this is a step forward to protect men from false accusations""?"
"The verdict isn’t a “setback” it’s a step forward it is a signal that no matter your gender or sex you cannot falsely accuse someone of something they didn’t do, you cannot use your status to weaponize hatred against the opposite sex, amber heard is a liar and an abuser. This trial showcased that men can be and are victims of abuse at the hands of women and to ignore that is disgraceful"
"The lesson anyone should take here is 1) don’t abuse your partner, 2) don’t lie and make up bs about others, definitely not under oath on court and 3) men can be victims in DV too"
She was attacked on line because we were able to watch ourselves and see who the abuser was
This is not a setback to women at all! Its justice for both Men and Women. Abuse has no gender!! I was mentality abused and I stand with Johnny!
Are you guys serious. She lied! She tried to ruin the man’s life! The evidence is OVERWHELMINGLY in JD favor. She couldn’t take 1 picture out of all the pictures and videos she took of her face beaten and bloodied? Because it didn’t happen. This sets back women because now they have to have picture proof of their wounds or they won’t be believed….. BECAUSE OF HER.
"She was ""not believed"", Cuz she was caught lying and FALSELY accusing an innocent victim of her machinations, in front of the whole F world!"
"I don't know why it is difficult to believe that men can be recepient of Abuse and they can be a victim too.....Why the mainstream focus is on women who might not come out but rather it sets an example  that women who are abusers and liars cannot hide behind and claim themselves to be a victim of Abuse.....Also more men needs to come forward like Johnny Depp did.
As for Me too movement...... everything had its course and seems like this movement has run its course."
I did not know how generous Johnny Depp was I learned wonderful things about him in this trial from her side as well
"Everyone is missing the point. The public will not support people who take advantage of using ""Me Too"" allegations! She was caught lying numerous times and used the ""Me Too"" standings to earn browny points. This is why the public is outraged and side with JD."
"Bless these poor reporters. First Elaine, and now this lady. These reporters are trying so hard to be polite and politically correct. They all know that Amber is a pathological liar, but they have to suppress their true feelings. I wouldn’t work in this environment for a million dollars."
"Me too should stand for all the abused, women or men! Why not say that this verdict encourages men to come forward to tell their stories? The gender bias is so flagrant!"
Why is this woman (in blue) looking at domestic violence as a man doing it to women problem. If she was a real feminist or for equal rights she would be against domestic violence period in spite of who the perpetrator is. This is why we have a judicial system and people have the right to defend themselves.
"Please stop victimizing all this. 
No one is cheering for the home team, people were cheering for the truth and justice.  Amber had NO credibility."
Amber heard is a disgrace for all those poor woman who truly suffered from abuse.
"Im a survivor of physical abuse, and I watched this trial from beginning to end never missed a minute of it and the story you should be talking about is that violence and domestic abuse is simply the same no matter what gender. Heards team didn’t have the mounting evidence that Mr.Deeps team had, I became engrossed in this trial because I couldn’t believe that someone would lie about such a serious thing such as abuse. But as the trial went on it was clear that she lied. My partner is a man who Ive seen first hand suffer abuse from his ex girlfriend who has now turned around on social media accusing him of the emotional and physical violence she inflicted on him. 

Im a women and a survivor and barely made it out alive from my past relationship, which is why Im sickened and think it is a gross injustice to lie about a story that so many people -both men and women have endured. But yet you don’t report what truth Mr. Deeps team has brought to light, that is women abuse too and lying about it is wrong and is ethically immoral to those TRUE VICTIMS of domestic and sexual violence. Your reporting is completely biased. I was on Ms. Herds side at the beginning but over the course of the trial it was clear she was the violent and emotional ABUSER. It was a toxic relationship but she lied. I don’t understand why the conversation that ABUSE IS ABUSE NO MATTER GENDER. I am woman and don’t think this is a set back for #metoo this is different she took advantage of a movement and was held accountable for it. Let her and him move on and heal and let’s recreate the narrative that abuse to people is abuse period."
"While the “me too” movement had some positive effects - the “believe all women” (regardless of evidence) aspect wasn’t very good. 

I was told that feminism was for everyone, but I am now seeing how toxic branches of it have harmed both men and women.

For men that have been mentally/physically abused, this was a huge win."
Wow Jodi Kantor is in denial! The look on everyone’s faces (1:53) when she said it was unclear who won…priceless! Did she even watch the Trial??? She should’ve consulted with her PR before speaking here.
"If the Me Too movement doesn't want to be brought down, then they should get disown Amber Heard."
"Amber is an Abuser but no one is saying this ,they are just blaming Johnny Depp's star power? Amber presented herself as an innocent woman which shes not I cant wait for Johnny's team to give Interviews and debunk all this lies."
She doesn't represent woman she lie a lot.she was the abuser this lady doesn't know how is to deal with a narcissistic person.
its Me Too without Heard it only hurts liars who abuse the system.
What Amber did was make a mockery of those of us who are REAL victims of abuse! It is vile and disgusting that they still are trying to defend her! Have they forgotten the past six years of hate Johnny has received? Amber and her team can shove it!
"The broader implications are that men and women should speak out even when their partner claims, ""No one will believe you!""
     JD the VICTIM, Won the case. AH the ABUSER lost. Justice was served even though the man was the abused. More abuse victims should be heartened."
The “verdict” didn’t hurt the me too movement. A woman lying about being assaulted did though.
"When I listen to this interview I see her ducking and dodging the question that they're asking. This verdict did not set back the me-too movement. This verdict let victims know you will be believed and your abusers will be held accountable so don't give up fight as hard as you can.
What all of these people on these clown panelists don't understand is victims come in all shapes, sizes  genders, sexual orientation Etc. And the me-too movement doesn't necessarily just be about woman it's about victims coming out telling their story and seeking justice. Women are not the only ones who go through this men do as well but it's harder for them to step out in the spotlight and tell their story"
"The ''MeToo'' movement lost the plot when it morphed into ''believe all women.'' Despite the fact that women are far more likely to be DV victims than men, choosing to believe one group based on gender is nonsensical. Heard lost the case because she wasn't credible; she lied and equivated throughout the trial, even when it wasn't necessary."
I don’t think she is able to answer a straight question.
And the reason she got so much hate and we cheered for depp is because of the EVIDENCE!
"“For whatever reason, was not believed.” 
What? Probably because of all the evidence against her…."
Jodi Kantor is gaslighting here.
"This woman's comments just made the me too movement a joke in my eyes, especially since I am a passionate advocate for women's rights. Her and Amber are who and what's taking away the movements credibility because no matter what justice and fairness must prevail"
"• Under oath Amber lied multiple times and presented falsified evidence. 
• As a formerly abused spouse Amber and her attorney are repulsive to me. 
• Johnny and Heard abused each other, both need to be in detox and counseling."
"The “me too” celebrities are afraid to criticize any woman who makes allegations. The
“believe every women” who steps forward has not aged well."
Not mentioning the fact she admitted several times on tape that she hit him
She was never a victim ! We don’t claim her!!!
2:01 that silence was so loud 🤣🤣
If anyone falsely accuses someone of domestic violence or rape they should face the same legal consequences as a real perpetrator
"""For whatever reason, Amber Heard was not believed. How will that affect the MeToo movement?""
OBJECTION - leading!"
"This verdict served two purposes only:  it exposed a lying abuser who happened to be female, and it allowed men to not feel ashamed of coming forward when they've been abused by women."
"Be honest, some women lie! As some men do. Johnny owned up to his faults. However,  Amber took zero responsibility. We the people heard her on tape. Face it, she is a liar an an abuser. The Amber alert was poetic Justice!"
Nothing screams equality like ideology before truth.
"This insistence by some women in media to blame misogyny for Heard losing is very irritating. Her legal team were appalling, Heard herself came across unlikeable and was proven to be a liar on a number of issues. No sensible person is seeking to hold this against every woman who claims DV in the future but we can't just blindly believe every allegation."
It's crazy how many people aren't willing to accept the fact that men can be victims of domestic abuse as well. They always talk about misogyny but this really just sounds like misandry. Some just wanna see men burn so bad that they'll never give them a fair chance when it comes to these kinds of things
"To the contrary, abused women are happy the abuser is punished. When you have been abused you recognize an abuser anywhere. It is not about being a women or a man.... ( by the way, I thought nobody knows anymore what a woman is)....."
It’s should hurt women that are thinking of coming forward to lie YES AND IT DAMN WELL SHOULD
This needs to be realized as that men can be victims too there is so much biased towards women that it's hard for men to speak up for themselves I my self have lost my family because I felt that I could not speak up when I was taken advantage of because I felt no one would believe me and because of that my marriage ended Im for equality and believe that it shouldn't be onesided
The jury did not see all the on line public comments
I find it interesting that no one on this panel had the balls to be honest and point out that Amber Heard lied multiple times and acknowledge the overwhelming wrongdoing on her end
I love how equality gets out of the window the minute the female is found to be wrong
Why would it hurt other women coming forward? This one involved a newspaper article blaming a man for DV against a woman.  99.99% of cases of DV don’t involve outing abusers in the media so it doesn’t conflate with the overwhelming majority of cases.
The second crime was that Johnny didn't win the 50 million actually he was the one who would have deserve the 100 million dollars
"No abuse victim would ever follow their abuser room to room, begging/pleading for their abuser to continue fighting! Then, call their abuser names in an attempt to provoke the abuser to continue fighting when they want to seperate to cool down. This is why noone believes AH. As a DV survivor, we cannot disregard truth and due process!"
Amber's lies were the setback. She is an anchor around your feet pulling you guys down.
This verdict made me MORE COMFORTABLE in reporting domestic violence!!!!
Wow. Just unbelievable. Obviously they have not watched the whole trial.  Does any media do real fact check?  No wonder Amber was so confident she was going to win. So proud of the jurors who weighed the overwhelming false evidence by Amber to give justice to the  truth to Johnny.
"It should be vice versa,man got victimized too,..."
"Jus like AH, MeToo movement never takes any accountability! Dont try to dodge the bullet, instead accept your wrong and maybe the movement will continue to truly stand for its purpose! If not, it will fall as quick as AH did!"
Amber belittled Johnny didn't she...
Every man has experienced saying something that was innocent and a woman taking offense. Not worth the risk
Women are your direct competitors in the labor market. Respond accordingly.
"Women can't handle the fact the metoo movement was a terrible one.  
We can't talk anymore in the workplace, can't do anything and then wonder why we're feeling more and more lonely, relationships are sucking, we have no friends.
Take a look at what the metoo has done, it wasn't good."
Just keep your distance guys. Stay safe.
Just ignore the women . They keep changing The rules and then if a man is cute or sexy then the rules may not apply
Segregation. Its the only way for guys to work happily.
"Do not offer assistance, do not mentor, concentrate only on your own advancement, never help a direct competitor, never initiate any conversation. Only talk about work matters and only through emails.

Keep every email.

Log each meeting, minute the contents and archive.

Never attend company social gatherings, have no social media contacts with anyone in work.

Your colleagues are not your friends.

Your job is transaction only.

Trust no one.

NEVER GIVE ANYONE A COMPLIMENT, EVEN IF PRESSURED, WALK AWAY."
We should all be on pins and needles around each other.
"Keep things professional and don't talk about anything that doesn't have to do with work because if you get too comfortable and friendly, you'll unknowingly cross a line."
This movement is responsible for the trust deficit that exists at work. No more breakfast after work. Going to sporting events. We're all robots.
"Careful what you say, careful with your body language and they say men are overreacting, doesn’t sound like that to me. Keep safe guys."
Im autistic and rather use all of my energy trying to communicate to a women and stressing that if something goes wrong the consequences will be dire for me so i choose to completely refuse to talk or coexist with them
Don’t dip your pen in company inc is was I learned very early
"Despite what managers might try to push otherwise, work is not a bi-sexual speed dating session ""to improve employee communications"".
Offices are for work.
If you want to talk about what you do after work then talk about it after work."
Just ignore and keep everything professional
This is why men need to think before they speak.
Believe Women
She actually gets paid for this shit.
I'll work the way I want to
😅😂
Everybody has an idea of how men should make women more comfortable in the workplace....when men can simply avoid the problem allll together. Lmaooooooo. The unintended consequences. It is what it is. We dont want to hear yall advice. We just wont work with yall! Period
"Gradually eliminating women from my private life has blessed me with calm, clear thinking, financial security, and wondrous 
amounts of free time.  Looking back at my life before #MeToo, I now realize that ALL of my problems and stress revolved around
women.  I must still deal with them, very cautiously, in the workplace.   My behavior has changed.  My goals have changed.
I am far healthier and happier than I have ever been.   Life is very rewarding and every day feels like a new adventure.   Thank You, #MeToo."
"Just like with Feminism, no one wants to address the toxicity created by some of these movements."
"As a married man i avoid casual contact with women for serveral rational reasons. 1. I dont want to be misconstrued as a creep. 2. I dont want to risk my career, good name, and good credit due to anything that may be misconstrued.  3. Look at tik toks showing guys that are labeled creeps just for working out which is why i will completely avoid women or use a blindfold while working out so i cant be labled creepy and concentrate on me getting healthy. You cannot force me to be uncomfortable so you feel better about yourself."
Amber Heard single handedly destroyed the entire movement. Thank her!
women use MeToo movement as a weapon to attacks man in the workplace.
"The ""Me Too Movement"" lost all credibility by failing to respond to Ashley Biden's cry for help. ❤️🙏"
If society is equal why isn't #MenToo a thing?
Its easier to just avoid women.
The me too BS went way too far and now these are the consequences ladies!!!!! 😅
"Cause and Effect much? The other issue here that of course no one wants to bring up, is that of course the media will only bring up the extremes spectrums of both sides.  The fast majority of Americans are in the middle but of course that is never shown."
Why tf yo keep putting men rights and misogyny together
Generation z don't think you cannot get me too on any given day or night.
i like it how they turn it all around back onto men.
Not even talking about misandry
"Its hard to not think that, even in the smallest of ways, the overturning of Roe was some sort of backlash for the #MeToo movement...as sad as that is to say."
"ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, etc. are nothing but an all girls club and this is all you can expect from them and this is one reason I don't watch them anymore.
I remember the days of Walter Cronkite when there was objective journalism . Those days are gone ."
Never underestimate a me too move.
i love how it awesome to join the feminist movement but not to join a man's rights movement.
so what?
The man is feminist what to say?????????

"The main thing is we must stop the youth from gaining easy access to any content right of center. And maybe any content close to center as well, just to be safe. 

Also if there are young boys out there feeling vulnerable and unheard, it’s important to remind them over and over again that they had it coming."
Another victim. I’m snoozing off now.  Get a backbone and be a champion for women.
report abuse full stop whenever however if you can ax
The feminist movement will die
These are the same clowns who say “Men can get pregnant” 😆👌🤣
Get rid of all these old politicians.  Vote pro choice!

"Very impressed with Jessica Woolford, an articulate defense of a position that _she believes will help both genders to understand consent._ Thanks, you educated me, I wasn't aware that affirmative consent was the gold standard but of course it's obvious now that you point it out. Yes a person can push away and say NO NO No, but even better, _both can agree to events BEFORE engaging in behavior._"
What is the word consent nobody uses it men keep going until women say stop that’s how it works
Why do they care about women now?
"These Hypocrites treat women like children. Your an freakin adult, if you make bad decisions when your drunk thats on you. Deal with it. When guys gets used by woman for their $$ when hes drunk you think anyone cares. Grow up."

"So, when the women's rights movement violates a man's rights, it's still the man's fault."
"Early on, I felt that the ""believe all women, immediately and completely"" thing would cause as much harm as good. It gave female victims the courage to speak up, especially if the abuse is happening at work. Unfortunately, it also gave a megaphone to abusive women who would blackmail men for their own personal gain. This trial won't kill MeToo outright, but I hope it gets people to slow down and think before going on the attack."
Now is the time to address toxic femininity.
Sooo...the movement needs to tie itself to a known liar to maintain its credibility?
"The way ""mainstream"" publications sided with Heard is eerily similar to how ""critics"" pan anti woke comedy specials while the audience loves them."
If Amber did anything she woke up the ignorant of the movement that just because a woman speaks up does not always mean they are being truthful! The mantra in the beginning was to believe ALL women and most of us saw this as an alarm that we would see more women who was NOT honest trying to cash in on the ignorance of the movement!
"""he's on record calling AH terrible things. . ."" calling the person who physically and emotionally abused him names?   At least he didn't throw a vodka bottle at her."
Why does everything have to be so political in this country? This celebrity trial being the end of an admittedly very flawed movement really does highlight how silly and easily influenced the american people are. If Depp vs. Heard was the end of MeToo then MeToo must not have been very strong to start with.
"MeToo, sadly, is not dead. it will not be dead until innocent men can stop living in fear of false allegations potentially destroying their livlihood. #CancelMeToo"
Haven't you ever watched a horror movie? Never turn your back on the monster before you're absolutely sure it's dead.
"What's scary is that it took so much overwhelming evidence for this to fall in his favour, let's just take a moment to consider the situations of many men who don't keep extensive records."
Brett Kavanaugh should sue the actress Christine Blasey Ford for defamation.
"Depp should sue every news outlet for defamation. It would kill me too for good, force the media to finally be accountable at least once, and he just might get those alpacas."
"From what I saw. Amber's evidence about JD all made her look bad. And her past has a history of violence. The videos and audio of Jonny going off was out of context and only recorded at the height of his anger. ( his mom passing, and his old manager stealing millions from him ) and even people who have worked for her never have anything positive to say about her. All of it added up."
Amber Heard ended #MeToo but spawned #MePoo
I never understood the Me too movement. Most of these claim they were assaulted 20 years ago. Hasn’t the statute of limitations already passed for these claims?
*MY DOG STEPPED ON A BEE..* 😩😫
"If anybody tries to tell you that this is setting women back, no this is not. All this means is that some cases need to be taken to court because when women are abused it can easily be proven if she takes the right steps, otherwise women take advantage of this system and it needs to stop"
"My favorite meme of this year is about Johnny Depp being the first man who's ever officially won an argument with a woman!""

Sweet!👌😙"
"Don't forget the 5 million PUNITIVE damages awarded to Depp (changed to 350k by the judge because of the cap in Virginia), but 0 for Amber. That's how awful the Jury thinks Amber is."
"Johnny Depp is my hero! 
He is the first man ever to win an argument with a woman."
I swear to god I will never watch pirates of the Carribbean if Depp isnt in it..
At one point the movement had its merits. Then they ended up with bad actresses that got elevated to representative status. It's these bad actresses throwing false accusations that keep discrediting actual cases.
false accusers need to start doing hard time
Why didn't the Me Too movement stand up for Johnny Depp? The fact they didn't justifies their demise.
"The Depp/Heard verdict does not ""prove Me Too is dead"". Thet ype of person who dog piles on the innocent, using false allegations to destroy them isn't going to give up that ""power""so easily."
*FUNNY HOW MANY WOMEN COME FORTH WHEN SOMEONE IS GETTING NOMINATED INTO OFFICE OR MONEY IS INVOLVED.*
"9:18 Men, for the most part, are afraid to come out about the abuse from their wives so excuse me for not giving a fuck that liars are made less motivated to lie because they MIGHT face consequences (which is rarely the case and if they do face punishment it's a fragment of what men get handed in punishment.)"
Woah... women CAN lie ? Had no idea.
"MeToo , gimme a break just grow up and go to the police if some one does harm to you and not to the Fake MsM !!!"
"No sympathies to liars, whatever gender or no gender it has. Lying is bad and always is."
"As metoo dies so do the rights of protection and provision for women.  Welcome to the club ladies, chivalry is not dead. Now you too are it`s practitioner,  not it's object. The only persons left in our culture who warrant chivalry are children."
"I have an idea, Johnny Depp should demand that Amber Heard confess to the whole world during a press conference and tell the truth about how she treated him. In return Johnny wouldn't demand anymore payments from her. This is only if JD is okay not getting paid but clearing his name even to his detractors."
"as far as I know, when you accuse someone of doing something, specially something criminal you better have evidence. blank accusations supported by nothing but a social movement is utterly wrong."
"will it kill mee too? no. goldfish have longer memories than most people. they will either forget mee too, or forget the amber turd situation. probably the last, reeeee too has to much political utility."
I honestly hope so. But if a man comes out saying he's a victim of DA I will 100% believe him. If a woman comes out I will 100% NOT BELIEVE HER. Don't be mad at me. Get mad at Amber Turd
"As long as there are women & the politicians who pander to them, the #MeAlso movement will never die."
"It may not be the end of #MeToo, but it is unequivocally the inception of #MePoo! 😄"
"I remember seeing MenToo trending for a little bit, and I can understand why. It's not always women who are abused, and guys are likely very hesitant to tell anyone when they are."
"Can we just get the ""innocent until proven guilty"" thingy back?"
"7:57 No, metoo was like an artillery piece. It was just used to destroy but also just so happened get a couple of legitimate targets. Broken clocks, twice a day, and all that."
The ones saying “Metoo is dead” probably are the ones trying to disenfranchise men.
His career took a hit ?   She destroyed his career.
"It's ok to be skeptical when a victim of horrible crimes
doesn't seem to care at all, if the perpetrator goes to prison or not,
as long as there's plenty of zeros on that check."
Heard won't appeal because she can't afford it. They're just blowing smoke.
"IMO the woman who said this was more about an overpriviledged couple airing their dirty laundry in public than anything else is closest to the mark. These are two damaged people who each gave as good as they got imo. But it is nice to see people and the media, however reluctantly, finally acknowledging that men are also the victims of domestic violence committed by women. More often than not in fact. I was in a relationship where when I tried to break up with her the woman physically assaulted me several times, giving me a black eye and broken nose, and tried to run me down with her car in public twice. Every single time I've reluctantly told that story the first question asked, especially by women, is ""Well what did you do to her? It must have been something awful!""."
"""anyone wanna see the end of this trial already? 



me too...""




This guy! XD"
"This just shows that we shouldnt believe all women, as if women are known to be always truthful."
"Yes! Thank you to all anti-feminist out there. This ONE case have solve ALL sexual harassment case. Next time you hear ANY accusation, just remember to this ONE case to judge everything."
"""What's that Shelly?  You're going to sue me for misrepresenting you in my video's?
#WhatstThatShelly"
If only there is a #Mepoo made for Amber instead.
"To kill this off once and for all, Johnny Depp should forgo the damages awarded. He will never collect anyway as she is broke, but it will send many different messages to many people and Depp and all men will have a real win to remind others of."
She was literally sniffing coke in court. She deserves worse than what she got.
More like ‘believe all women’ is dead
Anticipating the demise of me2 was the only reason I took an interest in this trial.
"Women have had rights for long time and if you really look into it, feminism is not about equality it is about dominance"
Wasn't Tara Reade the end of metoo?  This is nothing.
"I personally believe that Depp will manage to get up again and get his life back. Between the two (Depp and Heard), Depp comes out being the more believable victim, while Heard, due to her constant inability to maintain a straight story about her alleged ""victimhood"" looks MUCH less believable to the common people. I don't know if Heard's loss will actually discourage abused women from coming forward to present their case against their abusers, but it will definitely give alleged female ""victims"" (for personal gratification and profit) pause berore they decide to spin Heard style pseudo stories of victimhood WITHOUT definitive, and believable evidence. 
Don't get me wrong; there ARE legitimate female victims of abuse at the hands of both male AND female abusers. Unfortunately for these REAL VICTIMS of abuse, the Depp - Heard trial and the ""Circus"" Me Too movement, has thrown DOUBT into the believability of any such case. IS the woman / female actually a victim of abuse, OR is she looking to convert here story into an easy cash grab and moment in the spotlight? The Me Too movement obviously staked a LOT of their PR on hype - ing this case. 
They should have chosen their ""battleground"" more carefully though since they lost, and lost badly. They can't even complain about the trial's judge since  in this trial, the judge was FEMALE and very scrupulous about disallowing many of the leading questions being peddled by Heard's legal team. THAT team was very obviously trying to play the ""sympathy"" card on Heard's behalf, but they did it clumsily, ineffectively, and at times, stupidly. 
You could say that Heard's team lazily came to the battle with false hopes and verry soggy ammunition. 
If the Me Too movement is dying, it should be allowed to die. It originally had good intentions, but it obviously got blinded by it's ""celebrity status"" and lost it's way. Forget the social media ""hash tagging"". The Me Too movement needs to be replaced with a more honest, and seriously investigative organization that can give the victims of abuse - both female AND male - the forum and voice they need to express their grievances. This new organization should carefully examine each and very case so as to avoid being used by another opportunistic ""Heard"" style ""victim"".
BTW, I notice that many organizations nowadays has the ""face"" of a well fed, widely smiling, female of dark color to promote the idea that it is ""diverse"", and ""for the minorities"" sort of thing. Forget the skin color; that wide smile always makes me think of yor typical ""snake oil"" selling con person every time."
metoo ended when they turned away tara reade with the joe biden case
"I'm fairly certain aliens use earth as a reality TV show, we're absolutely rediculous."
"""Facts and reason finally won out over accusations and libel? #MeToo is over and everyone is sexist! >:("""
"instead of ""believe all women"" it'll reach equalibrium as ""investigate all women"", yaHeard? 😆"
No me too died when former VP Biden was accused.
This verdict wont be the end of MeToo. The movement's apologists' total (and often malicious) refusal to include male victims will be
Hashtag: FlushAmberTurd
"It is my belief there are two truths with the ""me too"" movement. The first is that women are more often abused than men. The second is that there were some women caught up in the movement, who wanted to use the situation to their advantage, whatever that might be"
Someone being found innocent is so chilling. So they believe he should have automatically been found guilty so as to not be chilling? That would have been chilling!
This is really the beginning of a new era.  The #mepoo movement
Never.
But she lied and she didnt stop lieing and he new and he was sick of her lying guess what he's the winner
"#MeToo died when the sharks couldn't get Trump, but were eating democrat after democrat alive."
"9:50 its scary that men have an avenue to defend themselves against possible, (read: more than likely false) accusations in the court of law. Men should be at the mercy of a woman's words."
"Woman has way to much power , time for the Man to again the Man"
From MeToo to MeWho?!? In a seconds. 😁
Yes it is the end and Im here for it!!!! Fuck cancel culture.
One lying manipulative Witch doesn't discredit the countless woman that are being abused by their partners.
"Set the bar too high for conviction, and you'll have rapists slip free. Set it too low, and you end up with innocent people in jail where they will most likely be the victim of abuse. Wish I could get someone to explain why these high-ups think one casualty is more acceptable than the other and exactly how many do they consider worth it to get what they want."
"I hate the people who say that both of them were abusive. Like, no they weren’t stfu. Just say you didn’t watch the trials and are biased against men cuz you believe woke propaganda smh."
"Honestly the Me Too movement became like Gustav the goldfish, that one Dr seuss story you've never heard about. It started off small, but overfeeding it led to problems down the line."
Is a million alpacas called an alpacalypse?
Naw just the start of the #MeLied movement
In the last 20 years humanity consolidated my creed that we love to hate.
One thing the trial definitely did was give the world some great entertainment
Wow. Thanks Chris and crew. I had almost forgot about Thundar the barbarian and what a great cartoon it was...
"Everyone could see, that she was lying. Especially with the pledged donations and TMZ alert 😂
She photoshopped her bruises and no one saw any bruises. No friends who came to support her!"
"When you make a women’s movement on Twitter to address sexual violence, but realize most adults read the hashtag #️⃣ as a pound sign, and you named your women’s movement #metoo"
"Am I thee only person who barely followed this because I straight out just don’t care? Sure I know some highlights but incase no one noticed. The economy is in the tubes, gas is threw the roof, our border is wide open, the democrats are trying to destroy the country, and a war is on in Ukraine. Imagine asking fleeing refugees from Ukraine how they feel about this case. Me “ did you watch the Amber heard and Johnny Depp trial.” Ukrainian refugee “ I was going to but the Russians blew up my house”."
"Real talk, I'd watch ""Alpaca Unshorn"" for about five minutes, at least."
here's a weird thought maybe metoo should also involve men
That question about the alpacas was just hilarious I can't believe she asked that.
"Women (and men) who've been abused need a voice. If #MeToo decides to stand for justice for all, I'll be more than happy supporting it."
"End of Me Too, and continuation of ridiculous ""White privilege."""
wow this was exactly how i thought metoo woke stuff was going to end.
"#MeToo Chris, I want to see the end of this trial"
"The Red Pill is in the air.  And it is not love.
Excelent!"
"Uuugggghhhh come on people it's literally been a day and we've gone from ""wow a man won a case (which, to avoid the drama and her existence altogether, he didn't even want to level at his ex, completely understandable) when she went after his reputation"" to ""don't believe the women anymore, they're all amber heard""

What the hell happened overnight? I didn't even think #MeToo was still a thing to pin anymore, now people are so desperate to be better than someone else, they'll drag an old media fad out of the garbage to beat it with a stick and point and laugh at it with others.

Note: Amber Heard's quote about ""setting the clock back"" to a time when women can't speak ""freely and openly"" makes me angry. Hearing that from someone who can't utter three sentences in court _honestly_ is a joke. The captions not getting Heard's name right and listing it as ""hurt"" or ""herd"" most of the time is surprisingly satisfying."
2:26 I like how almost everyone will understand that reference
"When you said ""defamation"" .. I heard ""defecation"""
No no case or some B rated actress is the end of a movement.  Heard thinking everything is all about her is the most funny thing I've heard. The me too movement didn't start with her or will end with her.
"Liebe Community,

wir freuen uns über die rege, differenzierte Diskussion unter diesem Video. Zwei Hinweise:

1. Wir wissen, dass dieses Thema polarisiert. Das rechtfertigt jedoch nicht, dass einige hier in den Kommentaren auf die im Film gezeigten Personen schimpfen und sie teilweise unsachlich beleidigen. Bitte bleibt fair und konstruktiv. Danke.

2. Bei 17:09 ist natürlich der 13.11.2021 und nicht der 13.11.2022 gemeint. Das haben einige von Euch bemerkt, Danke für die Hinweise. Ist natürlich ein Fehler - leider haben wir noch keine Zeitmaschine erfunden! 🙃

Viele Grüße aus der ZAPP-Redaktion!"
"Die Aktivistin behauptet, ein vorverurteilender Vorwurf könne keine Karriere beenden. Und fordert gleichzeitig den Arbeitgeber auf, die Karriere zu beenden."
"Man kann schwer sagen, ob Luke oder Lukes Freundin Recht haben, aber man kann sagen, dass die Aktivistin ganz sicher Unrecht hat."
"Ich erinnere mich noch gut daran, wie über die Luke-Sache berichtet wurde und Jorinde sich dann darüber aufgeregt hat dass ihr Name nicht genannt wurde. Das sagt auch schon viel über sie aus."
"Wow... selten haben mich Menschen in Dokus so negativ getriggert, wie diese selbsternannte ""Aktivistin""...was die sich zusammenspinnt und rausnimmt! Unfassbar!"
Die Aktivistin könnte kaum unsympathischer sein. Das sie ihr eigenes Anliegen durch ihre Ignoranz nur diskreditiert merkt sie nicht.
"3:54 ""Ich fand das sehr glaubwürdig und es ging mir sehr nah... Weil die erzählte Gewalt sehr schlimm war und es viel Mut braucht"" 
13:26 ""Schon als der Podcast rauskam, hatte sie eine Ahnung"" 13:39 - 13:58 ""Wir haben gesehen, dass die Vorwürfe immer wieder kamen""
Wie kann man jemanden durch Ahnung und Vorwürfen derart belasten? Ist das die moderne Art der Beweisführung?"
"Also die Aktivistin finde ich wirklich etwas fragwürdig... Ich finde nicht dass sie objektiv bleibt oder realistisch. Und gerade das wäre für eine offizielle Stellungnahme bei diesem Thema unendlich wichtig - wenn es auch schwer ist (ich kann verstehen, dass man erst mal auf der Seite der vermeintlichen Opfers ist). Wenn man aber etwas darüber nachdenkt, muss man zugeben dass man als Außenstehende überhaupt nichts dazu sagen kann, das irgendwie gewinnbringend ist. Ich finde man sollte sich wirklich einen Moment lang überlegen, ob man einem Menschen des offiziellen Lebens öffentlich so tiefgreifend persönliche Vorwürfe macht. Ich will mir kein Urteil erlauben."
"Dieser ""Aktivistin"" sollte man keine Plattform geben."
"Möchte Mockridge nicht verteidigen, aber ich finde es erschreckend, dass jemand einfach irgendwas erzählen kann und es von der Mehrheit nicht mehr hinterfragt wird. 
Das ist nicht ok."
"Ich kann nicht fassen was die Aktivistin bei 6:45 gesagt hat. Wie kann man nur so ignorant und schlichtweg verachtend sein? Sie hat im Leben wohl noch nie 1 mm über ihren eigenen Tellerrand geschaut und über anderes Leid als ihr eigenes nachgedacht. Diese Frau kennt keine Empathie, kein Mitgefühlt. Ihr geht es nicht um die Opfer von sexueller Gewalt sondern darum, ihre eigene moralische Überlegenheit zu inszenieren und ihrem Leben einen Sinn zu geben."
"Die vorletzte Folge vom Podcast „Alles muss raus“ von Thilo Mischke ist mit Ines Anioli. Und da sagt sie, dass dieser Haschtag sie überrascht hat und berichtet, wie es ihr damit ging. Fand ich super spannend und zeigte auch, wie wenig es Jorinde Wiese um Ines als Betroffene ging."
"Wenn die Aktivistin es so unproblematisch findet, dass man einfach mal als potentielles Opfer nen Vorwurf in den Raum stellt, dann würde es mich interessieren, wie sie drauf reagiert, wenn jemand behauptet sie hätte ihn als Kind missbraucht. Immer schön vom potentiellen Opfer her gedacht, dürfte es ihr nichts ausmachen, sie könnte ja reagieren.
Was bleibt ist allerdings das Problem, dass bei Gewalt, und besonders bei sexualisierter Gewalt, Opfer meist in der schwachen Position sind und wenig Chancen haben, zu ihrem Recht zu kommen. Die Methoden solcher AktivistInnen halte ich dennoch für falsch."
"Das Problem bei der Aktivistin ist, dass sie da selbst zu sehr drin steckt, die hat da ein persönliches Rachemotiv weswegen die sich so einsetzt. Das ist nicht neutral genug und daher ausschließlich destruktiv."
"Ich finde das Problem ist, man weiß es nicht bei Situationen bei denen Aussage gegen Aussage geht und schon gar nicht als ausenstehende Person über Social Media.
Alles was bleibt um sich auf eine Seite zu stellen sind, Sympatie einer Partei gegenüber, sowie seine eigenen negativen Erfahrung mit dem Thema welches man schnell darauf projiziert, obwohl es nichts handfestes gibt, dass es genau so sein muss. Schnelle Anschuldigungen entbrennen auf Social Media oft ein Lauffeuer, welche nicht mehr aufzuhalten ist.
Das beste ist manchmal auch. Als Außenstehender erstmal langsamer zu machen und die Ermittler ihren Job machen zu lassen
(Ohne jetzt jemanden in schutz zu nehmen oder zu attackieren!)"
"Die Dame ""Jorinde"" soll Mal klarkommen, wie kann sie so über jemanden sprechen, den sie nicht kennt? Sie weiß nicht, ob er es getan hat oder nicht..
Im Zweifel für den Angeklagten!"
"Jorinde Wiese (die Aktivistin) hat mich enttäuscht, ich hatte ehrlich gesagt irgendwie etwas stichhaltigeres als ""Wieso sollte ich mich mit dem Täter beschäftigen?"" erwartet. Das Täter -> Opfer Verhältnis existiert ja in beiden Richtungen. Je nachdem ob der Vorwurf ""Wahr"" oder ""Falsch"" ist. Da hätte ich mir mehr Umsichtigkeit Ihrerseits gewünscht.  


Ich habe das Thema ""Selbstöffnung"" nicht richtig verstanden. Kann das nochmal jemand erläutern? 

Simon Bergmann (den Anwalt) finde ich Gruselig,  der dann ""Warnungen"" präventiv verschickt. Typisch Anwalt.

Alles in allem ein spannender Beitrag, ich hoffe Sie bleiben da dran, ich bin (mir persönlich) auch immer noch nicht sicher was ich davon halten soll. Wirklich eine verstrickte Situation. 


PS: Wie genau fand denn Datenerfassung bei Reddit statt? Dort gibt es doch keine Hashtags?"
"@06:40 Sehr befremdlich, wenn Aktivistinnen wie Frau Wiese eine Plattform gegeben wird. Der Vorwurf sexualisierte Gewalt ausgeübt zu haben - ob gerechtfertigt oder nicht - ist praktisch der folgenschwerste Vorwurf, den man gegenüber einer Person des öffentlichen Lebens machen kann. Dafür gibt es auch genügend Beispiele, die jeder Aktivistin bekannt sein sollte. 
Die Art und Weise, wie Frau Wiese damit umgeht (""man kann da ja drauf reagieren"",  ""ist das wirklich das schlimmste?"") zeigt, dass Frau Wiese entweder komplett Naiv ist oder das ganze als eine Art lustiges Spiel sieht mit dem sie ein paar Likes generieren kann. 
Bei Männern wird nur die Karriere ruiniert, aber der massive Schaden, den Frau Wiese auf Dauer bei den echten (!) Aktivistinnen anrichtet, wird am Ende wesentlich größer sein..."
"Schade, kann ich nach 7 Minuten nicht zuende schauen. Ich möchte nicht zu viel Hass auf diese schreckliche ""Aktivistin"" entwickeln. Wieso zum Teufel bekommt solch eine Person die Bühne?"
"Frau Wiese versteht die Thematik der Vorverurteilung erst dann, wenn sie selbst Opfer von Vorverurteilung wird. Selbstherrliche Frau, welche die Justiz selbst in die Hand nimmt und der scheinbar jegliche Empathie fehlt."
"Die Vorstellung, dass man selber entscheiden darf ob jemand schuldig ist oder nicht ist einfach nur krank was stimmt mit der Aktivisten nicht?"
"Ein sehr schwieriger Fall. Einerseits ist es schwierig eine Person öffentlich so zu verurteilen, andererseits ist es furchtbar wenn Opfern nicht geglaubt und sogar gegen sie gehetzt wird. Sexualisierte Gewalt kann ja in vielen Fällen nicht nachgewiesen werden.. sehr schwierig. Andererseits: jede dritte Frau in Deutschland hat Erfahrungen mit Gewalt, also unwahrscheinlich ist es nicht dass Ines betroffen ist.."
"Die Aktivistin finde ich problematisch, sie wirkt eher ""Männerfeindich"" , unreflektiert und voreingenommen...."
"Also diese Aktivistin finde ich schwierig. Hätte mir von Seiten Zapp eine kritischere Betrachtung gewünscht. 
Insbesondere die Argumente von ihr als sie zum Thema vorverurteilung gesprochen hat.

Wir haben ja im Fall Kachelmann und Türck gesehen das es große Auswirkungen auf die betroffenen hat .

Wie kann man dann ruhigen Gewissen eine solche Kampagne machen."
"Liebes ZAPP-Team,
danke, dass Sie die Chronologie des Falls Luke Mockridge einmal für alle aufgearbeitet habt. So etwas ist wichtig! Ich würde mir wünschen, dass Sie auf die selbe Art und Weise den Fall Jorinde Wiese und die sich häufenden Vorwürfe gegen diese Person aufarbeiten, nachdem Sie ihr eine so große Plattform gegeben haben."
"Jorinde Wiese stellt sich hier wirklich nicht gut da. Engstirnig, einseitig und sehr wenig durchdachte Aussagen und Aktionen. Genau das Verhalten was sie an den Tag legt hat zur Folge, dass viele Menschen vom Feminismus abgeschreckt werden."
"die Aktivistin ist sich glaub ich ihrem Handeln gar nicht so bewusst. Die Aussage , es gäbe etliche schlimmere Vorwürfe, die an einem haften können, finde ich schwierig , denn ich finde es wurde mit einer leichtfertigkeit eine ganze Karriere eines Menschen zerstört."
wie glücklich jorinde ist weil sie aufmerksamkeit bekommt. Ich finde die frau ist krank.
"Jorinde Wiese ist die Art Mensch, die anfängt, dich anzukreischen, wenn sie in ner Diskussion den kürzeren zieht lol"
"6:20 - Also bei allem Respekt, aber diese Aussage verstehe ich nicht... In einem Moment ist sexuelle Gewalt das Schlimmste was passieren kann, aber dann ist der Vorwurf angeblich ja doch nicht so schlimm. Ich finde ihre Motivation sehr lobenswert, gleichzeitig scheint sie etwas unreflektiert an die Situation ranzugehen"
Einfach so unsympathisch diese Jorinde!
"6:41 Ja, es ist der schlimmste Vorwurf den ein Mann haben kann. Komm in der Realität an."
Empfinde die AktivistIn sehr unangenehm
Es gibt viele Vorwürfe gegenüber Jorinde Wiese. Wie der Veruntreuung vom Spendengeldern. Ich wünschte man würde diese Person stärker diskutieren.
"euren beitrag fand ich sehr interessant und, sofern das in dieser situation überhaupt möglich ist, auch sehr ausgewogen und neutral, großes lob dafür. 

Ich habe selbst in einer vergangen Beziehung übergriffiges Verhalten erlebt und zu sehen, wie Jorinde Wiese so unreflektiert über die ganze Situation spricht, finde ich unfassbar. Mit Hashtags, Selbstbeweihräucherung und diesem 'ich leide ja auch für die Opfer mit'-Ton hilft man niemandem und ich würde mir wünschen, dass solchen Leuten nicht auch noch eine Plattform geboten wird. Hilfreicher und informativer fände ich Stimmen von SozialarbeiterInnen oder Menschen, die auch mit Opfern von Gewalt arbeiten (und nicht nur auf Social Media posten, wie empört sie sind)."
6:16 Meinst die das ernst? Das sind ihre Argumente? Oh Gott. Die hat offensichtlich noch nie was vom Fall Kachelmann gehört.
"""Ich verstehe den Fokus nicht.""
Genau das ist das elementare Problem. 
Das mangelnde Verständnis dafür, dass ein vermeintliches Opfer Täter, und ein vermeintlicher Täter Opfer sein kann. Und dass eben nicht nur vermeintliche Opfer, sondern auch vermeintliche Täter bis zum Nachweis ihrer Tat nicht stigmatisiert, ausgegrenzt oder verleumdet werden dürfen."
Finde es bei der Aktivistin sehr fadenscheinig. Ich glaube sie macht das nur für sich.
"Die ganze Situation ist  eine Katastrophe. Beide tun mir leid, aber die Öffentlichkeit hat damit nichts zu tun. Wer seine Meinung dazu äußert, war weder dabei noch hat diese Person das Recht dazu."
Solche Anschuldigungen. Hören Karrieren auf? Ist das das schlimmste? Also diese Aktivistin hat wirklich den Schuss nicht gehört…
"„Ich denke an Verantwortlichkeit nicht gegenüber mutmaßlichen Tätern, sondern gegenüber Betroffenen.“
Dieser Satz löst so eine Wut in mir aus. Dann noch dieses fiese Grinsen dabei. Es ist gar nicht schön, wenn man um etwas beschuldigt wird, was jemand nur um Aufmerksamkeit zu erlangen behauptet. Sehr viele gucken dich verachtend an und reden über dich schlimmen Finger. Als einer, der das schon erlebt hat und sich die Sache 2 Jahre später als: „ich wollte ja nur Spaß machen, ich fand ihn ja ganz süß“ entpuppt hat, kann ich nur sagen: Frau Wiese es gehören immer zwei Seiten zu so einer Geschichte und hier Partei zu ergreifen ist falsch. Ich sage: im Zweifel für den Angeklagten ist vollkommen richtig. Schade um die Opfer ja, aber dafür in Kauf nehmen den falschen hinter Gitter zu sperren für ein Example? Noch schlimmer!"
Unabhaengig vom gesamten Diskurs ist die Aktivistin hart unsympathisch
Vielleicht sollte Zapp mal die Aktivistin Wiese durchleuchten und ihre Machenschaften?! Schade das man sie für diesen Beitrag der Aufklärung hinzugezogen hat..
"Es ist absolut fatal, dass sich Menschen eine Meinung bilden, obwohl sie nicht dabei waren! Luke tut mir heute noch leid!"
Die AktivistIn finde ich sehr unsympathisch. Sie hat eine unangenehme Ausstrahlung.
Ich finde aufgrund des Videos von @DedectiveUnico solltet ihr diesen Beitrag noch einmal gründlich Überdenken und gegebenenfalls überarbeiten/ eine reflektierende Sequenz hinzufügen
"Vorverurteilung und viel zu voreilig Meinungsbildung ist heute ein massives Problem und dazu tragen auch die öffentlich rechtlichen bei.
Ständig wird über jemanden gesprochen aber nicht mit jemandem."
"Unglaublich 🤨 
Ich kanns nicht zu Ende sehen, das massive Fremdschämen ist so unangenehm..."
"„Ist das der schlimmste Vorwurf, den man haben kann, dass man sexualisierte Gewalt ausgeübt hat? Also es Gibt ja auch andere Vorwürfe. Und auf jeden kann man reagieren, wenn sie falsch sind.“

Alleine diese Aussage ist schon sehr Wirklichkeitsfremd."
"Dieser Aktivistin eine Plattform zu geben ist höchst bedenklich. Zwar wurde sie hier aufgeführt, um die Chronologie besser nachvollziehen zu können, allerdings sollte hierbei stark abgewogen werden, ob man sie auch selbst reden lässt und ihr somit Raum einräumt. Auf dem Kanal ""DramaDetective"" gibt es einen sehr ernstzunehmenden Beitrag über sie."
Das Problem bei solchen öffentlichen Debatten ist das die nicht öffentlich geführt werden sollte .. hilft Opfer nicht !!!!
Wie wäre es mal mit KonsequenzenfürJorinde?
"Eigentlich sollte man die Aktivistin verklagen, das ist absolute Rufschädigung und muss bestraft werden. Es kann nicht sein, das Leben und Karrieren beschädigt werden ohne Beweise!"
"Wieder ein guter Beitrag von ZAPP.
Der Aktivistin werfe ich mangelnde Sorgfalt vor. Der oder die Beschuldigte könnten sich als unschuldig herausstellen und großen Imageschaden erleiden.
Unbewiesene Behauptungen von Ex-Partnerinnen muss man mit großer Vorsicht behandeln. Da können verschiedene Beweggründe eine Rolle spielen.
Es gab auch schon falsche Vorwürfe vor Gericht und großen Schaden bei Unschuldigen. Der Fall Jörg Kachelmann ist ein Beispiel."
"Nun, die aktuellen Ereignisse zeigen ja, dass bei Ines Anioli durchaus Skepsis angebracht ist."
"Diese Aktivistin ist ein typisches Beispiel für Menschen, die die Welt nicht braucht."
"Genau so stelle ich mir eine ""Aktivistin"" zu solch einem Thema vor!  Vorurteil zu 100% bestätigt 😅"
"Als Aktivist*in sollte man erst die eigene Geschichte verarbeiten. Man merkt, dass hier viel zu viel Wut im Spiel ist. Und das ist nicht mehr objektiv, sondern gefährlich. Nicht cool!"
"Also Jorinde Wiese hat doch den Schuss nicht gehört. Ja klar, ich finde den Opferschutz auch wichtiger, als den Täterschutz, aber wenn nicht klar ist, ob eine Tat überhaupt stattgefunden hat, gilt erstmam die Unschuldsvermutung und wenn jemand zu Unrecht beschuldigt wurde, dann ist diese Person auch ein Opfer!  Siehe 6:20"
"Frau Nina Kirsch hat mal ein Video über die ""Aktivistin Jorinde Wiese"" gemacht. Die Wiese ist alles andere als eine Vorbildsfunktion."
"Ich bin der Meinung, also ich persönlich, wenn mir jemand  Gewalt antut, melde ich es eigentlich sofort. Und nicht 2 Jahre später."
Schön dass die Aktivistin die ganze Zeit grinsen muss bei dem Thema und den Fokus nicht verstehen kann das beschuldigte ein recht auf Fairness haben.
"Frau Wiese hat vermutlich im Grundsatz gute Absichten aber sieht nicht, dass sie mit ihrem Tunnelblick (sieht nur das was sie sehen will) das Leben und die Karriere eines Menschen belastest, ohne schlussendlich zu wissen was passiert ist. Sie trägt ihre Überzeugungen und ihre Werte am Rücken eines womöglich Unschuldigen aus. Das ist nicht nur schade sondern auch beschämend. Finde ich schwach die andere Seite komplett zu ignorieren."
"Wie gut , daß unser Rechtssystem nicht auf den Ansichten dieser 'Aktivistin' basiert. Sie geniesst hier sogar mehr Respekt, als Sie selber jemand anderem zugesteht."
Ich finde es sehr kritisch wenn Moral das Recht als bloße Nebensache aushebelt. Haben wir denn nicht gerade unseren Rechtsstaat um eben auf solch ein Moral- und damit Cancel-Theater verzichten zu können?
Ich glaube wirklich hier Parallelen zu dem Fall Kachelmann zu erkennen.
"6:52
Echt? 
Ja, echt!

Tu nicht so auf naiv. Wer bei sowas lügt und einem die ganze Karriere damit zerstört, sollte in den Bau gehen, und das nicht zu kurz."
"Was ja eigentlich schon völlig merkwürdig ist, ist dass Menschen, die von einem solchen Vorwurf hören nicht Unterstützung anbieten und raten Anzeige zu erstatten, sondern öffentlich Konsequenzen zu fordern ohne zu wissen, ob es überhaupt stimmt"
Verleumdung ist eine der schlimmsten Straftaten. Möge die Justiz der Frau einer gerechten Strafe zuführen!
"Mir ist die Dame ab Minute 6 sehr unsympathisch. Ich kann es nachvollziehen, dass man Gerechtigkeit möchte für Opfer von Sexualisierter Gewalt, warum man deswegen prinzipiell den mutmaßlichen Täter diffamiert ist mir schleierhaft. Zweimal Unrecht gibt doch noch lang keine Gerechtigkeit, zumal wir dafür die Rechtsprechung haben."
"Frau Wiese scheint hier sehr seltsam über viele Dinge zu denken. Vielleicht denkt sie auch gar nicht über das, was sie in diesem Interview sagt. Dieses Dauerlächeln und das ja achso bewusste Auskennen mit allem macht sie nicht weniger Unglaubwürdig und anzweifelbar. Naja ich möche hier ja niemanden bashen, aber ich glaube, dass da andere Menschen eventuell etwas sinnvolleres zu sagen könnten."
"ich hielt euch mal für seriös. Aber dass ihre Jorinde Wiese ausgewählt habt um hier zu sprechen, lässt mich daran doch sehr sehr zweifeln"
"Boah, diese kurzharige Frau ist genau die Art von Personen die ich überhaupt nicht mag."
Die Aktivistin habe ich mir exakt so vorgestellt
"Sehr schön,  das andere Leute Menschen auf Ideen bringen, die es ohne sie SO gar nicht gäbe. Entweder klär ich das rechtlich für mich selbst, aber hier läuft es von Grund auf falsch, Punkt!"
Ihr hättet das mehr als fragwürdige und fahrlässige Verhalten der Aktivistin ruhig mal hinterfragen können.
Twitter ist wirklich eine Hölle. Ich bin da nicht mehr häufig. Ein einziges Irrenhaus.
"Statt in Lager zu denken+kommentieren, wäre es sinnvoller darüber zu diskutieren was Opfer sexueller Gewalt für Möglichkeiten haben. 

Erst einmal den Mut aufbringen so etwas zur Anzeige zu bringen, anschließend zu beweisen. Aussage gegen Aussage.

Vermutlich fällt es einem teil der Gesellschaft leichter, wenn der Täter einfach ein Migrant ist. Ein weißer Promi der die Menschen zum lachen bringt passt halt nicht ins Profil."
"Es gab zwei gerichtliche Instanzen, welche Aniolis Anzeige zurückwiesen. Es stand sogar im Raum, das Angaben Aniolis widersprüchlich gewesen seien. Kein Wort hier bei Zapp über diesen Umstand. Bild hatte dazu noch berichtet, dass Anioli in der Vergangenheit schon mal einen Prominenten der Vergewaltigung bezichtigt hatte und eine Unterlassungsverfügung unterschreiben musste. Auch kein Wort bein Zapp darüber. Finde diesen Beitrag sehr einseitig."
"Hab diese Doku erst jetzt gesehen. Auf jeden Fall spannend. Ich finde es unglaublich, wie sich einzelne Personen das Recht nehmen, andere Personen aufgrund von Anschuldigungen schon vorzuverurteilen und dann einen sogenannten ""Krieg"" gegen ihn zu führen. Ich frage mich ehrlich, was sie das angeht und wieso sie meint, dass sie das Recht dazu hat sich in dem Fall so ""einzumischen"".
Und auch ihre Begründung fand ich total daneben. Ja, es ist schlimm und ja, Karrieren hören aus diesen Gründen auf.(sieht man gut im Fall Amber vs. Depp) Man wird den Stempel nie wieder los. 
Ich finde es absolut unmöglich, sowas im TV auszusagen.
Schlussendlich wissen wir alle nicht, was da genau vorgefallen ist."
"Ich finde das so zum kotzen, dass Frauen mit solchen Anschuldigungen den Ruf des Mannes für immer zerstörten können!!!"
"Jorinde Wiese 6:30 tut der ,,me too"" Bewegung damit echt keinen Gefallen"
"Vorverurteilungen und Ausgrenzung ist doch mit der Weile alltäglich und normal und alle machen sie brav mit, ob es in der Politik oder in den Medien. Alle sind sie dabei um sich Vorteile zu verschaffen und das teileweise auch politisch gewollt! Ich denke da nur an Kachelmann oder auch in vielen anderen Bereichen."
"Hallo ZAPP-Redaktion, ich hoffe nach dem heute erschienenen Video seht ihr endlich, was für einer Person ihr da eine Bühne gegeben habt und nehmt das Video schnellst möglich wieder runter :)"
"Mit der Aussage von Mockridge, dass die Vorwürfe eher in eine Paartherapie gehören, belegen, dass die Vorwürfe wahr sind."
Aberkennung von Rechtsstaatlichkeit hat nichts mit Aktivismus zu tun--liebe Jorinde Wiese...
Also die Einstellung der Aktivist dazu jemanden Öffentlich vorzuverurteilen finde ich extrem unsensibel und verwerflich.
"Für alle, die hier wieder nur auf dem Fall Kachelmann herumreiten:
Zitat Jörg Kachelmann 24. September 2021 auf Twitter: Ich verwahre mich dagegen, dass mein Schicksal dafür verwendet wird, Opfer sexualisierter Gewalt zu delegitimieren. Meine Solidarität ist immer bei diesen Opfern und was mir passiert ist, eignet sich nicht zu Verallgemeinerungen irgendwelcher Art."
Es wird einfach ein Stempel drauf gedrückt und den wirst du niemals los! Wirklich NIEMALS!!
6:40 Wtf also diese Frau Wiese war ja noch relativ glaubwürdig bis sie das Ausmass des Vorwurfes der sexualisierten Gewalt relativierte. Wo ist denn überhaupt die Logik? Sie betont zigmal wie schlimm ein solcher Akt ist (wo ich ihr auch zustimme) und sagt aber der Vorwurf sei gar nicht so schlimm? Macht ja absolut gar keinen Sinn und das hat ihre Glaubwürdigkeit direkt komplett zerstört.
"Unabhängig davon ob es jetzt passier ist, was labert denn die Aktivistin zu Beginn? Dass es niemanden schadet wenn man solche Vorwürfe bekommt? Was ist dann mit den ganzen Schauspieler geworden bei denen das rausgekommen ist? Und von mockridge hab ich auch nichts mehr gehört. Obwohl er freigesprochen ist ist seine Karriere schon zerstört. Oder auch Maryland manson. Ein vorwurf und alle hören auf mit ihm zu arbeiten. Es gibt eigentlich nichts schlimmeres. Ich denke wenn du jemanden als öffentliche Person umbringst kommst du fast besser davon."
"Laut der Aktivistin soll es also ernst genommen werden.. wieso feiert sie sich dann so während sie darüber spricht? 
Ja, man sollte so etwas ernst nehmen, aber die Wiese macht sich nur wichtig, sorry"
"Der Auftritt bei Kiwi reicht, um ihn nicht mehr zu mögen. Promisohn wie Gil Ofarim."
"Was mir im Beitrag völlig fehlt, ist ein Auseinandersetzung mit der Frage, ob Menschen gegen die (relativ viele) solcher Vorwürfe erhoben werden, derart große Bühnen geboten werden sollten?  

Diese Frage ist aber weit größer als der Fall Mockridge, weil es dabei auch um die gesellschaftliche Verantwortung von Sendern und Veranstaltern geht. Wussten die entscheidenden Personen davon, dass ihr Star womöglich immer wieder die Grenzen anderer Menschen überschreitet? Und wie steht die Öffentlichkeit dazu, wenn das so ist? Das muss verhandelt werden - aber nicht vor einem Gericht sondern in einer öffentlichen Debatte. 

Es geht also nicht ""nur"" um Recht oder Unrecht für Opfer/Täter in diesem Fall. Es geht um ethische Maßstäbe, die überall in unserer Gesellschaft gelten sollten - unabhängig von Prominenz, Status, Macht. Eine freie Gesellschaft muss sich also öffentlich an diesem Überthema abarbeiten dürfen - jedoch nicht nur abstrakt sondern gerade auch an konkreten Beispielen, wie dem Fall Mockridge. Schlicht weil diese wichtige Diskussion sonst immer auf der Metaebene an den Unis stecken bleiben wird und sich die breite Öffentlichkeit nicht damit auseinandersetzen und sich entsprechend empören oder gegenreden würde. Ich sehe es wie der Spiegel und Frau Müller: Es ist die (ethische) Aufgabe des Journalismus, eine Öffentlichkeit her zu stellen und damit eine Auseinandersetzung vieler Menschen mit diesem Thema anzuregen und zu ermöglichen - unabhängig von der möglichen Reaktion der Menschen darauf. 

Die Öffentlichkeit muss durch diese Debatte die Chance bekommen, MedienmacherInnen und allen anderen zu zu rufen: ""Eure ethischen Maßstäbe sind ungenügend. Helden mit über Jahre massiv übergriffigem - wenn auch strafrechtlich nicht relevanten - Verhalten wollen wir nicht - be better!"" Und diese Dimension hat einfach rein gar nichts damit zu tun, dass ""eine Verurteilung nicht wahrscheinlicher gewesen sei, als ein Freispruch""."
Ich frage mich warum meistens von Vergewaltigung geredet wird wenn der begangene Rufmord nichtmal Vergewaltigung beinhaltet.
"War Frau Kroymann persönlich bei den behaupteten Übergriffen dabei? Ihre Aussage finde ich auch übel vorverurteilend und verantwortungslos. Mich nervt diese aktuelle Empörungskultur gewaltig. Verschweigen ist selbstverständlich keine Option. Unbedacht beschuldigen allerdings auch nicht. Man denke diese Verhaltensweise nur mal konsequent zu Ende.
Herzlichen Dank für Ihr Schlusswort! Wie lange dauerte es bis zur vollständigen Gerechtigkeit im Fall von Jörg Kachelmann. Ich weiß, dass ich mich mit folgender Aussage richtig weit aus dem Fenster lehne, aber jede erfundene Anschuldigung ist eine zuviel und dient gerade nicht der wirklich guten Sache. Nämlich der Gerechtigkeit und der Aufklärung. Übrigens ist auch jeder sexuelle Übergriff einer zuviel."
"Der Fall zeigte mal wieder, dass die Unschuldsvermutung in Deutschland kaum noch etwas wert ist."
"Wie sich die Männer hier teils grezwertig auf die Aktivistin stürzen, das sagt viel über deren Weltbild aus. 
Sätze wie ""Ich weiß schon gar nicht mehr wie ich mich gegenüber Frauen benehmen darf"" ist in deren Sprachgebrauch."
"Jorinde Wiese ist ja schlimm und 0,0 reflektiert. Hast noch ne Menge zu lernen."
"06:40 Natürlich ist das das Schlimmste! Und natürlich werden so Karrieren bzw. Existenzen kaputt gemacht. Wenn sich der Vorwurf des sexuellen Missbrauchs nicht nachweisen lässt, ist einfach vom Gegenteil auszugehen."
Ummm...where is the real founder of the Me Too movement Tarana Burke who started it way before celebrities got involved.
The problem is when accusations are not true. That's the most damaging issue.  Accountability needs to increase for both sides.
I thought the movement was failing especially since the major activists were being accused themselves.
"Most of the things she said are correct, but people still need to acknowledge false accusations."
Where did all the men go?
What about the stories of how the me too movement has ruined the many lives of innocent men. I know of two who falsely accused and did prison time for the allegations because the women involved felt it was easier to say they were sexually assaulted then admit the kind of person they really are.... Psychotic drug addicts. I know there are real women with real stories of this. But please don't make it seem like it's all one sided.
"Yep, 90% of the ""stories"" are like, ""Omg, he r'ped with his eyes on the train. I felt so violated that I cried for days afterwards,"" or, ""He brushed up against me. It was only for a second and the party was really crowded. But I just know he did it on purpose. It happened twenty years ago. But only now I feel as though I can tell my story. Thank you, Me2! Oh, and btw, he should obviously be fired from his job."""
Seems the next thing will be to make sure transwoman are believed. I am sure there will be no false accusations.
"Done great things!!! That's why EVERYONE flying epstein air are still walking free.

"Tarana Burke, thank you for all that you’ve done and continue to do to bring light to this issue."

can metoo describe what a woman is?
Only applies if you are a good democrat and follow the party line as you are told.
Have Chris Matthews interview Al franken they are both experts
"USA, I'm doing great 💯
How are you? ❤️"
It helps to have more women professionals in positions of leadership.
A long way to go

I like how much of the me too stuff turned out to be fake.
4:25 is how I remember a lot of school life.

Johnny Depp winning is also a Me Too moment. So glad for him speaking out about his abuse.
Ryan is incorrect here. It wasn't like there was a huge support for Depp initially so it's not like there were all these people looking for his innocence. The number of people that supported him grew  as the case got presented. In the beginning Amber had most of the public support and Depp was cancelled without being able to tell his story while Amber got to film Aquaman 2. With the victory he will most likely be able to get movie roles again now that he is more popular than ever.
Women domestic abuse against men doesn’t get reported like men to women.. women casually hit men in frustration and think it’s okay and some men just allow it.
Great guest. She seemed very fair and balance.
I’m glad he won. These women need to be more accountable with their lies.
Asra Nomani has such a positive energy; it was a delight to listen to her speak.
Believe all women has got to be one of the craziest ideas ever
"Ryan, the reason this strikes a chord with so many women is that we're sensitive to being abused and then gaslit about it."
"I was made a monster in Finland about 35 years ago, when in fact my Ex was the real monster.....in the court nobody wanted to give me a voice at all....she lie, made stories and try to set me up and she told my Mother, that she is going to do all she can to destroy my life and only because I took a divorce.    Also what Ryan is saying, that 90% of abuse done is from men is completely wrong, and even about 2 years ago the Finnish official report from the police department told, that they had come to the conclusion, that in these days over 50% of abusers are women, but that men are shy to report it to the police because then they are kept in the society as looser and made fun of.  Finland is a country with very strong Feminist movement, that has take over most of the politics and Media, so I'm sure that in USA the abuse is higher by men, but never and ever any 90% of cases. We are all humans and there are always going to be bad individuals no matter they are men or women."
Asra spitting nothing but facts
I am amazed at this interpretation.  To me this was a trial about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard.  I am a female and I believed the evidence fell on Johnny's side.  And I sure don't believe that a man winning once takes justice away from women.  Every case should be treated independently.
How sexist to assume that man is always the aggressor.
Washington post & ACLU should be held responsible also.
Victims triumphing over their abusers is not a rebuke of MeToo
"I love her, thank you for having her on today."
"Thanks to your guest, Asra Nomani for being fair and honest."
Ryan would help his party the most by learning when to be quiet.
"Actually studies have shown that women are MORE likely to be the ones who throw the first physical punch when verbal abuse turns to physical violence - it's just that men are stronger on the whole and more deadly. 
Women also tend to use slander and gossip as their form of 'violence' - so I'm glad he won because it was very damaging to his career and in reality that damage to his career, was victim-blaming. 
He should now sue the producers of the movies which dropped him over her unfounded 'allegations'."
Maybe having a reflex action that doesn’t involve considering facts but simply taking the other side to the crowd is not the way things are supposed to be since the age of reason since the 1700
"Thanks to Asra Normani for her take! What I think: I'm not sure Depp's massive support has necessarily a lot to do with the MeToo movement. I mean, certainly in some cases, because I've seen people happy it's exposing the problem with MeToo's ""believe all women"" motto. But I've also seen a lot of supporters who say they're still behind MeToo. It wasn't all Depp fans or ""stans"" (as many in the media keep insisting) because I've seen many who say they didn't like him before. Also, I saw a great many domestic violence survivors (both men and women) coming out for him because they identified with him. What it boils down to is that all sorts of different people supported him because his innocence (and her guilt) was so obvious. He had underdog status because of his troubles in getting the truth out, and everyone loves an underdog! For those on Heard's side, a lot don't seem to have even been following the trial, and it's pretty easy to spot them. Such as the ""experts"" the media's been trotting out to say this puts women back. Those still on her side don't want to give up on the ""believe all women"" thing and/or are the kind who supported her in the beginning and don't want to admit they were wrong."
"Ask men you know if they've been hit by a female partner, then ask women you know the same question about male partners."
I wish someone would've fact checked Ryan's +90%
"The thing that sticks with me the most: what has happened to the ACLU???!!! What an incredible downfall, and so fast too!"
"I like how the Women, who are on the correct side of this issue, basically ignored Ryan’s Wokeness.  Great guest, very personable."
"""Me Too"" &  ""Him too"" cross a line when they go beyond supporting victims"" right to have their voices heard & get their day in court yet ignore the ""innocent until proven guilty"" human right. I'm a DA & SV survivor who watched the entire trial, and feel offended by assertions that the internet &/or JD's fame swayed me. Amber does NOT represent me, and the only ill-will I feel about her is based on her continued insistence that she does! Hear all  her audio tapes."
Ryan you missed the point. And proving people point on Men being abuse isn't taking serious. And people getting falsely accused.
I mean she was lying.
"Dude we've watched all of the evidence. It isn't a sign of meetoo going wrong. 

It was that she was caught lying, that's it.

It's that simple."
"Meanwhile,  hundreds of people, everyday are denied due process in The United States.  Unless your well off, you don't get your day in court"
"If you don't want an overcorrection -- then don't go overboard, in the first place."
"This was profound from Asra, and mirrors what many of us have been yelling at the top of our lungs for the past 5 years. Many of us were behind the idea of the metoo movement originally but came to absolutely HATE IT! It was the worst thing for the very civility of America and beyond. The movement spat in the face of 200+ years of many ppl who fought and died to give us ""a more perfect union."" It absolutely demolished and was antithetical to the fundamental principles for which we stand. It encouraged a ""believe her"" and don't require her to have proof, ALSO, don't question her or investigate at all. The ladder is why it was dangerous and despised by so many, black, white, Hispanic, Indian, and all."
Johnny's over here showing men can be abuse victims here too.  I see that as a win.
"there is a reason Federalist guests are always the best,
you can figure out the rest"
"Paraphrasing what Ryan said “so many women are behind Johnny Depp …. That’s disturbing”…. Why, Ryan? Women can see through BS and appreciate delivering justice regardless of the gender. Do you doubt that?
I normally respect Ryan’s opinions, but surely not in this case. He didn’t make any valid points. Women like Amber Heard hurt actual victims of abuse."
I love this woman! Please bring her back!!!
I expected to be annoyed by Ryan and he didn’t disappoint.
I'm gonna cry. A voice of reason. It's like finding a unicorn these days ;)
"Wow, they actually had on a guest contributor who WASN'T completely insane!"
Love her passion! <3
People don't mind defending women when they are victims. What we don't care for is going on speaking engagements against someone when you are also an abuser is not acceptable.  Due to this is why women can now go to law enforcement and allegations be investigated. Let's be honest the me too spoke women were women that chose to stay silent for fame. The real victims of abuse of power were ignored in the movement.  As for the fans showing up is ridiculous.  Mobs outside courts is just weird. I get press but random people is weird.
Finally! Someone understands the male side! It's not just the one-sided issue. Things really are multifaceted and the mainstream media likes to take one side these days!
Of course Ryan is on team Amber 🤨
This woman is absolutely lovely. Such great energy
Great guest
WOMEN have SONS who may have been falsely accused! But they are supposed to believe guilty until proven innocent? I don’t think so.
Why not bring up MeToo's coverup and protection of Andrew Cuomo?  So disappointed all media refuses to talk about this.
Wow. Incredible woman.
"Yes I want to ""Believe All Victims"" but I need it to be established that they are victims first. Sorry, I am not an omniscient being."
All of these numbers and statistics that I hear people say don’t make sense to me when I personally know and everyone I have talked to personally knows a woman that has used the threat of calling the police and domestic abuse to control the behavior of whatever man is in the relationship.
This get to the heart of the matter! hank you for covering this so thoughtfully and thoroughly. Great job!
A win for all men. Finally!!!!
"Honestly to me, the Me too, was for survivors of DV, not just for women and this shows men are supposed to be a part of this too.  As a survivor myself, this was a breath of fresh air for men too."
"Any normal human knows today how evil women can be.  We all have a neighbor, a friend, a sister, SOMEONE who is an absolute conniving b*tch.  We all know these women.  They're the first to be an 'Amber'.  We are sick of it."
She was great!
"I ❤ ASRA, So very well said! 🇺🇸❤👏"
"I agree with both sides. I want both men and women to get the justice they deserve; that means not automatically believing the woman's claims because her demeanor fits that of a victim, but also not dismissing her claims or refusing to take them seriously because the man in question is more powerful or likable. I hope everyone can agree to this."
"after suffering 4 days of BJG, it's great to hear Ryan's bumbling, stumbling, stuttering 10-minute questions..."
She's awesome
This lady was awesome and very impartial. I hope they have her back on here again soon.
"This trial hit a nerve because many people know women who use the bias towards women in the courts to control their husbands and make sure they never leave them.  Its a pernicious form of bullying and needs to stop.  In sum, women weaponizing the courts against their husbands is a serious issue that needs to be addressed."
"Overall: 90+% the men are abusers in these cass?
I’d really like to see you look up the statistics instead of just guessing. 
Last I saw it was much closer to a 50/50 split. Women are much more likely to be killed by an abusive man than the other way around, but when talking about abuse in general men are not overwhelmingly more likely to be the abuser."
Great guest!
90 % ??? Are you a real reporter ? In Europe you were fired NOW
"And just one note, this DV in our own city was actually closer to 50/50, as per a police detective expressed at a meeting."
"Amber placed her bet on the fact that she's a women and that she automatically would be believed no matter what & now the truth is out that she is the true abuser. The 'Me Too' movement should be ashamed of themselves for siding with a lying sociopath & that aside, they should also include men who are victims of DV not just woman. If it's just a woman's club then that's sexist & proves how biased & hypocritical it is, sounds like it might just be a little Woke to me and a group that sides with the Cancel Culture Mob!!!"
What a fair take on this whole thing ! Nice 😊
This lady 💯
"Fact check: DV is nearly 50/50 across genders. Men tend to be violent slightly more often overall and more damaging when they are. Women tend to initiate one-sided aggression more that can (sometimes) lead to retaliation. By floating ideas that propaganda put in his head, Ryan became part of the complicit media in an ironic twist. Will we get a correction on his 90% statement?"
The final four minutes are the best reasoned take on this.  I hope the big ideas discussed hear just doesn’t disappear
"It was the poop in the bed that tipped the scale, that's just deranged,,,"
"I was always waiting for Ashley Judd, Alyssa Milano, etc to comment on this and support Amber no matter what. I missed it if they did."
"Statically ,female to female relationships have higher levels of abuse than men women relationships,  and the lowest levels is men and men relationships. You can argue that women are more abusive is just when men take action is causes more damage"
"Great Segment! Lower state courts are flooded with domestic abuse cases of which the majority fall apart because people have discovered (mostly women, not always) that because of new laws, calling the police and claiming abuse gives them leverage in their pursuit of gaining complete custody control, gaining sole use of the domicile, or whatever their goals are. Of course there are impactful abuse cases, but they are very few among ALL claims. High levels of resources are utilized to filter through these cases and lives are disrupted for months and sometimes years."
Libs can’t stand losing a culture war.
"More Emily, less Brianna, please!"
Thank-you Arsa great reporting.
"Well, . . . We are clearly not listening to a lawyer."
"The trial WASN'T news, it was a free mini series. It was ENTERTAINMENT! No nobody actors as judge, lawyers, experts and stand-in audience. A few Guest appearances, zoom video on YT? lol I don't see ads but I bet more money was made in advertising than either actor won, combined. LOL It WAS A SHOW!!"
"Men are the abusers more often then not…
Expect if the abuser is a teacher

Based on media… we have a national problem of female teachers being gRapey"
"Many people stay in the constant cycle of abuse is because they cannot ""leave"". Most of the times the reason boils down to finances and whether they can make it out on their own. If one is financially independent, it is easy to leave and not look back. There may be other reasons, but finances seem to be most probable one. All the more reason to stay in school and build up a career."
Anyone who counts on a mob to rectify the injustice of a mob is worse than a fool.
Could it be the he beside toxic masculinity there is also a bit of toxic feminity.  Perish the thought.
The justice for Johnny has been around years with very little following as it wasn’t fashionable to support him. Still her narrative was accepted by the mainstream media. Once they truth came out with the trial and people realized the extent of her liver he started having so much support. What Ryan experienced that if so many people support it something is wrong I felt it with the movement against him.
"Beautifully fair & balanced take from Asra Nomani! 

I hope everyone chills on the Amber trash talk because the world got a little too invested & crazy about this case!

Just hope to see Jack Sparrow in another movie in the future! 🏴‍☠️"
Dave Chappelle predicted a back lash against MeToo
Thank you so much for telling the truth and doing real journalism...You guys are PERFECT :D
I don't see how this represents either side. They're both spoiled brats!
Ryan does not sound like a journalist at all.
Reality check and ethical input by a man of integrity-Ryan
Watched everyday back and forth between LegalBytes and Rakets.
Women accountability = Kryptonite
This guy's hair-do is disturbing
So if you win the case it's truth if you lose its murky?
Ryan do research on lesbian relationship DV then come back with the right number because that 90 percentage lie you just told...
"I’ve watched some woman accuse boyfriends or husbands of abuse when they want out of the verbally abusive manipulation relationship 
Some woman change once they have the guy
I’ve also seen men do the same
It’s scary how people hide their crazy until the relationship is locked in"
Asra Nomani👍love her!🥰
Ryan trying so hard to soy it up
"There is real abuse.  Then there are people who will use that fact to find an advantage for themselves.  Human nature.
Fortunately, we have a court system where fact can be separated from fiction.  (As opposed to the media where fact and fiction are often indistinguishable.)"
"Absolutely, AH became the scape goat. Lucky for JD"

"When will Republican Politicians stop insulting and demeaning the mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, nieces, wives, granddaughters, grandmothers, and treating women like second class citizens?   In November, do a Kansas!   Enough is enough! ✌️💙😞😢😩🇺🇸"

There should also be a movement called Me 3.

Much has changed but have things gotten better?
"Not even close 2 enuf, Ali."
Nope.
Dave Chappelle is right about MeToo.
"Ali is good....but will someone please tell him to relax, he talks with an exaggerated sense of urgency. His tone always unsettles you. Both he and Wolf Blitzer make you want to take a deep breathe and turn off the volume."
Silly. Me too has been around for a 1000 years and it will be for 1000 more.
systemic...you keep using this word...I don't think it means what you think it means...

Tera Reade should have known MeToo only speaks out when the accused is a Republican.🙄

Congratulations to Johnny Depp!!
Johnny Depp should sue the Washington Post
"She, and anyone who falsely accuse others, hurt all real victims of DV."
The lesson is WaPo publishes lies.
The truth’s gonna prevail. Congrats Johnny Depp.
"Congradulations ""CAPTAIN"" Jack Sparrow"
Smartest move … “share with the world Johnny! See if a judge & jury would believe you!!!! “ Quote by AH
And the truth will set you free
She’s going to sue the court for defaming her and sue the jury for punishing her for more money than she has 😂🤣
"Amber tried to use the “me too” movement and “believe all women” crap to cover for her lies!😡.  
Johnny fought her and won!!!   Justice for Johnny❤️"
I hope this case encourages more abused men to come forward. We've all met an Amber heard and they are difficult to deal with even on a good day.
Depp is now officially a super hero. He is “Captain Covid!” His super power “Heard Immunity!”
Defamation trial of Depp vs. Heard teach us that man is also victim of family abuse.
Do not be a false witness
"MeToo WAS serious for women AND MEN, who can also be victims.

Unfortunately, it was exploited, distorted,  and cheapened."
"So happy for the win for ABUSED men. Hopefully men who don't have Johnny's kind of money, have the common sense to video the abuse for one,( I was on Amber's team till I heard Amber abusing Johnny) and don't give up, fight for what's right  I actually wish men and women would learn to RESPECT each other!!"
Can we pleAse start calling her the B lister instead of an actress. I had never heard of her before the televised court
$15 million - $2 million = $13 million
"""an actress called amber heard"" lol not even acknowledging she is a famous person lol b list if that.

i bet a few years down the track she will be on big brother or dancing with the stars lol"
"It should have been much higher than $15 mill, this is an actor that demands in excess of $20 mill per movie, and the damage to his reputation likely cost him several leading roles…"
10M compensatory + 5M punitive damages
"The lesson is, no one is untouchable and what you put out will come back at you 3 fold.
What goes around, comes back around.
JT-"
Hey Tucker how come you haven’t had Dinesh D’Souza on your show to review his movie 2000 mules?
LMMFAO🤣LMMFAO🤣I CAN'T HELP IT🤣🤣
MeToo got put in it's place.
Congrats to Jonny!  Can’t wait to see him movies again.
"Amber is pathetic! 
I love how Tucker tells the story. LOL LOL"
The lesson is that marriage is the primary cause for divorce.
What I realized from that trial is he had a substance abuse problem and she was physically abusive. They were both toxic as hell
In how many years will it be 'When was the last time anybody has heard of Amber Heard?'.
Johnny Depp should sue the Washington Post for 300 million dollars and 1 million alpacas!!!
I like how you allow the viewer to think for themselves. We need this.
*_She is only worth 2 million so how is she going to pat it..._*
"Me Too was very serious, and has been extraordinarily healing for many women who experienced sexual harassment and abuse. But you do you Carlson."
There really wasn't any winner here just goes to show having fame and all that money and they were both miserable
She lied under oath? No criminal charges?
Amber still got 2 million awarded to her. Even when a woman loses in court she wins...
Johnny Depp needs to Sue from Washington Post
"Score:
Divorced men- 1
Divorced women- 1,000,000
A crack in the victim scheme perhaps?"
Ever notice that Carlson sounds just like Mr Whipple for green acres. 😂😂😂
"Amen ,wish the courts would give the Americans lives back too."
I appreciate you letting people form there own opinion.
JD has saved the world 🌍
I’m glad Depp won but sick of this clown
I’m guessing this judgment will negate any future divorce settlement……
Never heard of heard until the trial.
My 💓 IS for JD!!
Expose the liars 👍
Technically she didnt write the op ed. She hired a ghost writer
These people are way way way overpaid. Think about it.
So can Depp sue them?
Technically 10 million in damages and 5 million in punitive but yeah
She did not accuse him she never mentioned his name.
He was going to win even if he was guilty
"Poor Johnny, dont hold your breath. She wont pay uou"
Who cares I know I dont
Money she will never pay
They should have also awarded the $7M to the charities that Heard promised to give but kept for herself
Me too is a what?? I've never met any woman or man for that matter who hasn't been molested or harassed by a man. Violence is a men's problem.
"Ms. Heard, your 😺pass has been by thine own hand, REVOKED!!"
Trying it on in a acting performance in a courtroom.
Beat me Amber beat me ..I need the money
"Amber is Ukraine, Depp is Russia"
You mean mentoo 💪
I don't care what Tucks thinks here.
"Why do the famous have so much money? Ups, it's gone😭"
J FJ.     (Justice for Johnny )
Nobody cares about Johnny Depp
"Listen to victims.
Believe facts."
"Drop deserves 5 years of salary compensation. Maybe more. So his highest earning potential, 20, 40, 50 million dollars a year times 5 years. Washington post and Amber heard should cough up 250 million"
A lesson learned that always not always me too some cases you lie
"AMBER is the typical woman in a ""quote"" abusive relationship.  😒.  Sorry to say it. Most of the time its the aggressive woman that starts. She was lucky Johnny was not the typical man in the situation and react in the manner she was hoping he would. Same reason Elon  dropped that nut jobless."
are they on court instead real criminals...real drama...and criminals stay free
If I was that judge I would have awarded Johnny Depp the money he asked for plus the money that she was asking for all to Johnny
She done what on his bed  😱
"10 mil 5 mil for punitive ..( the punished her with the punitive damage for lying to the court about Johnny and to the world.  Virginia capped that 5 mil at 350k..she is worth approx. 8 mil..sounds like she needs a movie ..but wait 
.who would ever hire her after this mess she created ..also came out in court that the execs at for the  Aquaman movie Didn't   care  for the lack chemistry A.H and Mamosa  did not have .  She was getting replaced and he said it on the stand  . Happy J.D. is vindicated ..she just needs to GO AWAY"
"Amber Turd (her name FOREVER now) is such a BAD actor... she couldn't convince ANYONE she was telling the truth.  Especially since she wasn't.  Her ""acting"" when she was talking about her dog... my gawd if anyone believed THAT... I have some ocean front property to sell them, in Arizona.  Just describing her as an actor... it an insult to every actor everywhere............................"
Believe ALL... Oh.😂
Amber Who?
"A total lie...
Pathetic!!!"
Justice was finally and completely served tho I think AH shd have won nothing. Pity the poor child she’s raising in the desert 😮
Dep the bully
Amber smollet
Nobody gives a crap about Johnny Depp
"Tucker, why won't you touch on the film 2000 mules?"
"She's remember me of my crazy-women one night stands...,over they 30 years they 👎👎👎"
johnny is representative of dv
F da post.....
Who cares?
If only we could all get justice for every leftists lies and defamations.
If he had a decent team of lawyers they would also be suing Disney
"There's nothing wrong with the metoo movement it ment well. 
Also Johnny wasn't 100 percent innocent either."
I just want to know why is everybody wanting to be in saleberties personal and private buisness. Or is this crapp just for ratings. Stupid if you ask me. Too much drama for me.

Brave woman to speak after so much of trauma
"please actually watch the full video before trying to argue that this trial has nothing to do with feminism, or that siding with Amber is un-feminist. I'm not going to reply to people who have clearly missed the point."
This was a very well thought out video! And it takes a lot of courage to put something like this out so kudos to you!
I came in believing amber heard but watching this trial had an opposite effect on me.... I believe johnny
where are closed captions? accessibility is a right
"I agree with you, both did some malicious stuff… Also, both men and women can be abusive, whether overtly or covertly sometimes its impossible to tell.


Example: an emotionally abusive husband who gets physically abused by the wife, who is the victim?
Flip the script.
Emotionally abusive wife get physically abused by the husband, who is the victim?


Without having actual stats I know men are mostly the perpetrators. But, I have seen women frame up their men because they know society they live in will support them without question. 

Literally in the society I live in, men who report abuse are dismissed for not being men enough…

So anytime a person cries wolf when there’s no wolf, it takes away from the progress we have achieved.

Also, abuse, especially non physical is soooooo complicated. 

All in all, I wish celebrity cases did not carry as much weight in influencing progress"
Excelente
I feel like I recall Twitter having this standard where they wont allow posts of allegations from unconfirmed sources...
"Reject the party of Hillary and immediately you get a ""me too"" accusation.  That's who the DNC has become. Yeah Elon, me too.  I will also be voting against them for the first time."
"Facts:

* Elon’s plane doesn’t crew a flight attendant.
* The “victim” hasn’t spoken.
* Elon is in the crosshairs of the establishment."
"I agree with robbie. No matter what happened, it was settled and there was no legality issues. It's none of our buisness. Period. Team blue is desperate."
"The democrat machine is sputtering, smoking, squealing, wobbling and I can't wait to watch it crash into the ditch and burn."
I think we're all used to the routine by now... media simply repeats their methods over and over like clockwork.
"*Was* it resolved? Did it happen at all? Was there an *it* to resolve? You're taking the word of the person whose word you're challenging, Robby. There's no reason to think at this point that *any* of it is true. We simply don't know. Good on ya for pointing out the hypocrisy of Tara Reade and Biden (though that wasn't allegedly settled -- she was discredited and had her career destroyed)."
"Wow, look at Ryan gaslighting like a pro"
The timing of this is amazing.
Her( friend) said that the flight attendant told her of the incident. Meaning obviously she wasn't there to see it or hear it directly as a witness. Isn't that called hearsay and groundless. Also if the woman was infact bought off in silence to not let it come out or file a complaint then now that it's out does she keep that money. Doesn't that forfeit the money. If there can't be a story coming from the direct source then it wouldn't be a probable event is think. So maybe Elon needs a hint from Johny Depp and defamation of character sounds like elons next move . 250 grand and it hits the news anyway . And he didn't even get a happy ending.
In the US for every influencial person there is dormant allegation awaiting to be activated just in case that person looks hostile to the establishment.Its sad.
"Any male with a heartbeat could have a female from his past come forward with “allegations” of misconduct.
How about just about every rock group from the past 50 years?"
It's funny how he basically predicted this would happen literally THE DAY before. Hilarious.
So happy this morning to see both of you at the helm.
"This is when Ryan hurts his credibility - somehow he is keen to believe 'a friend of a friend' and then tries to make this about a left versus right issue regarding electric cars. That's just absurd. Politics isn't a factor in buying a car. It just isn't. Trying to make that utterly ridiculous conclusion is just plain silly. C'mon, man. Ryan desperately wants to paint Musk as a villain and it's silly."
Not sure how Ryan reads minds and knows Musks tweet about voting Republican was to get in front of the business insider story
The fact that “team Blue/Left” is melting down over this whole thing is telling.
"A horse is not a gift, it's a burden. You ever taken care of a horse?"
Ryan comes back during the week and immediately reminds me of his inability to think rationally?  Exactly how were the allegations credible when neither party that was actually there is saying anything?
"Funny part is,  democrats were ok with keeping this hush hush, until he turned their back on him.. how revealing"
"I really should have put a bet on when Elon would be MeToo’d once he came out against the vindictive Democrats, but this was so fast I didn’t have time"
"""Anyone with sense"" could absolutely predict that the left would start playing dirty like this without any necessity of ""getting out in front"" of anything, Ryan."
"I like how Ryan is completely overlooking how the Left has started to boycott Telsa and delight in his stock price drop. So, even if the Right buys those fancy EV's Ryan dreams of, the Left will just shun them just in spite."
It's so weird how these me too allegations always fall out of the sky when you don't follow the lead of the Democrat regime.
1) Great to have Ryan and Robbie back at the same time. 2) I never thought of the possibility of people choosing to drive a Tesla over a pickup because ‘Murica. I love the concept.
How strange that he gets me too'ed after he tries to buy the echo chamber and he wants to vote red ...strange lol
Glad to see Ryan instead of Brianha.
"In a ""believe every woman"" atmosphere every allegation, no matter how suspect the timing or how tenuous the ""facts"", is credible by default."
I cannot drive an electric vehicle because I can't AFFORD it.
"I really appreciate the Hill's  objectivity of coverage 
Thank you"
"Ryan is back, so we can again know what CNN and MSNBC are thinking..."
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise
Whatever happened to Tara Reade??
"""I can't see him going through mediation and paying $250K if it didn't happen.""
Really?!? You're a news man, and this doesn't seem like a possiblity? It happens all the time, if it didn't ambulance chasing lawyers wouldn't be around.
And when you heard that he said he was voting Republican you know it has to be to get ahead of something else? Really? If you think that's the only reason, it says way more about you than him."
I could NEVER be famous. If I were ever famous I would be destroyed by the mistakes I have made in my youth. Let he who is perfect cast the first stone.
"Welcome back to Monday, Ryan."
"Thinking the ""Right"" is against electric vehicles is silly..."
It's weird how people like Ryan think. Just because you're a tribal kook doesn't mean everyone else is. Electric cars work for some people and not for others. And the people they work best for are those living in large cities with defined commuting distances with little to no cargo and plenty of charging stations. The rest of us have work to do with our vehicles.
"No one on the right is against owning electric vehicles. The problem is that electric vehicles don't fit the lifestyle. Hunting, camping, offroading, fishing, ranching farming. Gas is king cause it's storable. I know man conservative who have electric cars cause they good for in town chores. Also you can do propane conversion on many gas vehicles."
Ryan always has the dumbest takes on a story and seems to always contradict rational thinking.
"Meanwhile Flint still has terrible water and babies don’t have food they need, but oh no Musk was indecent 😱😱"
The swamp is deep and wide.
Agree 100% Robby!!!
@Ryan Grimm.  Welcome back to Monday!
"He was getting retaliated before he said that.  The apartheid story was first attempt.  You can argue, when business insider reach out to him, it made elon realize they are going to continue to after him.  They won't stop. So he said is voting  repub."
Ryan made some great points in this segment
"'Not for sale'

Takes payoff

👍"
"You know for all the talk about hate the""partisan divide"" in the country, it's amusing that Ryan so quickly jumped to "" Seems pretty credible"" in case of this scandal regarding Elon. Would he have done the same if it were say, Tom Hanks or Mark Zuckerberg."
"Sorry Ryan, as a conservative, Democrats have nothing to do with why I do not want an electric vehicle. 
And Musk buying Twitter does not make me think any different about EVs."
Ryan said Musks tweet was just trying to get ahead of the story. I think it was just an easy prediction to make.
Oh the me too’s. Here we go again. It should be on the list of things millionaires need to watch out for.
Ryan makes all the assumptions a progressive would make.
"Stopping at nothing, to stop him, they are."
Get rid of the democratic party and Ryan simple
Where were they before?
"Grimm: ""...doesn't sound out of character...""
Ryan, have you ever met Elon Musk? By what basis do you claim to know anything about his character?"
TEAM SOAVE
So you Know Elon Musk that well that you feel comfortable saying it is totally in his character to behave that way?? Interesting.....
"TLDR. If Elon offers you a horse for a happy ending, refuse and settle out of court. Ka-Ching?"
As credible as Hillary Clinton is credible.
For every victim there are 10 Amber Heards
Ryan elitists attitude really came through in this segment. Yes everyone just drop 60k for a new EV sure no problem Ryan
It's all completely  silly .  I just want my starlink. You have have Twitter  and Tesla
"No Ryan you assumed wrong!
That’s what happens when the democrats are desperate then attack with lies !
And that is exactly what happen and what actually happens to all of those batteries what they stop working?!"
"Men never be in the same room with a young woman with the door closed.  She can claim anything, and your lawyers will have to litigate you out of it.  Always have witnesses and even cameras to keep close tabs on them.  Too many women are looking for a quick payday to riches."
Its not about how it feels Ryan. Is it true or not? Period.
"Id love to believe ALL women...unfortunately,  I am incapable of defining a woman. Im not a biologist. Sorry"
"Yes, they got them back together and we got the ""odd couple"" thing going again. This is the dream team."
Sounds like every time I go the massage parlor except I only have part with 60 bucks.
The timing is way to sus
Ryan said it feels pretty credible yet we have been presented with no proof. Only he say she say. Has anybody even pulled up this alleged settlement agreement to see what it says or if it even exists? We really need to stop allowing people to run with this he say she say.
"What interesting timing that the instant he says he's gonna stop voting for democrats, we suddenly hear about this."
I didn't know Space X had flight attendants 🤷‍♂️
"*_JOKE JUSTICE_*
*What do you call a Billionaire* _arrested, convicted, & sent to Jail?_

1.  Nobody knows what really happened beyond her friend's version.  2.  There is no evidence that he retaliated against her.
"Twitter should do a memo like Netflix did. If you’re too delicate to work for a partisan company, maybe go work somewhere else"
Ryan is definitely a partisan hack! One thing I always appreciated from this show was the honest insight of all the reporters but Ryan was spinning like a top on this one
"I know it's probably out of your wheelhouse, but have you ever considered that most folks would have no problem driving an EV, but we all don't have 50 grand to throw down on one? You're assumptions and blanket comments really grind my gears..."
Ryan trying to make a point trying to beat a paper when he doesn't recognize he voted dem for years and now you can point a finger. Lol. The way America feels just like Elon.
I never knew that an airline tenant/masseuse could afford to keep a horse or was she a farmer?
No. Conservatives are not telling anyone they can't drive electric vehicles.
He says he'll vote republican to get ahead of a non story? C'mon Ryan
"@7:05 -- _""Retaliating when she says no? That doesn't seem out of character.""_ 

I wouldn't even frame it as retaliation... more like subconscious avoidance of an awkward situation. Remember, the ""retaliation"" took the form of her getting less work, so it makes sense if Elon was simply embarrassed. In the end, she got out with a nice $250k severance package, and everybody parted ways amicably. The fact that the only known incidence of such behavior happened so many years ago indicates to me that Elon learned a lesson about ""contextual appropriateness"" of flirtation and propositioning with someone who's on the company payroll."
"It’s ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS about timing with this BS. 
Which is truly tragic for those women with legitimate occurrences of this nature because it deepens the waters of disbelief."
"I was begging for Ryan to come back... and now I am not so sure. Are there any good Lefties that will argue in facts and good faith??? Smh, I'll take Destiny at this point. Atleast he's factual about somethings."
Ryan is such a tool.  He acts like republicans (conservatives) don't buy teslas.  do your homework.  It is almost evenly split.   Some people are interested in tesla's because of their horsepower ratings.
"Victim led justice causes much harm, it also clouds the truth where people are legitimately abused"
The district attorney's that bring forth these kind of case's need to be fired for wasting the courts time!
"Ryan's take that we are supporting Musk in order to ""own the libs"" is juvenile. I guess that concept is somehow comforting for him."
It was obvious they were going to try to metoo him.
These have become so oft used in an attempt to undercut the character of a person they have lost all credibility.
Elon for King! Flamethrowers in every home! 🔥🔥🔥
"Ryan thinks $250K means this was obviously serious?!  How much was he worth way back then?  
Ryan, you continue to be a clown."
"So, if you are a ""poor"" woman then you are automatically innocent and honest. If you are a rich man then you are automatically guilty and lying?"
Awe the media is so cute. They remind me of being 16 again
"They got rid if joy reid, their social engineering progressive optics, failed.

Keep it objective guys. That's why people watch it.
If I wanted joy reid, I'd watch msnbc"

"She is not wrong. I would have loved to have had anyone give me a wolf whistle when i was young lol but i was not pretty enough. I think the problem is that the definition of “abuse” has changed. Some things are true and terrible abuse but a wolf whistle or a guy putting his around round a woman, perhaps to comfort her, and then getting into trouble is a different matter. People love being victims for minor things which get blown out of all proportion and this takes away and denigrates REAL victims. Mental strength is something which is not promoted by today’s society and society as a whole is suffering as a result"
I'd never agree with her but she's right. Imagine even trying to flirt with a woman these days. You wouldn't fucking dare.
"I am the same generation as Joanna, i loved being wolf whistled.  If I had a pound for every time i got groped i would be rich, I just put them in their place and told them to clear off in no uncertain terms.Some women even if a man calls them darling would see it as sexual abuse.  Back in the day we would say a bloke was trying it on, just to find out what sort of girl you were.  Its ironic really that  we are now living in an age when women jump into bed with someone and live with someone and have children out of wedlock a lot more than we did and yet a wold whistle becomes sexual abuse"
Good for you Joanna  👍
She’s absolutely right.
And Daisy epitomises everything that's wrong in this modern world.  Joanna's totally correct in what she said.
Joanna 100% correct.
"If you are so passionate about this Daisy where was your vocal support for the 25k + underage white girls raped by a certain community in the uk? It is the biggest story of racism, pedophilia and rape ever by a community we can recognise and deal with but i dont think i heard your views on it at all?? You seem worried about a wolf whistle , crude comment (can be made by both sexes) but not rape? The day you come out and tell us your views on the grooming gang scandal is the day you will have any credibility on this movement, until then why would we listen to a woman with no backbone too scared to call out rape and racism when they see it"
"Maybe we should have a me too movement for all the men who got divorce shafted, had their kids taken off them and were rinsed financially? Are we going to just let women behave however they want to?"
Lumely is so right 👏👏👏 it’s not right that it’s done to you but we dealt with it and just went on. Sexual abuse is different
Sounds to me like Daisy is more of a Pansy. She's the kind of woah-man who would complain if a man held a door open for her screaming it was mansplaining
Lumley is correct.
"For heaven's sake. Leave Joanna alone. She is telling women not to let bad things consume you, you have to carry on living your life."
Joanna was referring to an era when our mothers taught us to be fearless and defend ourselves against the creeps.If someone steps over the line with you stand up to them .  Basically strength of character is something that isn't cultivated anymore.
Talk tv is going very woke Joanna correct 💯👏👏👏
"I agree with Joanna,people are weak and pathetic now,they can't cope with anything."
My mum is 74 and she says the same it was a complement when you were whistled at its just ugly girls who are offended because they never get any attention
Stop twisting what Joanna said. And you are so flipping precious Daisy.
Daisy? The Name Fits You Perfectly.
Daisy's all of a sudden becomes Mrs Durrells
"Joanne is totally right I have known sexuall advances from women ....no problem with that ...women love to be a victim of something these days , all buttoned up and waiting for it to happen ."
Shes not saying woman should just put up with it and men do what they want. She saying stop trying to be a victim
"Well said Joanna, absolutely correct."
A quick scan of this comment section reveals to me that Daisy does not understand TalkTV's audience. Perhaps she would have a better career as Shelagh Fogarty's sidekick?
"Saying someone is backward is offensive nowadays (in London anyway) and she's said that on TV??? She's also Glib (offensive!) Is that forward thinking or backward thinking on daisy's behalf??? Lumley is allowed an opinion and I'm glad about that! 
You can't be offended by what someone said and then offend yourself."
I'm with Joanna on this issue. A knee in the 'b*****s' usually sorts out pathetic blokes who try it on.
Not often I disagree with fabulous Daisy but I'm with Joanna !
"Good for Joanna, she’s absolutely right."
"Just look at the comments on here Daisy, I can hardly find anyone who supports your point of view. Kevin was right when he said that it's now fashionable to be a victim, as a man you are constantly wondering if you have said the right thing in case someone takes offence, it's madness."
Joanna is right; too many professional 'victims'.
Typical woke tactic - misquote somebody who isn't there and then attack them for something they didn't say.
"Not saying it,s right but Women get drunk and grope men as well, but men are expected to just laugh it off, take it with a pinch of salt as a flirty compliment etc."
"Joanna did not say it's OK for men to behave badly. 
Get it right if your going to speak about her opinions. 
Well said Joanna."
She's right I'm afraid some women love being a victim if a man gropes you smack him.
Daisy McAndrew Not many agree with You !
Joanna 99% on target.
You are completely twisting her words 😮
It's her opinion and she's entitled to it.
"Neither of them “like” or “really like” Joanna Lumley, they are just looking to jump on the bandwagon of criticising whatever they think is the current fashion to criticise🙄🙄"
"Love Joanna, real women and I got to say if a bloke sad as he may be wants to ""touch"" a women, imagine the  affect of being slapped in the face, especially in public I doubt they do it again. Please see the word ""touch"" anything over and above is different."
"Notice how Daisy immediately misrepresents what Lumley said. Lumley never said women should let men behave as badly as they want. She said if a man tried to grope her she would slap him. Then the other woman starts talking about Harvey Weinstein. At what point did Lumley ever defend the actions of Weinstein?

This type of misrepresentation is exactly what is wrong with debate today."
"The lady with brown hair, she got the message right…it’s about abusive power and how it’s imbalance of power. It’s applies to racism card, where it’s over used."
I agree with Joanna she is right. Women think they are victims all the time. That's all she was saying.
Bet she wouldn't say that in front of Dame Joanna
"AND SHE IS RIGHT
AND A REAL WOMAN"
"A paramedic claimed sexual assault after a man patted her bum, that's ridiculous."
"Well said Joanna! She ain’t condoning sexual assault, but she is right, women and men were stronger, more resilient and just got on with life. I am sick of the barrage of alleged sexism, racism and every other ism. Stop whingeing."
"Why dont they ever have a discussion about how for all their talk ,The comments  dont back up their arguments ."
I do quite like Kevin O’Sullivan
What she forgets is not every woman felt empowered to slap the man back.
relationship's are no fun these days and way to much hassle i don't bother anymore am sure am not alone
How do you distinguish the people telling the truth from the attention seekers. It does feel like everyone is complaining and sometimes without a cause.
Joanna is correct in this.
Predictable rhetoric from Daisy
"YOU MY DEAR ARE THE ‘ BACKWARD ONE’
You all play ut fir what its worth"
This is the first I hear from Joanna Lumely and that little bit indicates her to be a fool defending unacceptable behavior.
"Joanna I’d right! You don’t have to slap them, a kick in the balls is far more humiliating!"
Both sides can be true.
Daisy McAndrew your the problem we have to day WOKE
Bravo Joanna Lumley
"A woman at a recent family gathering asked me if I'd go and talk to a female in a pub, if I liked the look of her. I replied, 'Nope! No chance. Not nowadays...'"
Im with Joanna personally. Women who get wolf whistled (if they dont like it) SHOULD give the guy the finger. A guy who gropes a women SHOULD get given a slap by her. But instead they run home and tweet about their trauma.
"Why do they always go to such an extreme case, such as Harvey weinstein scandal, when you know fine well what  Joanna was referring to is in general. As a woman, I'm disgusted with how the media divides between genders, pitting us up against one another all the time."
"Lumely is correct. And why not do both? Discourage lecherous behaviour but also encourage a toughness in women that isn't at the expense of their own agency, these panellists are idiots. There is value in victimhood as has been proven time & time again."
"Are we just talking about biological women here (whatever they are) or does it also include biological men who identify as 'women"""
A real woman knows how to deal with a bloke …
"Wrong is wrong, doesn't matter what era or who says it"
Bravo joanna
This show is the woke wing of talk TV...lol
"I didn’t take this in anyway that JL was having a go at people who are genuinely the ‘victim’ of something horrible, it’s quite the opposite ! She’s having a go at people who are claiming to be ‘victims’ who simply are not and it’s those people who do more damage to those in need. I’m sure I’m not the only one to feel this way but nowadays, I hear so much whining and complaining and attention seeking, that I’ve sort of switched off to my fellow human beings ! I don’t really care about everyone else’s made up problems."
"I spent my late teens and twenties from 1979 all through the 80s working in a building full of older men, some younger men being just as bad, and when I think back what I put up with was not acceptable, and I ain’t talking about wolf whistles or door holding here. I did what Joanna Lumley said and just brushed them off, which I shouldn’t have ever had to do, they should have been educated enough to keep their filthy hands and remarks to themselves."
"Just to confirm
Groping is indecent assault.
Reporting it means loss of jobs .
Being branded a trouble maker. 
Phone calls Being made to future employers. 
Men stick together."
What about women toughen up which will give them control of themselves.  Which is really all we can control!
Is she wrong though?
I so agree with you Daisey .
Azarika is everywhere with her predictable wokeist views on everyone and everything.
She’s right women used to be tougher women play the victim all the time now and people forget about the women in this country used that went through 2 world wars and worked and brought up children she does not just mean harassing she also means the toughness of being a women a women used to run a family and work look after the kids my great grandmother went through 2 world wars in this country they live on tinned food and had a radio in the air rade shelters she was a manageress in a restaurant and had 3 kids my grandfather was a black cab driver here women have become weak we were once tough breed in this country like the queens generation
"I’m a drop dead gorgeous bloke with his own Caravan, regularly get women trying to slip hands down my y-fronts, I can get wearing, eventually."
I've been wolf whisled and had my arse slapped by groups of women worse bit is I'm pretty sure they were sarcastic with it.
Good balanced debate
Daisy … has anyone ever wolf whistled you?
Sorry but when women complain about a wolf whistle then appear half naked dancing on social media..... Double standards
Joanna is right
Well said kevin

Joanna is correct
Because the perpetrators are the victims

Love my nation🇮🇳 and as human being I support Sophie and all those who fight for equality and I will pray for her...."
"3:32朱军是被诬陷的，弦子是中国版amber罢了

"First and foremost, I do not deny the atrocities, both old and new, that Canada and our neighbouring country, the US, are also engaging in/complicit to. With that said, countries as like China and Russia are hosts to governments which harm their citizens when their citizens are raising what can best be labelled as legitimate concerns about their diminishing well-being, safety, and freedoms. A country's ability to raise a fair portion of its populace out from poverty while at the same time dismantling rights, freedoms, and autonomy, just to name a few, is totalitarianism/tyranny draped with the illusion of compassion. A gentle closing note: Had I been without access to food nor to a means to eke out a living, I do not know how I would regard tyranny. As an outsider, I can only call out tyranny and hope that people will find the will and resources to make the changes they may need."
Thank you for reporting on this BBC! I only wish leaders were as willing as private companies

there are a very few people who really take risk their life to speak out the truth are punished if being caught.

"Did she really just vanished? Like Julian Assange, he vanished too...and was found in UK prison. UK is trying to silence that poor guy. In UK, its OK to silence that guy, put him in jail and deny him his rights to freedom of speech. I am sure If Assange is in China we would have demanded for his released. The irony is that we are extremely and deeply concerned with this Sophia in China yet put Julian locked up in our prison and deny him the freedom we all so dearly have."

"""The Chinese government has the right idea."" Sargon of AKKKad. (probably)"
Feminism has been THOROUGHLY DISPROVEN ALREADY
who would rap this wgly tink
"1. After some digging, apparently Huang xueqin was arrested with the other guy because they participated in the Hong Kong protest. The two occasions where they were arrested happened after the said event and the charges weren’t about her feminism movements, it’s because she protested in Hong Kong. “The criminal attempt to overthrow the national government” stated by the official documents. 

And I am certain that the internet comments she received were related to the protest instead of feminism, but if there is one thing that the BBC is good at, it’s twisting words. 

2. The feminism movement is pretty hot in China. A controversial topic no less, as it has always been, but never illegal. The cringe like feminist comedians do exist and they receive massive monetisation through TV programs and advertisements. And they were never cancelled and threatened despite receiving massive hate on the internet. 

So basically BBC took a journalist arrested by CCP for protesting, who happened to advocate feminism, and put it into a report that a journalist was arrested for supporting feminism in China. 

As bad as China may be, this is clear manipulation on BBCs end. This is not journalism, it is simply another continuation of an existing narrative, and a cheap and lazy attempt to grab headlines based on some perceived political correctness. This is why nobody trusts mainstream media anymore."

"Shame on BBC, it is so BIAS!!! Shall we make a self-criticism for ME TOO after Johnny and Amber's case? This lady was not arrested for woman's rights, she was involved with  Hong Kong Independence. On second thought, it is a common sense that anyone with an international background who knows the woman's rights in China nowadays is more advanced than Korean and Japanese. We might judge the undemocratic part of China, but pls, get out of your office and do your research. What I can see from this video is ideology first, and full of BBC's ignorance and prejudice"
