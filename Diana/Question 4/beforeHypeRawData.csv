Don't apologize to these witches. You stand your ground. He was absolutely correct. He didn't hurt a soul.
"Sounds like Tony meant what he said, but apologized to cover his ASS. He was being an adult BULLY to that woman who had the courage to SPEAK UP to him."
"Exposing a perpetrator empowers one, that takes courage, helps protect others and is down right heroic. Remaining silent, that‚Äôs a right...because of fear, because of PTSD, and other issues."
men are losing their careers without due process. just because she says it where is the evidence.
He was right this is why causes become cultish
Stand your ground Tony. You were correct. Don't back down to these movements.
Damn I am a girl. I am so disrespected!

"Rapist will come out and try to defend themselves and their fellow brotheren with many reasons but it only make them look guilty, like that show when they caught them with cameras trying to pick up kids for sex.   Compare his demeanor to one of those rapist who think they can get away with  rape, murder etc 

I see a rapist"
Tony is a bad man

Tony Was right. Stop crying
men are losing their careers without due process. just because she says it where is the evidence.
"Why they are not showing Aditi Mittal face? She was accused for sexual harassment, Ya women can also sexually harass another women or man."
"Ms Flora Saini, I applaud you for your righteous courage and honesty to lodge the police complain...back then there was no such moement....love you sister. Regards and respect.
Aum Shanti"
"@Arnab how about Jasleen Kaur and Sarabjeet's case. Your previous channel made him a criminal. So, are you not equally responsible. And in your words, ""The impact of an unsubstantiated allegation."""
"The accusation on Chetan Bhagat showing the chat history is ridiculous.. Comeon, the normal flirtation which happens on chat should not be considered ME TOO.. üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èIn this way, the many many stories of real Victims will lose momentum and seriousness..."
"ONE ""FALSE ALLEGATION"" CAN RUIN LIFE OF NOT ONLY THAT PERSON BUT ALSO RUINS LIFE OF ENTIRE FAMILY OF THAT ""FALSELY ALLEGED PERSON"".
ALL THOSE PERSON SHOULD BE PUNISHED ""VERY VERY BADLY"" WHO IS DOING ""FALSE ALLEGATION"". ""DEFAMATION LAWS"" SHOULD BE VERY VERY STRONG."
I am myself a woman but i protest again this...
This movement was started to exposing predators but many innocent men also were dragged
"It's really shocking about AJ Akbar but still more shocking is the way a journalist explained her harassment during her first interview, finally I became speechless when I came to know that she literally accepted the job offer from the so called predator Akbar  and worked there for several yearsüò±üò±üò±
AUB KYA BOLNAA DOSTO????üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞"
if social media can be blatantly used for seeking personel vendetta then one can imagine how more than 50 women centric laws can have been misused since decades untill n unless strong misuse laws included in these laws this debate will go on for years
"Dear sir,
I am proud to be a Pakistani. I love my country and the culture we are living in. we respect each other and elder as well. we respect the women as well. but now a days there is a movement with name Me Too. which falsely alleged the respected persons without any proof. if any one is victim she/he should sue in court. This alleged should be considered 
Extortion court  
and should be stopped immediately otherwise we will see the amazing disorder in our society and will never be able to stop to disgrace celebrities, politician, heroes etc. which will definately effect the performance of heroes of society. 

if any one has any kind of problem he/she should immediately knock on the door of court. 
i am an ordinary pakistani living in saudi arabia. and hope that your majesty will take a strong action against me too movement and enacting the law to stop the allegations in media. 

thanks 
Regards 
Atif"
Deepika Bharadwaj is the only sane voice on this panel
Deepika the lady with spects makes sense
"Don't Beleive men or women, Beleive only in Evidence. absolutely correct üëå"
"One potential outcome of this movement would be that ppl will be shit scared to become friends with opposite genders, be it at college, work or any industry. So better follow traditional values, don't unnecessarily talk or mingle with boy or girl. Be safe, single and happy."
"It's really unfair when such top level victims say i don't believe in the legal system,  Arnab you don't think this will convey  the horrible  message to middle class women. I am with  Me too movement but i am not convinced by their argument. One line i would like to say women should expose who are involve in such charge but if you don't follow the legal system, people will doubt. So don't stop. Go ahead india is with you, if you are right."
"Having 12 people shouting over each other on a news channel is just ridiculous. This is not a debate, this is chutiyapa !"
The time taken by the female celebrities of accusing men of sexual harassment is too long. What happens if the men so accused is no more and none to defend him.
deepika mam speak truth.
So sad for you Flora. Stay strong!
"Look at these greedy bootlickers , 1 advertisement every minute üò°üò°üò°"
Arnab love the way u command on the politicians and ur language is wawww....... Keep going gud luck
"Items number are most popular in India, we all love them specially the one performed by Sunny."
"This is a serious and paramount problem, NOT ONLY in the GREAT BHARAT MAATA,  but all OVER the world. Here, in USA,  Europe, IN the Churches as well as regular WORK places.  I Highly commend Arnav Swami for bringing UP the problems. in INDIA.  THIS is THE start of a SOCIETY evolving TO maturity and greatness.  JAI BHARAT MAATA."
"Most of these charges are trumped up. Why something alleged to have taken place so long ago is being splashed now. Obviously, such complainants want publicity and also settle scores with men with whom they were unhappy over some issues."
Whats the use of debate if there is no conclusion......
"Arnob, Tanushree daring n honest recount  is praiseworthy  ...IEA sec 6,7,8,9 read together a strong case in her favor n Nana can't  escape... Regards"
There should be a law passed against punishment of false allegations .
By metoo campaign there will be Highest selling magazine is  India today.
When someone comes forward and accuses  a well none actor. don't  you think his reputation has gone down the drain and has been given the guilty tag
ME TOO movement is not only for women but for everyone including men and children.. Please everyone should SPEAK OUT üòéüòéüáÆüá≥
the biggest achievement in metoo is deepika pionted put we knw the accused but dnt knw the accuser wow what to say on this
Deepika rocks
Seems Arnab loosing his argument and strength of his voice too
"The genuine ""ME TOO"" movement should not be neglected only because of few people who are not genuine... But, men should be given equal chance to counter react to the allegations... But, the fact is proportion of genuine victims of abuse are far more outnumbered than others... üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üëçüëç"
Epic joke of Me too is mahesh bhatt and his daughter taking credit of bashing predators üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ
It's so good that we have a woman like deepika that's speak facts
Ladies we back u.. You have a valid point.. & we are proud of you all
"So many females harrassed came out after so many years...all of them claiming the did filed the complaint and neither police took any action nor anything in AIR or in news media......
These innocent ladies making a fool of a people"
Why do i do this to myself...why do i watch arnab...why!
"So all these girls or women since last decade or more were waiting for Me too campaign to be launched in India to reveal their harassment hahaha...
Modi k aate hi sabko himmat AA gyi hahaha"
Deepika is a great woman.. Seriously
Arnab wants to go both ways. Victims should avoid Republic until Arnab proves his agenda. Calling people like Rahul Eeshwar & Mukesh Tyagi doesn‚Äôt make sense.
Why are the victims of ‚ÄòMe too‚Äô movement not registering cases against their ‚Äòsexual predators‚Äô? I guess these victims doubt their own case or are too engrossed in fabrications and exaggerations. Men who mistreat women deserve stringent punishment.
"It shouldnt be Men vs Women. It should be the Real vs Fake. It should be Sincerity vs Hypocrisy.
The real victims should be given justice and the real perpetrators need to be exposed and punished."
Media is the highest supreme Court in Indian so social media will be give justice to those complainer .
Now this chashmis debates on right track ...... Tanushree also did wrong allegations
Already so many women centric laws.
No body wants legal probm
"If our legal court system was quick and gives reasonable platform for all of the citizens/victims without the fear or scare of powerful and influential people who will harass you more after you come out and SPEAK OUT, üòé üòé üáÆüá≥ üáÆüá≥this ME TOO movement would not have STARTED IN THE FIRST PLACE üëçüëç"
It was the prevailing culture!  Sexual favors were being extended by ambitious women.  Most walked away!
"It's so hard for the people to get justice in india. ‚òÖ
It's simply astounding how long it takes to get judiciary to pass a verdict. 
‚òÖ This is the reason why the Social Media is only option left for people to get some justice. 

Minister of Law must look into this and find a way to get around this.

Bande Mataram ‚òÖ"
"Metoo was started by nuns ,but where are those nuns ?"
Republic Court and Judno Arnab will give the verdict
Wow... Arnab is playing a nasty game here... God bless India
"If anything happens, report it immediately. They will do whatever they like, Shameless"
"Its actually happens both side,, its not one sided issue o have seen that in India even women uses  her body to get success, many Men suffers for it too,, and many time even if women get fired or forced to perform right she use Women Card,, Its both the side ,,  Its not Only Men, Women also knows how to USE Seduction Power of her,,,  this is ridiculous 

Supreme Court Judgment Against  Men about After Marriage Affair,,  damm  Who Will Support Women if there is threat of miss using  Law"
101% agree with Rizwan.
Whether this can not be the congrees to malign the image of those who support or supported BJP? I think that no one has said about Mahesh bhutt or others those support congrees.
"shame on u Me -too , u people took harassment as piece of cake just to pursue ur career, I salute those burka claad uneducated women who knocked the SC door, fighted against all odds to get justice, being educated with sound social economic background u people kept career above ur own dignity and honour, compromised with the situation but now making foul cries. I am not supporting any culprits, no offense but the way these victims accepted job and continued it for years under the  predator's leadership is disgusting."
it's like people are arguing in a market .......
Arnab it will be nice if you tell your panel to talk one at a time. It is really difficult to hear anything when are all are shouting. Still can‚Äôt understand why they have to shout. Your show will be so much better. Glad you are discussing this subject. It needs to be spoken about. Thanks.
And u took sides without investigation..... What kind of investigative journalist are you?? üòÇüòÖ
"I won't be surprised if ministers,police,army and corporate and government sector bureaucrats will come out in this. No surprise at all. Punish them all."
not very resolving.very chaotic
Will arnab ever take firm stand in his debate? Keeps jumping here an there in entire show... Such a double faced person
India is a feminist country hence me too is fundamental right of women
dipika is on point
when our chief justice just not believe in legal system then how can I ..... i am talking about Ranjan Gogoi....
Because this is India... Everybody here is bol bachan with out any action.
"As for i see # Me Too is great thing happened. 
Legal system takes its own time, meanwhile victim  have platform to Name and Shame (nanga karna) to perpetrator."
"""BACKGROND CHECK"" IS THE TOOL WHICH CAN     S T O P     MANY CRIMES."
Why mukesh Tyagi ??
Plzz file fir
Arnab: NEHRU IS RESPONSIBLE FOR sexual harassment
"Arnab ji even in silent movie era no parents used to allow their daughters to join films , Raj kapoor  used to introduce  debutant female only if the actress  accepts to his conditions of exposure .casting couch the primary requisite , gladly accepted purely not to struggle too hard ."
"Especially @1:09:53 the comment made by Gunja to Deepika because Deepika supported investigation sounds very bad. She's been gender biased saying the statement ""being a women"" and again in the end she's asking Deepika not to be gender biased. How stupid is that!!"
Mera ko to ya publicity stunt jada lagta ha
There is no thing as a free ticket!! There is always a price to pay... sadly
Hi
Me Too Campaign-what is happening here in our society???üòîüòîüòî
Lot of SJW
"Sexual predators have no gender..  Me-too movement should not be gender blind. Alternate sex and men should also come out and put out their violators, notify them. Society can be saved of such evils and demons when the attack is 360 degree and no one regardless of class,  gender,  profession or hierarchy be spared of such crimes.."
oh my ghhhuuuuuuuuuuuoood
"After decades they are expressing their sagas , since decades prestigious parents were well aware of the aspirations of the cinema fraternity and they had  bad views from then on .Me Too campaign and demanding investigation looks more political than social ."
"MeToo movement that is doing rounds in media has come as a blessing for Narendra Modi. Modi was getting flayed because of his inability to control fuel price. He was mired in RAfale scam where he was trying to benefit his old friend Anil Ambani. 
This frivolous movement has masked inefficiencies of NArendra Modi."
"Heloo Arnab Ji, please call for and speak supportively with Chinmayi from south india. he is also a victim of male harassment.  she is not supported neither by tamil media nor tamil ppl !!"
"WE ALL THE PEOPLE SHOULD ASK ""SUPREME COURT OF INDIA"" TO PASS THE LAW TO      S T O P     ALL THE ""SOCIAL VICES (PROSTITUTION, HUMAN TRAFFICKING, DRUGS, DRINKING, GAMBLING, SMOKING, TOBACCO, & MANY MORE)""."
"Film industry has casting couch culture , all the top heroines go through that"
we need more women like deepika who actually understands the gravity
"As M J Akbar is named , now Arnab doesn't support mee too... Hahahaha.."
"The only case which has been proven is of Aditti mittal raping kaneez surwa on stage in front of the audience, but we dont see that here"
If this is the stand of these women then No private employer will ever employ any women and this is going to harm the women in large.......Beacuse of the approach of these womens the genuine women who is harrased will suffer........ARNAB BHAI KYA CHAL RAHA HAI...............
Me to ? Tomorrow
arnab is brilliant
One is murdered ... police court does not do any thing .. so no need to go to them ... settle it on TV
Avijit should shut up now. He made a lot of damage to himself by taking too much.
Arnab is clearly playing here. First he heard every story about sexual harrasment and now he is taking those women to file an FIR by raising questions against them. He is not double face. He really want those victim's to be legally punished and not to get away with just media trail.
This is Joke....Utter foolish drama...Why are these jokers on twitters rather than filing complaints....This is utter nonsense.
being a women u dont support women if she is right or wrongthis the most nonsense comment i have ever heard or rather gender baised mindset so being a man should i support rapist absolutely no i would rather demand to hang him by court be rational
"Arnab shouted so much reg. Mr. Bachchan, salman, amir not speaking on tanushri issue but did not say anything about Smriti Irani, Sushma Swaraj refusing to say anything on the issue. He has not the quality of a good reporter. Always becomes obsessive."
Now media will spoil the career of Emraan Hashmi by showing this repeatedly so that after big directors will not take him in their films.This bulshit media did the same thing with Sushant singh rajput
First thing is why all as harashment..?..better not to consider all as harashment...who are these bloody nonsense to make new new things in atmosphere..totally against it is...better need to change script that everything is not harashment...in the name of harashment spoiling and doing nonsense in atmosphere..you people are nonsense there..
MGTOW
Worst and nonsense among genders it is...
"I'd be very interested to hear June's view had it been a male protester being stopped by a female MP in the same way, total feminism running wild right now."
i like how in one breath she goes on about female empowerment and then in another she says we need to protect women. Which one is it?
He could have ragged her round like a doll but he never he grab and escorted her out the opposite of violent
June.....Oh dear oh dear!
"Does anyone know that why there is NO ""Sexual Harassment"" in small cities in the Middle Eastern countries?"
"If a female burglar broke into my house holding a crowbar, I am not allowed to defend myself."
What an astonishingly bad take by june
"I wondered whether she has ever manhandled a man?


This sort of show is part of the reason why clowns like D. Trump won. Political correctness, gone wildly wild"
"Pandemic? Really
 Oh come on! Ffs"
"Mark Field should get promotion and a medal, not suspended."
If it was an instinct for violence how come she wasn‚Äôt hurt in any way???????
clips of a white screen followed by detailed debate; I cannot follow this
No Afua that was reasonable force!
"First and foremost, the supposed _SECURITY_ that were there should be publicly ridiculed for allowing this person to get as far as they did!"
"I am stunned by the niavety of these supposedly intelligent women. Their arguments are based on ""after the fact knowledge and information of who and what these protesters were"". They then base their arguments and hurt feelings based on this, refusing to acknowledge that there could have been a more sinister motive given the situation. ""Well it it was Greenpeace, we know that because they told us at the time."" To say they would have let an unknown female protester walk past them to confront two of the most senior and important people in the country and wait to see what happened truly is astonishing and reflects the type of society we live in. I have seen and experienced sudden violence both towards other people and to myself, at times committed suddenly by supposedly reasonable and calm people. I have no party political allegence  to any one and do not know this man. He did the right thing. It was not unreasonable to form an opinion that this woman meant to do or could do harm, that maybe she was not who she said she was. Maybe those at the head of Greenpeace should reflect over their own actions that put at least one person in a private meeting in fear of possible violence and putting a woman at risk of violent reaction."
Normal people will agree that Mark Field did the right thing. Only a feminist would not agree.
B.S... Welcome to equality.
"So... If someone robs your house, just accept it if its a women?"
So with their logic is it OK for me to kill a man if he approaches me and my private space?
How biased and unprofessional is the lady in the middle. Violence against women is disgusting but at least here out other sides. Don‚Äôt just make up your mind that your way is the only way.
"Oh, now taking precautions is conflated with a ‚Äútoxic‚Äù backlash."
Not what I saw. I saw a man stand up and defuse a potentially dangerous situation. Were security on holiday? Once the person breaches a private function they become a threat.
Why is no one mentioning the elephant in the room in that she was smiling throughout meaning she clearly was not in any discomfort at all.
If that was a man he would have been rugby tackled to the floor in an instant.
Fields shouldn‚Äôt apologise
"The video of him is blank, it is just a white screen while we hear what is going on."
The protester had no business entering a private party. I would have handled her the same way.
As a society we do not care about women ???? Society was and is  still being built around caring and protecting  for women.
June and Afua... Public enemies no.1 regardless of what topics they discuss üòÖü§î
These 2 black women would have had a field day if the protester had been black. The one with the pony tail takes every opportunity to play the race card on this show.
He removed an intruder using reasonable force. How is this even news? Left wingers are mentally ill
"When the smart and beautiful demand the punishment of a violent authoritarian pig, it obviuosly raises the ire of all the other pigs."
JUNE WANTS TO LOOK WHITE SO BADLY.
She shouldnt of been in the room ..........
And what if that woman was about to punch the guy
She also believes if a woman uses a weapon against her spouse and hospitalizes him he should be punished further.
Afua and June.......well that's enough youtube for today üòØ
no video no proof
Women complain they are not treated equally .. women complain they are treated they same way any man would have been in the same situation.
If my daughter was man handled by someone in this way protesting in a place where she‚Äôs not wanted I‚Äôd tell her not to be so bloody stupid.
June and aufa got some good old victimhood to get their teeth into üòÇ haha she was horrified haha the woman was smiling when he took her out . They give more fooks than the women does
"I come from a country where I have seen a lot of violence. Living in the UK, I was astonished at the action of the MP. Anyone justifying his action should ask themselves reflectively if it would have been alright for their wife, girlfriend, mother or sister to be manhandled that way. The lady posed no threat given her demeanor and the fact that her two hands were occupied by non dangerous objects. The quality of response by most members of the panel is a reflection of the very low quality of the individuals we have allowed to shape public opinion in this country of ours. It is shameful and disgraceful . If this MP whose action shows that he views women(probably including those in his personal life) as lesser beings has any self respect left, he should remove himself from the public space and go get some help."
What the hell was that opening monologue...
This anchor just makes me pissed...
""" speaking truth to power "" .............HER TRUTH. Not everyone else's"
MGTOW
I couldn't see any video of the attack other than a complete white screen.  Has this been censored?
"Oh I do love Greg, what a complete  treasure :)"
"On Brazil a group of female protesters got beaten by police for doing much less, and the public opinion treated them (the protesters) like criminals hahahaha. At least we didnt lose our commom sense down here ."
"Perhaps the woman might have been a nut with a knife?
I guess the guy didn't have time to play pc politics and decide whether this was an attempted assault on someone or not.
Just imagine if our police had to box-tick a form before deciding whether to intervene in a similar situation.
The man did right.
What I want to know is how they got past security in the first place?"
cancer!!!
What a joke
Everyone join in the victim circle.
One cannot do such a thing in a private company let alone someone in the public sector. This was physical abuse and his reaction brings to question what kind of person he is in private life. His political career should be over and the conservative party should be ashamed for those applause. Great topic in the face of the me too movement.
"June Sarpong  is hot üî•üî•üî• af but dead wrong and shamefully so. Men have a ""instinct for violence"" (or protection as I would but it) as Afua said. That instinct is more prominent in some men to act when there is a threat of danger. Now to a onlooker it may look sinister but in the moment he had no idea who this person was. And even if everyone else in the room read the situation differently and didn't see a threat- HE DID. He saw people entering unlawfully and he acted as per how he felt was appropriate. 


June makes a massive jump in assuming it was because she was a woman that he acted violently.  Nope I didn;t see that. Two people can see the same video and see different things. This depends on our life experiences and perspectives. As a man I saw what Ive seen in myself many times. An instinctive protective reaction for those around me to act when I perceive a threat. 


Now the icing on the cake is June doenst even accept his apology. Shameful. really shameful. This is why men are turning against feminists. because they don't even accept out apologies when we give them and admit a wrong. Shame on June Sarpong!"
That aggressive behaviour is very misogynistic. He proper lashed out on her.
"June is really gorgeous, just sayin"
All ways the same with them 2
Black woman in the beginning g is hilarious. Is she doing stand up?
"Well if protests are not received fairly, we wont protest anymore... we will go where our protest is appreciated    STOMP"
"That black woman is right. 
Mark Field should be disciplined better..."
Afua is smart and beautiful...the star of this program..her views are almost always on point
"it was racist, if she was wearing a white dress they would have let her pass"
MGTOW
"Je suis un HOMME. J'ais vu des jeune filles se faire harceler trois fois par des jeunes HOMMES. Ils passaient en voiture en disant qu'elles √©taient bonnes. Une autre fois, dans le tramway, heureusement elles ne se sont pas laiss√©es faire.... Je me demande si ces jeunes ont fait leurs √©ducations sexuel en regardant des films pornographiques tr√®s tr√®s jeunes avec leurs portables pay√©s par leurs parents?   Les relations entre filles et gar√ßons se sont d√©grad√©s..... Dans ma jeunesse on avait un  meilleure rapport avec les filles.   On avait encore notre innocence √† 15/16 ans....On prenait notre temps pour se conna√Ætre.....Les jeux de s√©duction √©taient maladroit, on √©tait un peux gauche, mais on ne franchait pas les limites....On s'envoyait des petits mots ou un entremetteur rapportait les lettres ou les petits mots d'amour.   En fait la drague se faisait dans la douceur.....J'esp√®re que √ßa existe toujours....Les filles deviennent un peux moins f√©minines qu'√† mon √©poque. Je pense que c'est aussi une fa√ßon de se prot√©ger.....C'est triste."
Heureusement qu'elles sont toujours flinguer pas de grosse perte pour nous ahahaha
"A man and a woman having an intelligent discussion on modern problems, there's still hope for humanity!"
"Two minutes in, and I could see this woman was going to have an INTELLIGENT conversation instead of ""gotcha""."
So refreshing to see ‚ÄúJordan Peterson on me too‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúJordan Peterson DESTROYS me too‚Äù
It‚Äôs sad that all the comments are praising her for being reasonable because we‚Äôve gotten so used to unreasonable behaviour and steering conversation away from reality
Respect to this lady for actually listening to him and asking him what certain things mean. This lady is awesome cause she's open minded.
Look at all the love she gets just for listening and having a rational discussion... See how easy it is?
"I really like this lady. Idk who she is, I bumped into this video by chance but she seems so genuinely interested but also highly educated and well spoken. It is just so nice to hear a calm conversation about charged topics."
"I like this woman. She's good, she listens and adds to the debate. I like her."
A couple of very intelligent Canadians have a very reasonable discussion.
"Blatchford passed away today.
Peterson is fighting for his life in Russia.

This video is more important today than ever."
"My favprite thing about this conversation is how damn relaxed both of them are. Dr. Peterson is literally laid-back, sipping coffee, arms open and just enjoying a reasonable chat with another person, instead of buttoned up and ready to defend himself from any angle of attack. What a diference from many other interviews."
"Thank you dear lady to ACTUALLY letting him speak and answer your questions for truth‚Äôs sake, not your feelings. THAT is a real journalist. THANK YOU!"
"It's so oddly refreshing to hear JP have an actual discussion with a woman who actually listens, behaves fairly rationally and seeks to reach a common understanding through their conversation."
Good on Christie Blatchford for being one of the few columnists to conduct a proper interview with Peterson. May her efforts and mode of conduct bear fruit that allows her to move up the ranks!
Jordan is such a breath of fresh air! Making sense of difficult topics
I could tell from the first 10 seconds that I was going to like this woman. She was visibly calm and genuinely LISTENING to JP.
Holy shit. An interviewer that asks relevant and non-abrasive questions? Must be Canadian.
"Christie Blatchford is a great Journalist. One of the few ""Good Reads"" left in Canada. She gets it!"
"""Having never had the fortune to spend time in an Iranian prison, they're not very good at distinguishing what constitutes a tyranny and a free society""! LOL Yep! he's quite right, unfortunately!"
RIP Christie Blatchford we lost a true warrior and great human being.
You know the world has gone to hell when it‚Äôs rare to see a civil conversation like this
Anyone else fascinated with how pretty the rainbow books are? Really really nice background.
"Peterson is a cool guy with a distinctly rational way of looking at things. It's refreshing, we need him. But can't help thinking that many people reading/watching him just mindlessly agree with everything he says because he is a ""genius"". And I'm sure not even JP himself wants that."
the part where he mentioned you can't divorce sexuality from everything and being central hits home.. this is what's wrong with current days.. people not taking responsibility of anything.
"The final piece here rings so true. As an educator, I have three cameras in my room at all times, one in my office with a 360 ceiling view and two in the classroom. Everything is there. The trust between myself and my students has always been there, but I'm covering my own rearside just in case."
Now this is a conversation. This is how we should be discussing these subjects or subjects in general.
Watching the way this woman listened and had a genuine conversation to explore a powerful topic was refreshing and beautiful to witness.
I like her
"Finally, Jordan is interviewed by an intelligent person and not one of Jim Henson's Muppets."
"These two are a breath of fresh air, a welcome oasis of intelligence & reason in a chaotic, mad and maddening world"
An interviewer who isn‚Äôt trying to demean and corner him?! She is actually having a conversation.
"FINALLY! Someone who actually listens.. WOW, what a completely different interview when a recipient ""ACTUALLY"" listen!!!"
"Listening to his interviews is so comforting, feels like there's still some sanity somewhere in this world."
"it feels so good to watch and listen to a conversation between two intelligent people that are not out to get the other, but to exchange ideas on the basis of respect"
This is a great discussion of two educated people sharing ideas and learning how to move forward through this societal issue
Christie is such a classy interviewer! She truly wants to hear his answers and engages brilliantly. üëåü§©
"im persian and i've spent time in an iranian prison, and i've lived here all of my 20 years... all i've ever wanted for myself and my people has been western laws that grant individual liberties, and to think you have a generation hell bent on eradicating that seems immeasurably moronic"
Metoo started out going after real offensive serial abusers and evolved into complaints about bad dates.
RIP Christie Blatchford. Not many like her left around.
Love that lady! Thank you for let us listen without interruption
"This is honestly one of the most captivating interviews I‚Äôve ever seen. The interviewer was the epitome of a professional and, as always, Jordan Peterson did a fantastic job explaining the impetus for ‚Äúsexual misconduct.‚Äù"
My main takeaway from this video is that the light purple book in the background has to go. It‚Äôs throwing off that colour gradient. I‚Äôm not actually sure what happened in this video as I couldn‚Äôt concentrate on anything other than that damn book. üòÇ
It's so refreshing to hear JP interviewed by someone who isn't trying to constantly attack him.
The way they talked was so refreshing. An actual fact based conversation with hints of personal opinion. Awesome
Wow. Great interview. Finally something engaging and curious without the needless confrontational questions he usually gets. Well done!
Amazing Woman! She is actually opened to honest dialogue and thinking. Excellent interview.
"There such a huge divorce between how people practically behave day-to-day and what people want to claim the 'rules' are. I've been hit on, not a million times, but it's happened, by men and women. Pretty much every time, the offer involved an initiation of physical contact. It's called 'making a move', we all know what that is, or at least we used to (It doesn't mean I got grabbed in my special place, it's usually a hand on a leg or something like that). It takes courage, and doesn't always go well. Sure, it wasn't always welcome on my side, particularly from another guy, but how petty and small of me to call it harassment, let alone sexual assault. If you live in reality, go to bars and clubs with horny drunk people looking for love, sometimes this will happen. That's life and being human, and to my mind not a particularly big deal. But suddenly, we lump those people under sexual assaulters, ruin their lives, and make it so people in general become afraid to engage in natural human interaction. All because a few idealists and young people thought they could define human behavior in two sentences of 'right' and 'wrong' based on their own desire to be free from having to ever deal with anything they didn't want to."
"The fact that this person even took the time to NOT interrupt him all the time, let him talk, have meaningful questions, allow for intellectual dissent between them... I know this was going to be good. I love this type of discourse."
I'd love to see more conversations like this.
a JBP video with no clickbait title???? im offended
Hoping Christie is doing well in her battle with Cancer. One of the few good ones.
"It's so refreshing to see someone discuss with Jordan Peterson in a rational manner, creating a proper, civilized and intellectual discussion."
beautiful interview. thanks for the discussion
"He is always spot on during interviews. She was an excellent speaker as well. Most women jump to the feminism, and all the rest of the negative bandwagons. 
It's a scary world for a man. Why are women making it that way? It's a shame."
‚ÄúNever have a meeting with a woman with the door closed ‚Äú this is our progress in 2020 !!
Christie Blatchford a legend and a real journalist. üôè RIP.
Dr. Jordan Peterson for PM!
I'm very impressed with how open minded this woman is! Mr Peterson receives a lot of hostility usually üëç
"Hi, Folks.
Hats off to both of them, Jordan for his in-depth analysis and his ability to cut through the shit and to express his views simply and to Christie for her open-mindedness and curiosity.


A good video.


Just my 0.02.


You all have a wonderful day. Best wishes. Deas Plant."
"When I saw that Jordan Peterson was being interviewed by Christie Blatchford I immediately had to watch this video.  It is so sad that we have lost such a great journalist.  Rest in peace Christie Blatchford, we miss you."
Really really like the way the woman (and Petersen obviously) carry themselves in this discussion.
And my mind cant stop saying: ‚ÄùThat book is more blue than purple‚Äù.....
"Who's disliking these videos? ""This man talks sense, I don't like it."" Really?"
"Just read that this lady died not long after this interview. I have never come across her before but what a refreshing thing to watch two grown ups having a decent discussion. RIP young lady, you sounded a very interesting woman."
I am tired of the term ‚Äúmicro aggression‚Äù. I feel like it advocates and encourages weak psychological and emotional maturity and strength.
I can already imagine the first civil claim for micro aggression. ‚ÄúHe ruined my night out at the bar... I want $500‚Äù.
"I have huge respect for this interviewer, she's actually listening to someone else's opinion instead of injecting question after question to just ignore what point Peterson just made"
"""I'm offended"" is nothing more than accepting you are unwilling to control your own emotions and expect others to do so for you."
"I love this, it‚Äôs an actual discussion with both parties actually listening to each other."
"I was so shocked the day I heard of her passing. 

A legendary Toronto journalist."
Why can't we have more women Interviewers like this woman? She is absolutely brilliant!!!
Thank God for this conversation!
"""Don't have a meeting with the door closed"", if that does not scare you, you need to think about it again..."
Sad how so many people rely on political programming to govern their behavior instead of just innate common sense and personal morality.
"ahh, a great conversation. It's nice to see someone jordan's talking to respond in a way other than ""so what you're saying is..."""
"""Having never really had the fortune to spend any time in an Iranian prison, for example, they're not very good at distinguishing between what constitutes a tyranny and what constitutes a free society.""  So damn true."
"You know things have gone really bad, when we are all happy to listen to a respectful, intelligent, normal conversation... 

Bless this woman for not being defensive nor agressive with and to him."
"""What are women now? We don't know."" 

I laughed at how simple that phrase is yet how much sense it makes given what he's discussing."
"She's a pretty good interviewer, and listens."
"As someone who has been a recipient of sexual harassment, I define it as repeated advances when it is clear that it is unwanted.

One guy that I was interviewing for a student paper when I was 18 grabbed me to keep me from leaving the room.  When you have to overcome a person's defenses to have sexual contact with them, that should be a clue. 

I think it goes beyond asking someone if they want to go out on a date and being turned down."
Society breaks down. Slowly. And we have universities as cesspools to breed these ideologies
I love JP and I thank God for having an opportunity to listen to his arguments on various social problems and concerns... It almost feels like many of my ignorant walls are being shattered down through his logical and wise comments... I hope more people from our society listen to him and come to realization of what's right and what's wrong on many unfair prejudiced social issues at hand...this is a war on ideology....
Heartening to see a true journalist!
I miss Christie Blatchford. She was an old school crime reporter. Always enjoyed her take on criminal trials. RIP Christie.
"Wow, she seems like one smart cookie. Prayers for more women like her."
"I could listen to these two talk all day. Such intelligence, understanding and respect."
"A video of intelligent discussion, can't say the same about the comment section though."
"each time I listen to MR Peterson,  I learn something new. thank you."
he's got my vote
I m a left leaning humanist ...and not a conservative at all...but Dr Jordan s someone I can listen to for hours. He s so intellectually honest and he respects traditional gender roles. It's so rare in men and in intellectuals that it shines through him . Respect.
"The real question is, why do the mainstream media not want to have a genuine conversation and why do they want to mislead their audience?"
I have so much respect for both of them. Heart-warming dialogue
"When is an action figure of Mr Peterson being created....!.? 
The man's a legend"
I sometimes disagree with Jordan but I think he's right on here.
"Rest in peace, Christie. One of the rarer champions of truth in this day and age, a trailblazer for due process and critical thinking, sadly a thing that was lost."
"""Every value system produces a hierarchy.  So if you dispense with the hierarchy you dispense with the value system.""  Brilliant."
"To all liberals and lefties out there, this is how you have a conversation about something important.
Notice no name calling, no wild assumptions, no accusations, no smearing, no crying, no screaming and no tantrums.... That's how it's done in a civilized society."
I‚Äôm buying a gun so that no one confuses my micro aggressions.
"Mr. Jordan, sir, you're such a blessing to humanity! Thank you for everything you be and do! You're the modern day Marcus Aurelius."
"""What upsets people is not things themselves but their judgements about these things."" - Epictetus"
The same women who pretend to be so offended made 50 Shades of Grey the fastest-selling book of all time.
"All feminist women want:
1. The authority of a man
2. The advantage of a woman
3. The accountability of a child"
"Feminist want the strength of men, the benefits of women and the responsibility of neither."
"Actually I‚Äôm a man and I love the fact that I no longer have to buy dinner or drinks or hold a door or pay for a movie for a woman. 
If I see a woman with a flat tire I can drive right by because she is my equal and can change it herself.  Woo hoo !!"
Just ignore the feminists hate. If they don‚Äôt want a man to be nice to them. Fine. Just walk on.
Chivalry is dead and a feminist pulled the trigger.
">MEM NEED TO STOP HARASSING ME !!!

"This is why prostitution should be legal all over America. If men are not allowed to approach women, give them compliments, and asking them out, the only option is to pay for sex. People would ask why so many young men are virgins, and it's because shit like this is discouraging them from being man enough to talk to women and asking them out on a date."
"Be respectful? If respect got men laid, we'd live in a nation full of gentlemen"
"Women: ""Men stop harassing women and leave us alone.""
Men: ""Ok, we'll stop and leave you alone.""
*A few moments later.*
Women: ""Why aren't men approaching women and ignoring us?""
Men: ""Huh, what the f*ck?"""
"Feminism's misandry ruins dating, families, children, communities, companies, vacations, everything. That is what this hate does and now we must deal with the fallout."
This society has become fucked. As much as say something nice to a woman about her physical appearance these days and you‚Äôve harassed them.

"- If when a woman accuses a man falsely and it is proven the man was innocent, then the woman receives the punishment the man would have gotten.

"Men, don‚Äôt shy away from being masculine or chivalrous. There are still women out here, like me, who appreciate that and want that in a man."
"Watch C.S. Lewis's ""On the Vital Necessity of Chivalry"" radio talk"
women really dont get it that men can easily be accused for sexual harrassment and yet men are seen as weak and sad because they refuse to take that gamble?
Feminist speak a bunch of crap. The majority of women want a masculine man. Ignore the women who tells you to leave her alone and go for the women who appreciates your masculinity
"A man held the door open for me yesterday and i said








Thank you."
There are times where I absolutely hate the me too movement. I mean support those coming out and standing up against abusers but the other part of me hates the fact that so many have blown this out of proportion and look for ways to get offended just so they can start shit. I‚Äôm actually a victim of a liar who framed me and ruined my life in college. The people of the me too movement who get offended so easily are the central reason why I get triggered and hateful towards others so easily. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to control my anger because I have Asperger‚Äôs Syndrome and Autism but on the surface the average person wouldn‚Äôt know it. The me too movement wants guys like me to apologize for how we are yet they don‚Äôt want to apologize to us for triggering and turning us into the monsters we never wanted to be. How about instead of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a freak! Stay away from me‚Äù try ‚Äúwhat can I do to help this person not be so mean.‚Äù I don‚Äôt judge others but something I definitely need to work on myself is not retaliating back and stooping to their level. The problem in my life is not those around me. The problem is me trying to get revenge on those and striking back twice as hard with an iron fist. I‚Äôve realized in recent months that the longer I hold onto that anger and resentment the more dangerous it becomes. So I try to spread positive and motivational messages to others struggling.
"‚ÄòNo Means No‚Äô is intended for getting physical, not being chivalrous.

If a women has a problem with chivalry, or makes a fuss about a man trying to be persistent; she‚Äôs not worth the time."
"Don‚Äôt touch, don‚Äôt look, don‚Äôt touch. They get pissed if you, they get pissed of you don‚Äôt. 
You‚Äôre better off getting a dog."
That was the most confusing part of the ad to me. It looked like he was going to go talk to her. What is wrong with that? How else are relationships supposed to start if people don't talk to people they find attractive?
Women in the work place have even become a liability to gay men
"They don't mind if you flirt with them.......just as long as they're attracted to you. Which is fine. Except the punishment for not fitting that mold is public persecution and maybe imprisonment. If you're not wyte you can say what you like to wyte women. If they start to ""get offended""  simply pull the race card. Genius. You ALL have it worked out."
"The world seems to have lost its way in every way‚Ä¶.

The scales are not balanced."
Me too should be made illegal.
"I had a young man recently compliment me on my appearance. He followed up by saying ‚Äú...if I‚Äôm allowed to say that.‚Äù I felt bad for him that he had to second-guess whether or not paying a compliment or saying something nice to someone would be okay. I mean, this is what young men have to worry about? Telling someone they think they are pretty? Crazy times."
Social media and dating apps have done even worse.
"My brother (at the time a 15y boy) was wrongly accused for rape together with a friend of his. 3 days in jail when the police didn't let them sleep and started interrogating them every half hour and threatened my 15 year old brother with violence if they didn't plead guilty.
Interrogation without sleep is forbidden in the Netherlands but the police did it anyway.

After three days the victim showed up and looked through a one sided blinded window and said she didn't recognize them, so they where free to go home without the police saying sorry to the boys.

I have three other stories where boys and young men are wrongly accused of rape and how society continues to blindly side with the so-called female victims.

It is scary how much evil can be done by women with the blind support of police and society. Women that are blackmailing to get their way in live are the worst!"
That ad made me switch to Dollar Shave Club lol
I think easily accessible internet porn has done equally if not more damage in a lot of these same aspects
So that‚Äôs why I struggle to connect with women I‚Äôm afraid of being seen as the bad guy or someone of ill intention
"Like, why can't.... like, college students like just ask like a question..........like wtf?"
I absolutely love how this has just 100% fizzled out of existence
"Chivalry has always been worthless, and there has never been a better time to be a man because it was never easier to be more of a man than the next guy than now."
100% has...women and men are weird socially and can only really communicate through means of text or whatever
"A guy : I don't want anything to do with a woman.
Me : #MeToo man."
"Real women still want chivalry and men with manhood, my woman loves it when I open the door for her and chit like that, the loonies are the ones that don't want it and don't deserve it"
"Dating will be like the Bumble app, where women have to initiate contact first"
"Glad I found a great woman to be my wife! 
We have had a wonderful marriage since 1991.
No wonder marriage is at an all time low. 
I can't imagine being a young man trying to find an honest girlfriend let alone a wife. 
Even talking to a woman or anyone else for that matter is a no win minefield.
Is this why so many peope 
'date' online and never meet the real person at the other end? 
I continue to be a chivalrous masculine man. 
No metro-sexual wimp dog for me. 
As Popeye would say:
'I am what I am'! 
That doesn't mean I don't treat everyone with respect. 
I just refuse to be intimated to give up my core values and I am not afraid to defend them. 
Peacefully and respectfully. 
But I don't suffer fools gladly. 
One cannot reason with someone whose arguments are not based on reason"
Don't even think about going out with a woman without getting it in writing it's okay.
"This is what women of today wanted.

They wanted to be strong, independent and proud in hopes only the Kens and Chads approach them. If it was an everyday man then they'll just look upon them with disgust and think of them as something low like a cockroach or thinking they only have one thing on their mind.

Most likely one of those Kens or Chads they are with would do them wrong then they will be like ""Oh where have all the good men gone?"" 

Well those good men are around, you have only went for one of the bad ones

Not only that, thanks to the MeToo movement certain men such as myself don't want to have the trouble and drama of being accused of something that is not true such as harassment even don't want to deal with anymore heartbreak and betrayal being left for someone else.

The question here being asked is what happened to dating? It is because men want to protect themselves and do not want no more hurt then they have endured. Of course their is that old stereotype that ""Men are tough, Men can endure pain and real men do not cry"" this and that but that's were they are wrong because their comes a limit where we just cannot take it anymore and become more cautious of ourselves where we do not want to deal with no more heartbreak and drama.

To those certain women who made this happen and including the MeToo Movement, Congratulations you have ruined dating and you wanted to be independent well then there you go, be careful what you wish for."
Wait is this scene from the commercial that they‚Äôre talking about a meme?
"Well said I actually had an experience where I wanted to give back my ex girlfriends sweater I didn‚Äôt feel right to just throw it away and I miss her but her sister works at a store and I made it very clear. I just wanted to give this back with no other intentions whatsoever, she appreciated  The gesture, was being polite to me in person, only to text me telling me to leave them alone, and although she appreciated adjuster she doesn‚Äôt want to have to be forced to interact with me just because she works there which baffled me because I‚Äôm thinking why doesn‚Äôt she like me because I dated her sister? Or is it something more but anyways great video"
I honestly try not to make too much eye contact with women.
"I did that very thing... It was during a ""oktoberfest"" in Michigan, I had seen the girl twice with a couple of hours so I went up to her, introduced myself to her, told her she was beautiful and that I would love to go out with her.... She said sure we met the next weekend for a few drinks and dinner, I couldn't get over how ""hot"" she was but there we were. It wasn't the most comfortable date I ever went on but I was a total gentleman...she said she had a good time... Now when I look back I probably could have been a little more aggressive.. But the date just ended with a kiss on the cheek and that was it....
I was in my early 20's. This was in the late 70's."
Chilvary is gone
"I'm glad I'm middle aged . I wouldn't want to have been born in the early 2000s. These poor kids are going to be programmed to be incels by the me-too generation.

Things haven't changed over here in the U.K.  Women still like sex.
Walsh is really good at being really right but also really wrong. It‚Äôs quite fascinating.
MGTOW
That was the one part of the ad that really blew my mind. It looked like the guy was just smitten and wanted to talk to her. The hell is wrong with that??
Me too has been humbling.
It‚Äôs sexual harassment to her if she finds you unattractive. If you are handsome to her then it‚Äôs flirting.
"This kid used ""like"" more than my 12 year old son, it was hard to listen!!!"
I understand completely. I slapped a women on the butt the other day and she took it the wrong way. Lol
Doesn‚Äòt Gillette‚Äòs future earnings depend on men successfully asking women on dates (long term that is)?
Wow I didnt know Matt Walsh was the host of The Matt Walsh Show.

"Of course it‚Äôs wrong to go up and talk to a woman or interact with a woman, and if you were eventually to get to know that woman and have any sort of intimate relationships that‚Äôs physical and sexual assault if things go bad,to be safe there should be no contact between the sexes"
"Watch the movie if I remember the name correctly, ""Cherry 2000""."
"You really have to get off social media and go after what you want. Don‚Äôt let the haters get to you. Misery loves company. Although in this case if everyone isn‚Äôt talking to each other then everyone is alone .... together. Lol. 

We all know what going too far is so we don‚Äôt need people making up rules on how to live our lives. Yes there are bad people but if you assume someone is bad then even the smallest awkward moment made from nerves of talking to a pretty girl will seem bad."
"I don't understand why guys were offended over that particular scene. While I hated the ad, it's obvious that they were implying that he was not going to approach her respectfully and instead was going to catcall/be a nuisance. I mean, look at the build up and his reaction the moment he saw her, haha. Also, approaching a woman who's walking somewhere is probably going to be a bad move in general."
Get your passports
"Would it be possible to make a ""daily wire shorts"" account so I don't get 10 videos for every video I already watched?"
Yeah but guys stopped pursuing and asking girls out back probably in the '90s? Maybe before then? Maybe this is because of feminism? Maybe this is because gender roles have been skewed and men are less manly and have been discouraged. I'm just saying I think this is not a new thing
"""Like,"" ""like,"" ""like""..."
"""A year or 2 ago""? That was from EARLIER THIS YEAR!!"
Maybe it's time for us to start doing like the Indians did. But it's going to be kinda awkward for you city Dads to put the Horses up you got for your Daughter.

"Welcome to 2015, I guess?
If a crappy ad from a couple of years ago ruined dating for you and completely destroyed what you consider manhood or ""chivalry"", maybe you should do some self-reflection on whether you have any self-confidence or self-control left.
OR you're using this as an excuse or an explanation for why you suck at it?
Both possibilities are sad anyway."
I think men should always make the first move.

The future isn't female. It's digital.

Men: My wallet, my money."
#MeToo is causing a severe recession in the Golddigging industry.

Amber Heard has made a mockerey of this movement.
The future is robot sophiea..
MGTOW is Also on The Horizon As Well
I think I'll just stay home and avoid getting too close to anyone forever
"I have never been raped or sexually harraseed or bullied but my support goes to the men and women who have. Lets get rid of predators in power. Men and women who sexually exploit those beneath them. Eventually, the world needs to focus on molestation at the forefront. This is one of  the biggest crime that plagues humanity."
"I'm not a feminist, and this movement ticked me off for various reasons... But as a South African lady, I can confirm that there is a bit problem with domestic abuse towards women in this country."
"I served in the Armed Forces,when in uniform i had my arse felt,crouch,and one woman tried to pull me into a toilet on a train,#hypocrites"
"If i may ask, what does metoo and the phrase ""the future is female"" have in common? The combination makes it look like this is about power."
"According to feminism, both genders are equal... Just that women are more equal."
This move is going to cost up-and-coming marriages for years to come.
The future is AI
where's the virtual reality for how it feels like to be falsely accused?
why is my dishwasher not working

"Against me too. Not against women but absolutely amd all the way against me too. Just because it judges the whole male population as one entity,  rather than focusing on the problems caused by some disorderly  individuals. This movement is totally and most important  blindly against half the population of the earth. My stand has changed towards women after that, because I don't know if one specific woman is a supportive or not of this movement. So I don't talk to women,  don't flirt, don't walk close to them, dont  say goodmorning  or hello to any woman, don't ask for help if I see a woman in a store, don't interact at all. In this case the movement 's ideals and standards have neen met and it is absolutely keeping me as a man - that it knows I am as a male a Hazzard to society- away from all the females of this planet.  So yes the future is female and I don't  want to be a part of this  future. Men gowing  their own way, away from women."
As a business owner I will never even consider hiring a woman not worth it

"Millions of young men recruited for war have died as well. Mostly for the wealthy class owners of the world and mainly for mineral and oil resources. These young men died to protect and secure the rights of their countrymen (and women) to speak out freely for any cause they wished. So, in effect, young men are being taken advantage of and being 'body sold' (trafficked) on a much larger scale and for a much longer period of time because they are existentially expendable to the battle field. Women don't actually have that burden, but they do frequently suffer men's primal instincts as men often suffer theirs, only differently."

Best way to deal with women in the workplace is to interact with them as little as possible.

"Me Too in a nutshell 30 years ago a man did something I didn't like.... I never said anything about it until now but without evidence, proof, or any fact believe me and punish the man assuming he is guilty and even if he is proven innocent treat him as though he were guilty. Then call everyone who disagrees a misogynist."
"So wait what about the guys who were falsely accused oh wait ""Future is female""."
Jordan Peterson is my hero.
#Metoo and #feminisn ere more negative than positive right now
"The real beauty of all this is that it will show men that they are inherently toxic, and should pursue their passions and livelihood WITHOUT women, so as not to cause them any trouble. 

Womanists, don't even tell me that you are offended by this... or even call me names... If you do either, you may as well admit that you really are NOT strong NOR independent.. and that you DO need men... and having those beliefs is misogynistic. Thank you."
You just have to understand that I want to live in an equal society. The movement started because women need respect . Just never become what you fight.
Metoo has made it so complicated and risky for man and women to work together that it is better to segregate them at workplace
Movements come and they go as always.

"Wow, they are putting VR reprogramming devices on the faces of men now? I worked in education for many years. Female dominated industry. I have been flashed by a female coworker because i wouldn't feel how perky her breasts were. Two female bosses would walk up and rub my back while grading papers, comment on my muscles. Refused a coworkers advances on a few occasions, one would end up stalking me for over a month. She would sit in my truck leave notes, spray perfume etc. She even said she was going to kill herself over the situation; this particular situation happened in the early 90s just as companies were adopting sexual harassment training policies. So, I'm gonna sit through the rest of this video and role my eyes, thank you very much"

"If men express themself emotionally they will get exploited by woman whenever its beneficial to them and at the same time get told they should hate themself as men for being a man....masculinity is a male choice for us to accept as it is and how we choose to be, if not expressing myself is part of masculinity then it should be my choice and be left to it."
How come they never interviewed the accused for their side of the story .

Let's  use a dramatization of a situation to change things with this Virtual Reality product that will make men understand what only women see. Ok sure...
The disconnect in the #MeToo movement is that many (if not all) of the female Hollywood actors who initially came forward to protest sexual harassment and sexual assault at the hands of Hollywood producers and directors were perfectly content to allow themselves to be sexually objectified on screen in exchange for large sums of cash.  Is it altogether surprising then that these women were treated as sexual objects by the same men who paid them in the first place?   Women can't both use their sexuality as a means to get what they want from men and then at the same time expect that men will not look at and treat them as sexual objects.
"Grats feminists 

You‚Äôve completely cancelled human interaction altogether 

Hope your happy :)"
"Remember, Ego's, we have masculine and feminine inside of each and everyone of us; in past lives you have been both. The rising of women does not mean the fall of men, maybe monsters but if your not one of them you have nothing to worry about. The healthy masculine without insecurities of his own power will never feel the need to put someone below himself, he will not be afraid of having his other half in an empowered state. Thank you Lilith, Kali Ma, Mother Mary, and Lord Sananda and all the brave sisters and brothers of humanity that are stepping into the light of truth and justice. I bless all ignorant, asleep beings who can't see the need for this movement with pure love and light, with pure source consciousness, with balanced feminine and masculine energy. ‚ô°‚ô•‚ô°‚ô•"
"At, my health club, I've watched, men walk away from women, the women want to be noticed by the men, but the men will leave, women standing alone, in an area, of the gym and return when the woman leaves,"

"Apparently not a single man has ever been sexually assaulted or harassed according to this narrative, what a relief, I suppose it must have been another ""Misogynistic"" hallucination of memory"
"Do we still need feminism? Yes.
Do we need feminism in developed countries like America? Absolutely not."
"I've been harrassed 10 times worse than that! My whole goddamn office has been abusive to me a lot of days, more than I can count. I'm the one doing most of the work, and they talk the most shit! There's no such thing as justice in this world. U have to make your own!"

I hope that all fake-accusers will be sentenced and punished.
"It's not hard, seriously its common sense.  Men and women, would you be happy if your son or daughter or sister or friend was being treated as your talking to your co-worker, then go ahead. If not change  that behaviour"
"For starters she's way overdone the makeup which women use to attract men while at the same time calling a mans attention to her harassment. Women are truly illogical with their emotions switching by the minute and of course are ALWAYS the victim.Men won't put their hands up and say ""Ok ladies you win"" Experienced men know how to play a woman that lets her think she's in charge and so the age old game will go on and all this bullshit will only appeal to the idiots who suck it up."
"#youtoo, me? I stand up for myself."
Why respecting is not taught in schoolsüò§
These women should think about their sons.
How about we tell women they need to man up and start talking to men and risk being rejected.
Pure propaganda
"The idea that ""we don't know what the rules are"" is total bs. Treating people with respect shouldn't come as a surprise."
"I think that some things are being mixed here. I totally agree with the right of women to not being sexually harassed, and I think men who do such things are not real men. However I don't see why the video also want to speak about the gender disparity in positions of power. I remember Jordan Peterson saying something about this issue, which is: there has been plenty of time for women to reach positions of power, and yet there is this gender gap there. I don't think that women are less capable intellectually or anything, but I do think that men and women are different. There's no such thing as the ""right to be in a position of power"", because, by definition of power, that's not how it works. There might be rules of course, written or not written, but I don't think gender distinction should be done to favor one or the other.


Clearly this is a lot (infinitely) more complicated than this, and obviously I think it's good that women speak up about untold harassment."

Asking a girl he likes to come and watch/support something he enjoys and participates in (a very normal thing to do).
Guy 2 - tries to see a positive side to a dark outlook on life that she brought up (a healthy thing to do). Apologizes when she takes it the wrong way (a good and polite thing to do). Indicates that some men do bad things but trying to find a way to get her to trust despite that (a normal thing to do).
Guy 3 - feels uncomfortable with her dark assumption of him (very normal for a first encounter). Tries to sympathize with her and make her feel more comfortable (a very normal and good thing to do). Expresses frustration when she intentionally misconstrues his sentiment on multiple occasions (very very very very normal thing to do).

As if her hand in writing this was unknowingly guided by the most holy and lead to create pure cosmic tragicomedy.

"I fully believe the reason I've spent my entire college career locked up in my apartment online with my friends is because:
1. I'm more introvert than extrovert
2. I'm convinced that college culture/most women will dislike me for my non-con-formative views.

I was told for my entire life that college was suppose to be a great time in my life, and there have been good times, but its mostly been me cringing at how brainwashed society has become in believing the narrative.

Its sad too. There are a lot of great guys out there that are good people, but society and the media have convinced half the population that they are evil. Most of these guys are super normal and coming from humble backgrounds. But I'm white and male so I guess playing video games, hunting, reading, writing D&D stories and grabbing a drink with my friends makes me ""privileged"" or a bad person.
Despite my parents working from paycheck to paycheck for everything we have. A voice in the back of my head tells me to wait until everyone else grows up and I'm well established in life before dating. But I'm young and I want to find someone special in my life. We want the same thing, but I'm not accusing you of crimes you haven't committed."
Wow!  I don't think I've ever cringed so hard.
My faith in humanity as portrayed by the massive dislike ratio has been restored.

"Call me a definitional purist all you want but this doesn‚Äôt fit the definition of satire. 

Satire is ‚Äúthe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues‚Äù. The only way this is satire is if she is criticizing herself for her beliefs which she clearly isn‚Äôt since she is presenting one perspective: her outlook on the world. She believes wholeheartedly in what she says and believes she sneak this by as ‚Äúsatire‚Äù by adding a ukulele... not so fast!"

One question. What do you want to do about it beside whine?
"With little notice, President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order that advocates say rolls back hard-fought victories for women in the workplace. Tuesday's ""Equal Pay Day"" ‚Äî which highlights the wage disparity between men and women ‚Äî is the perfect time to draw more attention to the president's action, activists say. On March 27, Trump revoked the 2014 Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order then-President Barack Obama put in place to ensure that companies with federal contracts comply with 14 labor and civil rights laws. The Fair Pay order was put in place after a 2010 Government Accountability Office investigation showed that companies with rampant violations were being awarded millions in federal contracts. In an attempt to keep the worst violators from receiving taxpayer dollars, the Fair Pay order included two rules that impacted women workers: paycheck transparency and a ban on forced arbitration clauses for sexual harassment, sexual assault or discrimination claims. Noreen Farrell, director of the anti-sex discrimination law firm Equal Rights Advocates, said Trump went ""on the attack against workers and taxpayers."" ""We have an executive order that essentially forces women to pay to keep companies in business that discrimination against them, with their own tax dollars,"" said Farrell. ""It's an outrage."" Out of the 50 worst wage theft violators that GAO examined between 2005-2009, 60 percent had been awarded federal contracts after being penalized by the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division. Similar violation rates were tracked through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Labor Relations Board. Now isn't that order very consistent with the sexual criminal confessions we all heard not once. but on two separate occasions during the Axis Hollywood bus. previous to that during his interview with Howard Stern. Former prosecutor Gov. FBI director Giuliani. Said those audiotaped criminal confessions were nothing more than locker room talk. Not according to criminal psychologist brain specialist those audiotaped criminal confessions were much more consistent with a jailhouse confession from one inmate to another. Or a prison reminiscence from one convict to another who are living out there sentencing in protective custody, for sexual crimes are classified as the weakest form of criminal conduct. Not to mention any other prosecutor in the country would take two audiotaped criminal confessions as enough evidence to prosecute. And then when you have 14 witnesses come forward and validate everything that was on those audiotaped criminal confessions.Would be enough evidence to convince any judge of a conviction. Well any judge except for that desperate week insecure impulsive poor specimen of a female judge that goes on and on about how great it is being a submissive trumpet blower. And you wonder why America has the highest violent crime rate in the world. You wonder why America has the highest drug addiction alcohol dependency in the world. And you wonder why America has the most overfed undernourished people in existence. is not all gloom and doom. We can deal with this situation. As a people as physically fit mentally sound and spiritually balanced Americans. At the same time we are dealing with the situation in life. Subconsciously spiritually there souls and spirits are being implemented with, all the pain suffering disease sickness illness torment and hunger that has been allowed to occur over the years manifesting into what it is today. Thanks to incompetent lazy ignorant reckless negligent vindictive criminal leaders supporters employees employers. And now going to get far worse if Donald Trump his submissive trumpet blowers desperately impulsive employees have their way. Now let us thank our heavenly father for allowing Ronald Reagan Donald Trump supporters followers employees like-minded people for subconsciously: coherently apparently volunteering their soul and spirit to function similar to an air purifier water filtration system steam cleaner rubber gloves sponge shield bedpan urinal ass wipes blowup doll. But plug tampon maxi pad diaper jump rope ankle weights wrist weights weighted vest punching bag so forth and so on. Etc. etc. and that is the short list of how their souls and spirits are being treated. Before we get into how their souls and spirits are going to be implemented with all the pain suffering disease sickness illness torment and hunger that has occurred over the years manifesting into what it is today. Keep in mind my submissive trumpet blowers the soul and spirit can endour one up to  billions of years worth of pain suffering disease sickness illness torment and hunger .that is just a sample Of the miraculous power of spirituality eternal authority that exist beyond your comprehension for your life cannot commonly comprehend things past your life's expectancy. Now I wish and pray for my soul and spirit to be held spiritually accountable to the statements I proclaim. I guarantee you will never hear another body leader person of legal authority ever validate the statements they proclaim with that level of certainty. If the sun the father the Holy Spirit God the devil Lord Jesus or anyone else with true eternal power and authority over life and death. Felt differently about the statements on proclaiming the had four separate opportunities to keep me dead and silent. The bottom line is you're either part of the problem are part of the solution when it comes to equality between a man and a woman as well as respecting another persons physical freedom. See a dominant gentleman knows how to intelligently persuade passionately convincing a woman to have the desire to willingly want to share themselves romantically. your part of the problem are solution. Either way your being held spiritually accountable. One way comes with a pleasant form of rehabilitation physically mentally spiritually. And the other way is the opposite of the first way. Again I wish and pray for my soul and spirit to be held spiritually accountable to the statements I proclaim. I guarantee you will never hear another body leader person of legal authority ever validate the statements they proclaim with that level of certainty. One reason they don't know themselves therefore they have NO respect for themselves and can't respect others. Secondly is because they are not willing to hold themselves accountable to the way they live their life to the laws the put in place. For the laws they put in place will greatly influence whether you live and die Feeling accomplished being at peace. The bottom line is Donald Trump has been clinically diagnosed by criminal psychologist brain specialist! Leading physicians As being physically and mentally submissive! To fill that massive void a weakness) His plan to stay on the top! Is by keeping the bottom sick week desperate hungry and malnourished and poor by recirculating dirty low-paying jobs that come from outdated power sources inferior materials and toxic substances. That have lived out there usefulness for they have been classified scientifically as petrified death! More commonly known as coal oil and gas dirtiest of all sand oil. Along with other toxic chemicals that never changed their killing composition. You cannot promote life by using a substance that diminishes the quality of our air water food and landscapes. Dirty low-paying jobs very few at that however will have a negative effect on hundreds of millions for only God knows how many generations dirty low-paying jobs that diminish the quality of our air water food and landscapes with the potential of causing environmental collapse there is no profit to be made in the demise of the planet businessman my ass! Just look at the BP oil spill. The man-made water crisis situation in Flint Michigan. The man-made water crisis situation at the military base known as Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The fly ash spill that occurred from Duke Power in North Carolina. Those are a few examples. . . Of the irreversible damage that comes from working with outdated power sources inferior materials toxic substances. That have been scientifically classified spiritually validated as being physically mentally useless therefore have no true value spiritually. Now a dominant gentleman or lady that knows how to demonstrate high-class sophistication which is femininity at its finest!! for it is raw wild naturally hard-core organically appealing truly captivating absolutely eternally spiritually sought after by the gods and goddesses of the ancient royalty, warrior elite...... knows the best way to stay on the top is by keeping the bottom confidently rising in the most efficient way that is humanly possible, allowing each generation to become stronger smarter healthier happier financially better off. For that possibility of a reality to come full circle. The people must have clean high-paying jobs that used new technology. Allowing the people to fully utilize on advanced self sustainable renewable power sources. New Age top notch materials resources, that you could use this much is you would like or need without leaving any excess toxic waste behind.  equally as amazing our products can be) Manufactured  mass-produced in state of the art facility's I am talking about clean high-paying jobs from coast-to-coast globally.

"""Every opinion I have is still based on the athlete's mom, but I will say that the most frustrating feeling in the world was to feel like nobody believed me,"" Tara Jones tells VICE News.

Watch more on #MeToo here: http://bit.ly/2EX1vZd"
It pissed me off so much how they got into false accusations so fast. I‚Äôm glad that other lady brought that up.
"""Parenting"". Shows only mothers. Does Vice not realize that they left out half the perspectives needed in a conversation like this?"
Well I guess Vice doesn‚Äôt need to include a father figure.
you need to label satire when you make it
Ok vice is trolling at this point...
"""I feel worried all the time. ¬†Like worried that he's doing good in school, worried that he's ok at practice, worried that nothing's bad is happening to him..."" Holy Freud!"
To all the people commenting these young male athletes need to treat women like people not like objects need to ask yourself how do these girls treat these young men in the first place? Why do you think they're throwing themselves at them in the first place? I tell you why - they view them as success objects. Objectification works both ways.
Talk to the father's
I'm so confused. The woman of the far right side of the couch said that she would dismiss accusations against her son because she knows him but then she said that you are not 100% with your son all the time and you never know what he might do.
I feel that Overbearing mothers fathering their sons is not a viable replacement for a solid father figure in a young mans life.
I‚Äôm too ugly to worry about the #metoo movement
I wonder why there is not a dad in this interview
"At least, the moms with sons are waking up more than the moms with daughters."
A man breathed in front of me without my consent. #Metoo
"Statistics prove that having the paternal mother and father in the house, raising them as a team on the same page is how you will get good outcomes. Depressing men and overcorrecting them will eventually lead to a situation no women want, and that‚Äôs a lack of strong men."
the amount of well deserved shit that vice gets in these comments gives me hope
"Sometimes being so young and naive, you only think you're smart... I was that 20 year old who thought I was smart... ended up hanging with the wrong crowd, getting bullied... life is a lesson, yes."
These moms seem like part of the problem
Keep perpetuating your victim mentality vice... it seems constructive.
"I dont understand why people dislike this video this much. Those mothers are criticizing the metoo movement, so that should basically attract all the right wing trolls. Wheres the problem with this video I just cant see it, somebody tell me please."
My 16 year old son is mgtow . This is why. Too much drame he claims.
"Only a father knows what's going on in a young boys head especially through puberty. To leave out the fathers in this discussion is simply shows ignorance especially when you put ""parents"" in the title."
"Great video vice! such important discussions, keep them coming"
lol the dislikes tho
how many garbage videos can vice post in 1 day?
"I found this discussion very interesting. It was also cool to see this discussed in a way that doesn't immediately try to discount the perspective of one party or another but tries to reconcile them.

It seems like some commenters found a way to be offended anyway, but I don't see any of them citing specific statements in the video that they disagree with. It looks more like a general anger at this whole social phenomenon."
It's not just atheletes.  I grew two beautiful men by myself. This is so self indulgent to me. I come from a country full of atheletes.  This is a global age old problem and needs a far broader conversation
This is the worst day in the history if vice
"No one seems to want to learn progressive, healthy, fair, respectful, mature relationship skills and do the psychological and emotional and self-improvement labour work of building relationships anymore.  Long-needed change is being idly complained about and rejected when that is the ONLY thing humans can count on in life besides pain and death.  So, how and where do people with above average ethics, values, convictions and personal politics find those rare others who are ready, willing and able to do the interesting and enjoyable work of relationship building?  Always said is, ""surround yourself with good people.""  Well, where ARE those ""good people""?!?"
"Saying that an athlete has ""more to lose"" is really false. We all have things that are important to us, an athletic career isn't any more valuable than another persons reputation or career. Any  woman who speaks up against an athlete for sexual assault, no matter the truth, is going to come up against scrutiny and some threats from other people. People usually know the implications of speaking up because it's a big risk that may not pay off."
I agree with the moms when they say me too is over corrected
She compared the Me Too movement to the Opioid situation...
"I have to agree....I was wondering where the fathers are. Also....it's kind of interesting how their views flip flopped once they had sons. I know parents believe the best about their children, but children hide a lot from their parents. I know my siblings in a different way than my mom knows them ;)"
Idc what the sexual assault definition is to her the only thing that matters is the legal definition
"Wow I'm disappointed. Having a conversation about how not to raise a rapist is really important (especially to me personally, because I was assaulted). Yet the questions mainly revolved around them being apologetic and why. Here's a tip for these moms: if you want to raise a good boy, don't view him as such without him proving it through his actions. If you give your son the leeway of being moral, simply for being your son, then YOU ARE RAISING MANIACS. -.-"
Is vice satire now? Like the onion?
"Your different son.
Why Mom? 
You throw a football."
4:45 I think they should get a room
Where‚Äôs my vice gone?
I wasn't a fan of the short haired interviewer but every one else had good points not sure why this video is getting so much hate
"I feel sorry for those womans children, poor souls."
Athletes should be scared. Young men should be cautious and respectful. People need to be monogamous now more than ever. Never mind getting with a guy or girl to just have sex and move on.
"There was a time NO means YES and YES means let's have an orgy... 
Over correction is better... Just like when you try to grade essays or papers... The first one is the hardest to judge until you read all the papers and learn to correct those biases as you go on... Fear of the Exception  rather than the Rule is more harmful in any society..... Killing a human being is not all bad.... as we tried to classify them to  self defense, murder etc to make room for what justice really means...and lines are drawn here too..."
"i dont get why THIS video is getting so much hate, people literally not watching the video. the women even said that they changed their stance on the issue and also that the young gerneration is overeacting to this and is too sensitive. so watch the damn video you youtube  conservatives!"
Wow overcorrected??
"The #MeToo is a  real issue but it is one that can get out of control.  Any accuser, male or female, should be invited to take a polygraph test to support and give credence to their accusations.  I know these tests not 100% but it takes some coaching and practice to defeat one and most people aren't aware of that.  The results of the test can be kept confidential but the fact that it's there would discourage false accusations and there's far too much of that going on."
Using Tobani on this is just wrong. Cuz this is her time wasted.
"Include the dads, although I‚Äôm not sure the black ladies are married"
No men in the couch I love it
an actual sensible take on the topic
This one is alright compared to the other videos Vice and has made about the movement.
And Vice has gone the way of Vox. We have lost another news source.
Im gonna get rich off a consent app.
This video should be studied for what it says about today's social environment.
Vice sucks now. unsubscribed
Jordan Peterson full interview please
"So sad to see vice go this way. I guess it's time to move on and look for some more objective news sources. 

Terrible shame, especially for their field reporters doing such great work overseas. To have them mixed in with this obviously guided conversation with a strict agenda is a waste."
Everyone should see this
Overcorrected..? This must be a joke. So many points were missed & mothers who speak with this uncertainty on the issues of RIGHT AND WRONG are doing a disservice to the movement.

"Moved forward? The whole movement was stupid to begin with, me too, well sure, now prove it, just yelling me too does not mean anything"
I thought the #MeToo movement died after Kavanaugh was confirmed to the SC.
"the absolute biggest fucking joke out of this is meryl streep wearing black for ""solidarity""  she's the one that started the petion to have roman Polanski allowed back in the country because she thinks raping a 13 year old girl multiple times is fine."
"When a movement results in the infringement of the rights of others, in terms of DUE PROCESS, it should NEVER be allowed in the court system. If MSM continues to support unprovable accusations, then THEY should be held liable. Part of being an ADULT, is TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS, which means not putting yourself in a position when and where abuse may occur. Sexual abuse has been around since the beginning of time so you can't claim ignorance, but you might be able to blame your mother for not raising you with any common sense. You'd have to be born, and raised, under a rock not to know that at the forefront of the majority of these abusive environments is in the entertainment industry. Any idiot knows that. But apparently we're having an IDIOT epidemic right now. If the roles were reversed and you had to PROVE your innocence...could you? Think about it...although thinking really isn't your strong suit, is it?"

Funny lol
What happened to its face ?
I'm staying single.
The word... 'Mgtow' is getting closer to mainstream conversation
"""Women waiting for men to make the first move""
Men: that's gonna be a long wait."
At 48 years of age and retired. I'm just sitting back and enjoying the slow demise of western society.
"Men are more reluctant to approach women.
Even I am and I used to do it a lot. 
You did it to yourselves ladies."
A man can't lose in the dating game if he never plays!!! MGTOW has grown in recent years because of the #MeToo movement.
"I think it's funny how everything is the man's fault, never the woman's fault."
"I was at Aldi.. when I saw a woman struggling with her arms filled with groceries,  I had a cart with a  bag of potato chips,  I offerd to help her,  I knew that I  was wrong from the moment I opened my mouth..she told me exactly where to go, I will never help, or offer to help, another woman as long asI live"
A man who truly loves his children will NOT conceive them into a world like this. Keep them inside fellas.
MGTOW more popular than ever. Good job women!
She's right about the part '...but women aren't willing to change' .
Keep a close eye on those birth statistics. Should be interesting.
"Dating is dead.
Marriage is dead.
Birth rates are crashing.
48% of all newborns are to single mothers.
Good luck trying to reverse these trends with VAWA, The Duluth Model, YesMeansYes, femcorrect diversity hiring and promotion quotas and then piling on MeToo.

Before it was ambiguous and people could laugh it off.
MeToo has removed all of the masks.
Now there is no question that women now represent a massive legal and financial liability and risk to any man, and to any business as well.
Thing is, how can women undo the damage already done?
They can‚Äôt put the genie back in the bottle such that men will be sacrificial and deferential all over again."
"Thanks but no thanks, I'll be staying single and protecting women from my toxic money."
"This is the sad reality to life, where women always expect a change in their men but want their men to accept them for the person they are. Women want to get treated like queens with out treating their men like kings...we make everything about our women we empower our women only for our women to compare themselves to us men and want the same treatment as a man. There's a reason a man is called a man and a woman is called a woman, what the world needs to stop doing is comparing the struggles of a man to the struggles of a woman, our struggles are not the same"
"If men are saying they want more women to make the first move, then why are women complaining men aren't being more assertive?  ...in this era of the ""liberated woman""?
Hmmmm??"
Now alot more women can grow old with their cats !!!!
"""Why don't men open up?""
Men opened up and we got ""Muh emotional labor"".
""Why don't men discuss their issues?""
Men approached you with times they were abused and we got Johnny Depp.
""Why don't men approach anymore?""
Because you said feminism was destroying harmful gender roles and because we got metooed."
You are correct for more than just dating culture. I stopped dating and my hiring practices have changed drastically. Once you realize that you don't need women. You will realize that your need for material gain disappears and you'll find yourself doing what you want without being held back by a modern materialistic women.
It's caused many men to start looking overseas for partners. The western women seem to have become overly sensitive.
"I just quit asking women out.

Problem solved.

If a woman doesn‚Äôt ask me out, I don‚Äôt go out."
Gillette's commercial said that guys shouldn't talk to women.
"I lived by these rules all my life before this movement and it served me well:

Never initiate physical contact with a  woman. Let her make the move.

If you're alone with a woman like a coworker, make sure there is either a 3rd person present, the door is open or it's in public. 

Wait until she makes the first greeting."
"It was too late before I figured this out üòÇ got kicked out of college for looking at a girl I didn‚Äôt even remember her face. She said she felt threatened for a whole week üòÇüòÇ and I don‚Äôt even remember her face. 

Good job women gooooood job"
"The later you marry, the more likely it is you stay married? How do you figure that? Almost everyone in my parents generation have been divorced at least once in their lives and their parents, the generation that saw marriage as a holy oath, actually stayed married until death and they usually got married in their early twenties.."
I changed my behavior to avoid women altogether. Worked like a charm. I have money and mental health now.
"I'm indian before this movement my parent's advice ""don't go alone with a girl"""
SINCE I BECAME MGTOW  MY BANK ACCOUNT HAD AN INCREASE OF 300%  IN LESS THAN A YEAR. I AM LOVING IT.
"How men have changed their behavior:
They avoid women at all costs out of fear of being falsely accused or misunderstood what the woman was thinking in her head.
Congrats."
"""Women waiting for men to make the first move"". Men: What move?"
I love it. More and more men avoid  the bad contract called marriage.  Great news.
"I'm part of the 51% of men who have changed their behavior. Never will be alone with a female who is not close family. Never will give assets to a female who is not close family. I assume that a little over half of all single women are infected, and all are willing to make false accusations if they disapprove of anything I say or do."
I will never get married. I don't want to lose all of my savings to divorce lawyers.
Look up Mgtow on youtube. Then you'll understand.
"Women:   The wage gap is unfair !   Equal pay equal work !
Also women:  I want a man who earns more than me, and I refuse to settle for less.
Also women: There are no good single eligible men out here for us !"
"Women will be all alone, more vulnerable and more miserable in the future. Riding the CC until 35 and then asking the question ""Where are all the good men gone?"" isn't going to help anyone."
My financial situation prevents me from finding love too. I like to keep my money!
Yeah i don‚Äôt even speak to female humans anymore I‚Äôm not trying to get accused of anything.
We're not being reserved out of respect for a woman.  We are reserved because we now have the fear of being socially and financially persecuted.  Metoo has achieved its goal but the outcome is extremely one sided.
"She's sugarcoating men losing interest. There is no light at the end of the tunnel for women, but there is for men. Men are being more productive, and women are needing men more than ever. Feminism has really backfired. The more things change, the more they stay the same. We're becoming a different kind of tradcon."
"MGTOW, an understandable response to Feminism & the ""Me too"" movement. Congratulations ladies!"
"I thank the Lord I was born in the 70s . I am happily married for 18 years...
Nowadays a woman can ruin a man with false accusations . Even when it is proven that the woman lied , nothing happens to her."
"The laws are crap, don't get married, and don't help women when they can't breathe, if you give them CPR, they'll sue you for assault."
"No wife, happy life."
This didn‚Äôt age well.  Marriage rates and birth rates are way down.
Women are being manipulated to believe that movements such as the MeToo are good. The result is simply that no business owners managers want to be alone with a women anymore. The risks are just great when compared to hiring men.
"""A smart man learn from his mistakes, A wise man learn from other's mistakes""
Sometimes the key to win is to not Play the Game in the first place."
"This woman is not even trying here. Her male colleague asks how and what changes, and we get her own random postive interpretation. He asks if it's an OVER correction, and she erases the word over in her reply directly. Wtf, can she not hear him correctly or just that deluded?"
Doesn't affect my dating life.  I'm a misogynist.
"I agree...let women send me flowers, chocolates, ask my number, ask me out for a dinner and explain to me why I should date them sacrificing my time and energy and I will consider if I will accept her invitation or Friendzone-her...until I will be asked out I can enjoy my good time alone...."
"It's not worth the risk ,MGTOW"
About 8 years ago I remember telling someone that because men are all assumed pedophiles by society I no longer acknowledge  the presence of children unless they speak to me first or are with an adult. And if I find myself alone in a room with one I leave that room. I've  since adopted the same policy regarding women.
"If men are so wrong or inappropriate, let women do all courtship and work in dates. Let them make the first move, let them make conversation interesting, let them work hard to get a man, let them propose and get rejected. Let them teach us the ""right"" way. Men are not acting more inappropriately, they are just slowly starting to NOT ACT at all. Get it through ur thick heads."
Getting you name dragged through the mud because you have a bad date is not changing your behavior is saving your life.
"By changing the way men date, you mean gave up, right?"
I love they interview a woman to describe man's positions.
"Dating has definitely changed.  When I go out women hit on me.  Maybe it‚Äôs because I have a home by the beach.  But I don‚Äôt say that.  I don‚Äôt even take dates to my house.  I take them to a studio apartment I rent month to month.  I don‚Äôt take my nice car either and I won‚Äôt be a simp and take them to nice restaurants.  Maybe they think I‚Äôll pay off their student loans üòÇ Nope to that too.  I‚Äôm free and not going to ruin it.  I retired at 49, home is paid off.  No car payment, no credit cards.  If I want to work I do.  Then I go on vacation a few months."
All these percentages and polls ignore one key point.  How many men change their behavior by not dating women at all?  I didn't see that item addressed in discussion
"Instead of ""CBS"" you should just call yourself ""BS."""
Don't be surprised if the number of babies born this year falls exponentially. #WeAreDone
"I'm 44, and women caused me a lot of stress. I like women but not the hurt and pain behind it. I found I'm more happy when I'm by myself"
"Embrace mgtow , avoid women and live a long happy life"
This is excellent advice for women. Hear that ladies? Wait until at least your mid 30s before you even consider marriage. Because there's nothing that men love more than older women who have had multiple sexual partners. I just can't figure out why marriage rates are at an all time low. Hmmmmmü§î
"'m an employer of my (and another person's) company, and we both specifically avoid hiring women for numerous reasons, one of them being the false accusations of sexual harassments.  Yes, we accept applications from women due to legal reasons, but we haven't hired even one female employee in the 11 years the company ran.  It's just not worth it, unless the female applicant has some really impressive resume (they don't, since high level women don't apply to small companies like mine)."
Women get upset when men approach them but are too scared to approach men. Can you say falling fertility rate? A society with this dysfunction will be out competed by other societies in population growth.
Mgtow!
"'Riding into history'. Yep that pretty much sums it up. They rode everything they could get their hands on, and now getting a commitment is history."
Just got back from the future...... where women of the future absolutely HATE todays women for RUINING it!
"Well congrats feminists

You‚Äôve ended human interaction entirely :)"
"It is a shame that this story did not talk about men who have chosen to be single. In stories on dating, they always seem to leave this statistic out of the conversation and if they do talk about it, they put men down in all negative ways who choose this way of life. And what's also amazing is the lady spoke about Millennials, but never once spoke about the madness that is really going on like them being responsible for the ""hook-up culture"" because of dating apps and the madness that ensues as a result of them. Thank God I am a Gen-Xer and didn't have to go through any of this. And I am also single by choice and I love every single minute of it."
"So You're Asking a woman about man's issues?
Nice 
üòÇüòÇ"
"I did the math on this a few days ago, based on stats avail at Family Law firms dealing in divorce. The pool of actual decent, non-litigeous women, who won‚Äôt divorce you and make you a single-dad---about 10-15%. I only seriously date conservative women with traditional values. Liberal and professional women are avoided wholesale. You‚Äôre independent? Congrats. You‚Äôve successfully taught me that you‚Äôre adept at going it alone. Have a. good life. I can‚Äôt tell you how many women I‚Äôve been hit up on Match who are in their 40s who thought they wanted the kid and career. The result, a kid raised by daycare, and a selfish narcissistic women with no concept of making a real relationship works past the point of when things move out of the honeymoon phase and simply become ‚Äúlife‚Äù. An entire generation, maybe two, has been ruined because of Feminism. These women will openly mock stay-at-home mothers and home-makers."
Now people know why men are going their own way
"Well, it also STOPPED thousands of conversations between men and women."
I refuse to work with a woman. I'm happily married with no need to have interaction. Don't create the opportunity for a false allegation.
Companies should maybe stop hiring woman to safe their male employees from this problem
MGTOW REDPILL PROTECT YOURSELF.
#mgtow brothers
"Yeh, they avoid women."
Why do they keep showing white guys with black women? CBS loves that.
I love my freedom . No need women üëé. Thanks Metoo you liberated us .
"You can either love women or you can understand them, but not both."
"As a rule usually guys have made the first move when approaching, but these days if you so much as look in the direction of a woman who doesn't find you appealing then you are accused of creeping or being a pervert.
You only have to look at Joey Swolls channel to see the number of videos where guys are doing nothing at all getting posted and tagged as creeps.
So of course going forward guys as a way of self preservation are not approaching it's absolutely logical this is happening."
MGTOW IS THE WAY
Marriage today is a trap for a man! Men don‚Äôt do it!! I‚Äôm never getting married again!
The only thing is you have to do is just walk away and don't concern yourself with keep it moving
No dating for me.  üò®
By change their behaviour they mean they are saying FO to dating. I do not want anyone to approach me and my workplace is definitely not changing. Ambitious but without any talent in my experience.
You asked for this ladies you get it.
"Wahmen want your Attention, Time and Money. Yes they see you as an ATM"
How were they acting?
#MeToo has indeed affected how single men behave: By going #MGTOW
"The fact that we're even polling ourselves about courtship shows that there is no rudimentary trust between the sexes, because ettiquette and sensibilty don't exist anymore."
"So basically men change their behavior out of necessity because of women, women most affected."
"The fact is, the last thing this country needs is MORE PEOPLE.   Just think about all the person vs. person stuff that happens EVERY DAY:
- competing for a parking spot
- competing to merge on the freeway
- competing to get hired
- competing to get into a good school
- competing to get into a good major
- competing for promotion


There are TOO MANY FREAKING PEOPLE.  We start getting on each other's nerves when everything is crowded.


So the end of dating, which happened in large part in the past 10 to 15 years, is probably a good thing long term.


Ask yourself this.  Does either gender care too much about being faithful in a relationship?  Of course not.  Very few people in our times do.  Now you can say ""that's bad"" but you have to roll with reality.


Stop pursuing relationships.  Getting married today is like what 'going steady' was, just that easy to end it.  There are NO SOCIAL NORMS to keep people together, and there is NO SOCIAL STIGMA to dumping a significant other just because you felt 'it was time.'


You might think 'that's true but it's bad'  well remember,  you can't change it, it is our society now.
The WORST thing you can do as a man is be a 'wallet' for some girl who just because she has 'maternal instincts' and wants to have children. 



Maternal instincts are not YOUR problem.  They are HER problem, remember that. 



The LAST thing our society needs right now is MORE PEOPLE.   Having sex is normal, expected, healthy but do NOT GET MARRIED and start popping out kids, we don't need them.  Look at all those homeless!   TOO MANY PEOPLE NOW.
.

I find it extremely offensive that they keep showing pixs of a white man and black women as a couple!
No women are worth it to waste so much time and resources to them..!!
I don't remember taking this survey.
2:30 what is in it for marriage for men?
"Why all the downvotes? ....it‚Äôs true. Men are always pressure to ‚Äúmake a move‚Äù on the first few dates. Ok how about women make the first moves..but they don‚Äôt then blame the guy for not making a move etc. women gotta step up if you want equality, start making the moves."
‚ÄúMe too‚Äù movement is definitely high impact on jury decisions on celebrity case this time re-trial compare to the not guilty verdict in this case on 2004.
Free Bill...
"Reason and justice go together a lot better than emotion and justice. This jury was very emotional. The judge allowed a lot of women to testify that Cosby did bad things to them way back when, and that poisoned the well. The ground has been laid for a lucrative civil case against Cosby----and all his accusers and Gloria Allred stand to gain."
So where does the #metoo movement stand in the way Machel Wolf treated Sara Sanders?
Who wait this late to say something
MeToo is useful for helping actual abuse victims. But they also say you've been sexually assaulted because someone looked at you funny. This is not justice and will hurt the MeToo cause.
Of course they couldn't wait to be on camera.....again.
why did the women visit cosby and his friends in the first place. ?????
"So given the fact that one of the victum members is from ""playboy"" that means playboy is a honey trap briggade waiting to happen. FML!"
"I believe he did those things,to most of those women, but it‚Äôs a sad day in the US when someone is convicted of a serious crime without PHYSICAL EVIDENCE."
YES. That old fish-eyed fool. Was found GUILTY!!!!!!!!! Up to 10yrs in jail for each charge. 30yrs.    I bet he won't spend 5yrs. He will sercome to illnesses and be treated at nursing facility or home with a ankle bracelet
Who's laughing Now!!! Bauhahahahah!! Gold diggers!!
Give them credit for their work but don‚Äôt say they inspired a movement. They did not and credit to them for admitting it.
Nice to see Tarana Burke get a shout out for once
"Simplest answer: Tarana Burke. To be fair to Milano though, she never claimed it was her idea."
"Yeah, mhm."
"5:10 ""In 2006, Tarana Burke founded the Me Too movement and began using the phrase ""Me Too"" to raise awareness of the pervasiveness of sexual abuse and assault in society.[2][10] Burke has been supportive of the #MeToo hashtag.

The phrase ""Me Too"" developed into a broader movement following the 2017 use of #MeToo as a hashtag following the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations. In October 2017, actress Alyssa Milano encouraged women to say ""Me Too"" if they've experienced sexual harassment or assault, and the hashtag went viral. Milano quickly acknowledged Burke's earlier use of the phrase on Twitter, writing ""I was just made aware of an earlier #MeToo movement, and the origin story is equal parts heartbreaking and inspiring"".[3][24] Burke has been supportive of the #MeToo hashtag.[3][25]

Time named Burke, among a group of other prominent activist women dubbed ""the silence breakers"", as the Time Person of the Year for 2017.[15] Her speaking engagements have included Brown University in February 2018""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarana_Burke


""And even though Burke‚Äôs been doing this advocacy work for over 10 years, it was Alissa Milano‚Äôs tweets that helped catapult the hashtag into a full-blown movement. While Milano‚Äôs intentions weren‚Äôt to steal away all of Burke‚Äôs tireless and thankless work, her star power managed to shine bright on this awful topic of conversation.

Maybe this is why many Black women feel left out of this movement, because the actual creator of it has been marginalized by the very movement she spawned. Burke told ESSENCE exclusively, ‚ÄúThe world responds to the vulnerability of white women. Our narrative has never been centered in mainstream media. Our stories don‚Äôt get told and as a result, it makes us feel not as valuable.‚Äù
https://www.essence.com/videos/tarana-burke-explains-why-black-women-dont-think-metoo-is-for-them/"
"I do think it‚Äôs a little unfair to say they were protecting them. The people that knew and said nothing probably had the same fear the victims had. Those people had money, power, and influence. When you have bills to pay and moths to feed it can be very scary to charge into a losing battle."
"god, why did you give ad time to opportunists? üòí"
Good history lesson
"Oprah should be all over that!!! 
RIGHT, SHE IS SUCH A RIGHT FIGHTER."
"Hosts, at least google the topic you plan on discussing"
"Meryl Streeps God, I wonder if these two ever praised Saint Meryl the patron saint of enablers."
The most burning question: Is Ryan wearing a wig?
"The #MeToo WITCH HUNTS, that is."
I want to see vice engage with a straight man of color from Compton and ask him what his thoughts are of the white privilege and then find out how much of that is a cultural issue or a generalization of a culture
"Everytime a man speaks about his problems. You hear; ""now imagine what those women have to go through."""
"You had me until a white woman said, ‚ÄúA handful of white men losing their jobs....‚Äù  don‚Äôt bring race into a discussion when it‚Äôs not the issue.  This is about men abusing their positions of power for something sexual in nature.  Stick to the topic, or you‚Äôll cause people like me to think this is really about something.  We need to fight this battle of people abusing their power for sexual.  Don‚Äôt try to end the entire war of social injustice in this one battle."
what an awkward family dinner
A man breathed within a 20 meter radius without my consent. #Metoo
"I think it's terrible that some women are being told that because they were ""only"" sexually harassed and not assaulted that #metoo isn't for them."
"I appreciate the guy on the right offering the conversations he‚Äôs had with other men who know they‚Äôve done something bad to another person and are worried for themselves. 
Because they know. They know what they did.

I think we need to hear from the men. The men who know what they did. If they can come forward and admit it without repercussions and apologize like that one guy did on Twitter, we can maybe have a conversation on how prevalent this is and address the reasons why this happens with men who are otherwise good people."
Down vote
all of this can be proven in a court of law of course...
"I like this conversation. This is a people issue, not a women's issue specifically. It affects more women in the sense of surviving some negative experience or whatever, but it's a people issue and I feel they addressed that pretty well."
VICE groped me at a job interview 10 years ago when i was a young impressionable high school student :'(
O.K. So what was the point of this whole conversation ? I'm confused üôÑ
'Echo chamber' the movie.
Segregate the workplace.
Yeah if I getting into the hiring room all five would say is the boss going to hire that brown guy.
Eat first. Then record discussion.
To add to my last comment this I‚Äôm just trying to poke at the fact that vice likes to imply that white privilege is a inevitability at birth when they haven‚Äôt looked at the cultural differences in the way that colored men and white men grow up on a mass scale I‚Äôm not trying to generalize colored men as one thing in whatever you want that to be in your own eyes or as all white men as a general thing because there are outliers on both sides but all I‚Äôm saying is vice needs to look into the differences in decisions that both cultures make and not just say white privilege every time they want to make a argument on why there are outraged men who happen to be white.
8:50 i mean this is a good answer and I like this the most :D
Our local judge drives drunk is that bad ?
That blonde chicks a dude who's metooing that lol
There is one simple solution for all of this literally... just don't hire attractive women or girls. No matter what they will find a way to get the man / mentor in trouble. There are a lot of young guys who would be super appreciative of the same mentor-ship and will not accuse the guy and ruin his reputation and life. I'm just saying seems like a pretty logical and easy fix to me.
"sexual predation is obviously a behavioral issue based on false and harmful belief patterns. It is a fault in the way we think about and perceive what is sexually healthy and appropriate, and how to respect our own and others bodies. Much sexual abuse today also relates to how men see women; many times as objects rather than people sadly.. they do not regard us the same level of humanity and depth of experiance as them.. when we are seen as more different than similar there is room for one to treat another as sub human."
this video is racist against men and its offending me stop it
Such an awkward format
"Guys that go to lawschool are attractive, mostly for the money they make."
"this is worse than water boarding, if you made gitmo inmates watch this video it would be considered a war crime."
Thank you all for this roundtable. I really appreciate the men saying what they did and opening up.
The alt right cockgobblers are already here.
Eating dinner while debating? Are you fucking kidding me? What kind of a joke is this? VICE is sinking even lower than I assumed was possible. LMFAO
That's a lot of soy on the table..
There so scared to offend them Jesus stand up for urself y'all got no spine
look how i eat and judge people. so sofistyke
Dont hire women. Wow.
30 years ago one summer I can't remember at who's house or in which town it was in but vice definitely sexually assaulted me in a room at a house party allegedly
#MeToo = üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©
There are zero men in this entire clip...
#MeToo wants some food
So all of this food is going to go to waste... meanwhile in a third world country... we should have a metoo movement for hungry people
Whats up with this thumbs up and down disparity?
it seems 2 out of the 5 are lying... Is this a common theme?
"When I contacted a law firm in December to see about the possibility of a suit against a medical firm for mal pratice,i requested only men to talk with ,i tried to explain that this was personal and with my age,the climate at the time,and just not trusting professional women at the time,i though my request was not out of line. Of course the women in the firm felt this was an insult to them. WTF am I supposed to to. I am near 60,i grew up in a different age. I did not want some lawyer aquise me of anything. Right now most of my friends see this as a power grab. To bad. This should have done this differently."
Vice convinced me that da jewz should give Isreal back to Palestine
Getting in trouble for keeping distance from women is Far better than getting in trouble for sexual harassment
"I rather not be in the 2%,so don't fault me being extra careful."
#metoo has been the greatest recruiting tool for MGTOW.
One of the craziest ways to have your life ruined is by having a female colleague show interest in you and then you decline out of being professional. They really don't take rejection well.
I love how the misandrist just lets her toxic femininity breathe. Men getting falsely accused of sexual assault are literally by all over the place. But hey it's so small and negligible meaning it doesn't exist whatsoever.
Let's say there were a bowl of M&Ms and I told you that only 2% were poisoned. Would you eat any?
"their empathy for what amounts to mental health issue for the men is amazing. Men feeling stressed, and fear in the work place, and they could not care less. overwhelming number of workplace suicide are men, and their advice is just get over it."
Feminists have proven they can be dentrimental to men‚Äôs jobs and well being.
"It's not about false accusations. It's about ""he flirted with me once now i will ruin his life""."
"So the 2% is supposed to mean, ""Don't worry - if you're accused, there's a 98% chance you're guilty and your career is over."" We should all feel better now."
"Well she failed to mention that sexual harassments claims are almost always entirely  based on testimony.  Meaning that regardless of guilt, the accusation is more than enough to result in dire life ruining consequences for the accused.  Funny this lady precludes that fact from her argument.  Thus, mens refusal to be alone with women under any circumstances is a very rational and pragmatic response to the current situation."
If a man is in a room with a woman for a few hours working and afterwards she accuses you of harassment let's say because of a misunderstanding or her lying the guy is done for. He did nothing but just the accusation will destroy him
2%?!    GTFOH
"Never take advice from a woman about how to act around other women. 
Just avoid them all."
To claim 2% is an outright lie. Sexual harassment is the one crime where the accuser is also judge and jury.
"My chances of dying in a car crash are less than .02%, but I still wear a seat belt."
If your in the 2% innocent collom it can destroy your life so yeah it's not as easy as it sounds.
I love how feminists sit there and claim that they are trying to help everyone when all of the policy they create so clearly favors women.
Save yourself. Play it safe and don't even tempt fate by being alone with a woman you work with.
"Wow, men are afraid of being falsely accused and you people say they are panicking, should learn how to behave and that they are committing a crime.
Jesus, what a way to make things worse."
Your statistics are extremely questionable.
"You can't force male managers to mentor female employees  and it isn't discrimination to use the mike pence rule
God bless Mike pence and Billy Graham"
2% naaaaa more 99.9 % when shes in her period of false accusation
According to these two it's once again Men's fault. Way to go blaming men for every problem.
"my brother who works in a small IT company in NC told me he is having trouble finding a gf, so I told why not ask one of your coworkers out, and he told me he would never do that because one of his male coworkers asked a female coworker out, she causally told him that she is not interested and he replied ok and never talked about that again, a week later he receives a mail from hr that he is being fired for making sexual advances at workplace... ofcourse men are terrified of women, that guy drives for doordash now as he was unable to find work anywhere else"
"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice  ...."
2% is just the ones where the guy could prove his innocence. What about the false accusations where the man couldn‚Äôt prove his innocence? It‚Äôs definitely higher than 2%.
"I'm an employer of my (and another person's) company, and we both specifically avoid hiring women for numerous reasons, one of them being the false accusations of sexual harassments.  Yes, we accept applications from women due to legal reasons, but we haven't hired even one female employee in the 11 years the company ran.  It's just not worth it, unless the female applicant has some really impressive resume (they don't, since high level women don't apply to small companies like mine)."
"Most men wouldn‚Äôt even speak to a woman at work, let alone ask them out. I‚Äôd rather be single and keep my job than get #MeToo‚Äôd."
The problem with citing FBI data is that it keeps track of accusations which go through the legal system. They aren't keeping track of false statements in HR complaints.
I have a bowl with 100 skittles. 2 are poisoned. Would you eat the whole bowl? Nope. Not a chance.
"Love the shaming language Wymyn insist on using. Man ""scared"". No actually Men are SMART for avoiding them."
Mgtow shield wall is up
"That woman just lied.  False Sexual assault claims may be at 2%,;  but sexual assault and sexual harassment are not the same thing.  Women claim ANYTHING as harassment..."
Why do Women need to be mentored by Men Where are the feminists
Notice that they are not citing any law against refusing to be friendly to women colleagues?
That's the proof that woman really think that nothing is ever their fault ü§£
"suing a man for rapr after 5+years should not br allowed if the ""victim"" was an ADULT when it happened."
I want a law that gives men the right to wear a body cam at work or to force employers to install video and audio recordin equipment in every work space except the bathroom obviously.
"Keep them away from me.

#NOTME"
Men are afraid that they are going to be falsely accused of inappropriate behavior after women falsely accuse men of inappropriate behavior? I'm SHOCKED! SHOCKED I say!
"This video is beyond stupid. They completely missed the mark here. Good job guys! 
üòÇüëèüëèüëèüòê
Just wow."
Feminists the greatest recruiting tool for MGTOW.
"As an outsider and having seen how the FBI at work the past four years.  I would only trust them to give me the correct time, twice a day, with a broken clock!"
"It‚Äôs the fact that man don‚Äôt want their behavior to be taken as flirting or harassment simply by talking to you how they would talk to any other friend, it seems like a lot of women especially in todays society feel men are always trying to ‚Äúget with them‚Äù but that‚Äôs not always the case. Also if something was to happen and she falsely accused you it‚Äôs her word against yours and NOBODY is believing what you say over a women especially now so men just avoid interaction altogether."
"Okay, say I'm a man, now you are telling me that almost all accusations of sexual impropriety against men are true (98%)
So I should have no reason to worry about interacting with women, after all, why would any woman want to hurt me?
This is truly chilling."
So the best solution is have companies with only females and companies with only males and let see which company can last more than 1 week
The point is that 2% of false allegations is very high. You do not want to be the one guy that has to deal with the 50th woman that has the power to destroy your life. You‚Äôll be guilty until you can prove to be innocent. You cannot defend yourself and be fired. Stay safe. Never have meetings with only one woman. Always have witnesses.
"Sure, I trust the FBI, just about as much as I trust NBC.........so long."
Male managers should not have 1-1s with women PERIOD.
"wow... just wow...
people are worried. and we should blame them for being worried eh?"
Men keep protecting your self.  Cameras / witnesses
"You're very hungry and handed a bag of 50 peanuts but told there is one peanut in there (2%) that has a neurotoxin which can make you violently ill or leave you paralyzed - are you going take a chance and eat some? Not likely.  That's what men face with interacting with women in the work place - it's not about being "" afraid "" it's about taking sensible precautions to safeguard their jobs and reputation."
"I just don't want to be in the 2% , is that too hard to accept?"
2% its really 90%
It is their choices whether men will mentor women or not. You can't say that this is crime or violation. All women betray men when their needs are fulfilled by men like mentoring.
2:02 - men are even get punished now for being afraid. This woman is insane.
"Can someone explain why so many people disliked this?

Edit: Maybe because these people are undermining the power of women who can easily use this power to blackmail men or ruin their life?"
Nope! We are tired of being accused and having lives ruined over baseless accusations.
This is completely not true because as a 15 year old I was accused and it broke my world and how I saw it and as a male this is one of the many things why I have trust issues at a young age.
One false accusation is one false accusation too many.
Has to be higher than 2% false claims - I know several and they were all false
If you are a woman or a man who wants a relationship with somebody from work you already know instead of dating strangers you don't know you are out of luck because trying in even the vaguest of ways is prohibited.
she is more threatening calling out laws and forbidding men to say no...
I think that 2% statistic is bull
"How's this fair, women basically pointing a weapon to men's head do whatever I say and when we try to avoid you, you try to get us in trouble pulling us into your issues.
Lose lose situation how is that fair?"
"Tell me, cultural historian Lynn Parramore or company leader Gene Marks, or anyone else who made the claims in this video: If I, as a man, lose my job and my ability to get future jobs because my reputation is shot by a false report of sexual harassment - one which *will* destroy my reputation, for sure - will you be able to offer me a job? Or support me through any legal trial that takes place, at least monetarily? Work to help clear me of such false accusations? Or will you just wash your hands and say, ""F it, he's just one of the 2% who got nicked and let the courts decide if he's guilty""?

Heck, do you even walk the talk you make? Because, beyond the facts and figures, our lives are on the line here."
so fear is illegal now? we know that any accusation will be unconditionally believed and your life will be destroyed.
"for the sake of argument, even if there are only 2% false allegations, that 1 in 50 chance will nuke a guy's career and forever smear his reputation. you would never jump out of an airplane if there was a 1 in 50 possibility the parachute would not open."
A simple gaze can make her 'uncomfortable'....and make you lose your job
She said only 2% - the fear is being in that 2%
"(Sigh) Being lectured again!!? Ladies, this is what you wanted, you caused the damage, can't change your minds now. Oh, and by the way, 2% false accusations is way off, the number of false accusations is much much higher. Also, notice the subtle threat of it being ""illegal"" to avoid women in the workplace. Gawd!! They just won't stop!!"
I'm not afraid to work with women because Im unprofessional. I am afraid because the accusation is all it takes.
"A false accusation doesn't need to be taken to court have you ever dealt with a crazy ex? You all talking nonsense.  

They aren't refusing because they are women, they are refusing because of potential lawsuits even when innocent."
"Ok. I've been hearing alot about the work environment. But what I haven't heard about is the damage in every other area of life. And I have only heard about ""white males in power."" But what about your average middle class men who do have moral compasses who have been taught to respect women but they fear that one mistake and they'll be stripped of everything? You can't be so laser focused on a crusade that you don't pay attention to who gets hurt in the process. And don't even get me started on the dilemmas that BLACK men face. Me Too has done many good, and I support women demanding to be put on the same platform. But the the movement has single-categorized everybody. There is a difference between those that feel they're entitled, invincible, & untouchable and those that are human beings and have errors. They shouldn't suffer. We can't overlook the damages that Me Too caused."
"My employer refuses to hire female employees.
I love working in this environment"
"Did all men hear that? Its illegal to avoid women. Any tickets left for flight to Mars, I'm going home."
mgtow around the world is holding the line
It‚Äôs not backlash it‚Äôs self preservation ya women did it to yourselves.
"I don't think men and women are made to work together. Traditionally, men worked with men and vice versa. Go to the oilfield and it's all men and there are never many issues. As a maintenance technician at a hotel, I found that the dynamic with so many women around became a problem for me with advances, drama and jealousy. This led me to seek jobs far away from an office. I prefer working with men only or solo as the drama is almost nothing. No need to tip toe around people's insecurities or feelings in those environments. Risk of getting into legal trouble is almost nothing as well."
"Know what else is illegal? Making a false accusation. Didn't stop these harridans, now did it?"
"Interact with women in your workplaces only when needed. Otherwise you're better off avoiding them. After work, don't even think about hanging out. If you need to work late, make sure a camera is recording. You'll thank me later."
"I know this will happen, all men should be respectful and careful."
"Nate Parker of ""Birth of a nation"" was a man that was vindicated 15 years before the movie came out. He was found not guilty and proven innocent. So interesting that that case was brought up right before the release of birth of a nation just as his career was jump starting. They wanted him to apologize or have sympathy for the victim that falsely accused him. He did not have to show remorse for something that was traumatizing for him and almost destroyed him. The end result? He no longer in Hollywood. No studio will touch him. Stay away from women in the work place."
"Anyone who doesn't take steps to mitigate risk is just asking for trouble. If you let your guard down and make any sort of a comment  outside the strict bounds of work related topics it will come back to harm you eventually. Women hold grudges, they look for lapses, they look for anything that might serve as a weapon they can use maybe not today but when it works to their best advantage.  Do not take a meeting one on one with a woman. Never close the door when meeting with a woman. Never travel with a woman. Never dine alone with a woman. Dating is dating and work is work. Never confuse the two or assume that a woman can be trusted not to screw you over if it advances her interests. Personal experience talking here."
"""There is a clear line"" proceeds not to talk about where this line is precisley. And  feminist won't ever define it because that would mean there would be gender roles."
The Bret Cavanaugh case minimized the #metoo movement!
How is this video still up on YouTube and not been deleted
"Organization isn't going to help men, when someone falsely accused..."
"‚ÄúBreaking the law.‚Äù?

Seriously, GFY."
"5 years ago in my early 20s I would have loved to hire women. 

Now in my late 20s I would never. Never. Ain‚Äôt that funny?"
Anytime there's music in the background..........you know you're being lied to
"2% of false r*pe accusations is already too much . a friend of mine got falsely accused of that years ago. it has traumatized him to this day . i don't like the way this woman is downplaying it , not to mention the veiled threat against already anxious people that they may face the law . my advice , when you start your company , pick in advance your entire staff , this way you cannot be blackmailed to hire anyone you don't want to hire /"
2% of false accusations does not look that bad until you fall in that category
Is fear a punishable offence?
"Don't marry them, don't hire them, don't work with them. Protect yourself"
Yeah lady?  What about mens safety at the workplace?
Nice try with this trap. Not buying this. Men stay on point and don't give in. Stay away from the women in the work place. Don't even look at them.
"21000 views, 118 likes, now you know the dislike count. And by the way 2% of 1 billion is 20 million."
2%? ..... Make that 98% False accusations
Tarana Burke articulates the problem so clearly. Good interview.
"In tears, this childs story breaks my heart."
Well said Tarana Burke
"Tarana---I have long held the belief that unless and until MEN CONFRONT OTHER MEN BEHAVING BADLY---this dynamic won't really change.  When they see it, confront the man directly....don't be afraid.  STAND UP FOR WOMEN.  Only then do you deserve to feel righteous."
Thank you!
Absolutely shocking ‚òπ
Tarana Burke is so good ! An American hero!
Question: The parents of the girls never questioned why they were getting $300 for visiting some older man?
He‚Äôs an accomplice.....this is easy work fire his a$$!
"Jennifer it is not your fault that you didn't report him.  You were groomed, manipulated, violated, assaulted. Trauma like that impacts a person on so many complex levels, including overwhelming fear and shame that is like a prison. 
It is not your fault. 
It is not your fault. 
None of this is your fault."
Where were the parents?
He is still alive
"I think it's time for Mr. Epstein to meet ""Big Bubba."""
"If you research the recruiters you‚Äôll see that ‚ÄúFlyGirl‚Äù pulled all of her social media except for YouTube. I got a feeling that one of these recruiters made a deal. They probably finally got caught and made a deal to turn evidence.The dominos are gonna fall. Feel so sorry for these young girls who were molested, they need so much love and support. Now is the time for the good guys to step up and protect these children."
I will never try and convict any man based on an interview. Take me to a court and let the factual evidence decide one way or the other.
Who was recruiting these young girls for Epstein?

"‚Äú‚ÄòYou were the seal of perfection,
    full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
13 
You were in Eden,
    the garden of God;
every precious stone adorned you:
    carnelian, chrysolite and emerald,
    topaz, onyx and jasper,
    lapis lazuli, turquoise and beryl.[a]
Your settings and mountings[b] were made of gold;
    on the day you were created they were prepared.
14 
You were anointed as a guardian cherub,
    for so I ordained you.
You were on the holy mount of God;
    you walked among the fiery stones.
15 
You were blameless in your ways
    from the day you were created
    till wickedness was found in you.
16 
Through your widespread trade
    you were filled with violence,
    and you sinned.
So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God,
    and I expelled you, guardian cherub,
    from among the fiery stones.
17 
Your heart became proud
    on account of your beauty,
and you corrupted your wisdom
    because of your splendor.
So I threw you to the earth;
    I made a spectacle of you before kings.
18 
By your many sins and dishonest trade
    you have desecrated your sanctuaries.
So I made a fire come out from you,
    and it consumed you,
and I reduced you to ashes on the ground
    in the sight of all who were watching."
And where are  the parents where a 14 year old girl can have enough time to visit someones house without parents looking for her

quel bilan un an apr√®s ?  parole lib√©r√©e mais libert√© d'expression restreinte et d√©mocratie mise √† mal
I‚Äôm sorry but he‚Äôs right. A lot of men are now wary of being involved with women in the workplace especially.
he told the truth and sometimes people don't wanna hear the truth
"He is absolutely right. 
I have friends with businesses that think the same way.
Why? Because women have become a financial liability for companies..."
"Probably the most positive person in th USA and they pull this shit on him. He explained himself very well in the video. Victimhood is not the answer. The shame is yours. You have dig deep to see the issues and bring yourself to overcome them but they are yours. Identifying the abuser is only a very small first step in healing. And money won't help you heal caliber - it will likely make it worse. Heal-up, get on the horse, and ride again!"
"Robbins was right, despite the apology. I'll always make sure never to be alone with a woman in an office anymore, now that I know I can have my life wrecked 20 years after on a simple allegation."
People actually blew Tony Robbin's comments/actions out of proportion - the highlights of the incident do him no justice.  He pushed the lady in the video as an example to demonstrate a point not because he was trying to enforce his will.  His comments come from a good place.
He is not wrong though
My problem with the #metoo movement is that it is sexist in nature. Both women and men can be sexually abusive.
I mean as a woman it wasn't cool what he said but it's the truthüòê
His right you know
"Here we go again, if you dont agree with these people they attack you. Everyone wants to be a victim. SMH"
If you don't try to understand what's he is saying you run the risk of missing the whole scary picture
"If he was a victim, he has the right to an opinion, enough said"
It's terrible how some people can say something wrong by mistake and get so hated for it. Can't even talk anymore. What in the world are we doing to each other?
A movement that can not take light criticism is moving in the wrong direction.
He's only saying sorry because people got offended by his remarks but he was saying the truth & the truth hurts.
he is RIGHT
"I understand Tarana, but he's right.  They are both right."
"Never apologize, It'll never be good enough."
"Of course he's sorry and wants to get connected with the women of the Me Too movement. Any other response would cost him profit in his business of motivating others. He's a businessman, plain and simple. His bottom line is the almighty dollar."
How is that offensive?  Tony Robbins is a genuinely nice person. Everyone is making it so you can't say anything without offending someone. Absolutely ridiculous. He shouldn't have to apologize. He will because he's nice and never intended to hurt anyone.
"If a man is uncomfortable hiring an attractive female, he is the one with the problem, not her.  Victim blaming 101"
Tony is just saying the truth
He‚Äôs right but it doesn‚Äôt matter if you say anything that doesn‚Äôt support me2 100% that will try to ruin your career
'Me too' is malevolent.
His contribution to our world reaches far beyond what you can see in this short news clip. If you do not know who Tony Robbins is I encourage you to learn more about him before jumping to conclusions.
He‚Äôs right
good for him
"Always someone going to mess things up for someone who helps thousands of people! He's just telling the truth! This country can't handle that anymore or? Some of you woman wanted to be treated the same well here you go!!!! How about ""COMMON SENSE MOVEMENT"" or isn't there any left?"
"He‚Äôs. One. Hundred. Percent. On. Point. 

Eff metoo. It‚Äôs only hurting women and is just a ploy by women who want their five minutes of fame. Gtfo."
Why not encourage ppl to hire both men and women and encourage employers and employees to keep their hands and nasty comments to themselves and dont make false accusations so that they won't have any problems in the work place!!!! His apology comes after he realized his mouth could cost him money!!!!!!!!!!!ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î
I thought the #metoo was a meme.     :/
Tony Baloney
"I heard the same thing, men are now afraid to hire women.  For the first time, since I was a young kid in the 1960's, I am starting to see all male office environments again.  Not a woman in sight.  No problems, no drama, and no lawsuits."
#himtoo stop objectifying him!
I am a woman and I find nothing wrong with empowering women not to label themselves as victims and live life as a victim
Why apologise for being against victim mentality
Let's bully him for saying the truth....
Robbins should not apologize for telling the truth .no one wants to hire women.why would you gave how week
That's why I don't get hired sometimes. Female bosses are too attracted to me ;)
Listening to his comments I don't think he was against the me-too movement I think he's against those who utilize movements like this to lie cheat and steal which cheapens the movement for those who are actually Overcomers from traumatic events.
"One time a girl ""accidentally"" touched my finger. I am a survivor üò§üí™üèº"
i stand with him
He was right though. This is like apologising for the crying baby.
"Isn't what Tony Robbins is saying yet another way to shut women up?  Shame them for coming forward? Telling them if they continue they will not get job offers from male employers because ""they"" are afraid of women.  This is the same attitude I've heard for the past 50 years.  Tony you are off base."
"He is absolutely right. 
Me too bullshit mouvement made it very dangerous to hire women with all the false accusations and so on. 
Women brought this upon themselves."
"I‚Äôm not for or against tony.  It seems to me he is saying victimhood will get you nowhere (i agree with that), but then he is also saying if you fight they will just fight back (this is what the demonstration with the lady was meant to prove), so is there no point reporting anything according to Tony?  He also said ‚Äòhe without sin cast the first stone‚Äô.  Just because you‚Äôre not prefect doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt stand up for right and wrong and justice. That isn‚Äôt the meaning of ‚Äòhe without sin‚Äô.  It means don‚Äôt judge someone‚Äôs moral failure, but applies to consenting adults.  The metoo movement was about non-consensual behaviour."
The only reason Tarna (whatever the hell her name was) is because women can't have their lives ruined by false allegations
He's still alive?
"He did not say anything wrong to her, she misunderstood him"
wtf he's right abc take this L he's right
He has nothing to apologize for.
I FORGIVE HIMüôè‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ
Tony saved thousands of women from sex trafficking this year alone... did you mention that?
if you have to go find outrage like a heat seeking missile so you can feel better about yourself ... then you got bigger problem than abuse.
dont care love always!!  Tony rocks
"""I'm not knocking the Me Too movement. I'm knocking victimhood"". So you go to a self help seminar then complain when you're challenged for having a victim mindset? Robbins whole program is based on creating your OWN happiness. Personal accountability and I don't mean that in the sense of blaming yourself if you went through a tragic experience, but owning up to your life and the hand that's been dealt to get through that experience. You are responsible for your own happiness."
"Fu-- his excuses and apologies...he made profoundly unenlightened HARMFUL comments and as a "" non victim"" he will have to take his lumps..SUCK IT UP!!!"
I don't like this guy but he was right that Metoo is a culture of victimhood.  What hes said since has been complete bullshit aimed at not losing followers.
Be more professional sometimes you need to pick and choose your words to get your point across and someone that's been abused he should have been more selective of his words he should know better
Yuk
#YouToo Tony
Tony was right stop hating on Tony !!!!
So what was the big deal?
"I am a women and I am not part of the me too movement.  He is so right and women need to get a grip on things.  You are distancing yourself from men and other women.  First of all I would agree that you should be respected by men - that first comes from respecting yourself.  Not the say that all women are responsible for what happens to them....but it you act and dress like a slut you will be treated like one.  Yes, I have friends that have been raped.  And yes there are horrible men that take advantage of women....but come on....some of you need to take a little responsibility.   First I would say to stop idolizing the celebrities that have the demonic symbols in there concerts.  If they are controlled by demons why would you want to be like them?"
Tony is no ones fu*king GURU!
"Cannot say I disagree with what he said if one realizes being a victim isn't healthy whereas being a survivor is empowering.  Tony Robbins is in the empowering business not the pity part victim movement!   

And men as well as women get harassed and assaulted so lets stop making the #MeToo gender specific.  And unlike many people who misspeak at least Tony Robbins apologized!!"
"It's about our humanity, fellas."
Opinions expressed fail
Tony's an aggressive sob..landshark con guy
This is the problem there are so much people getting offended by something so small mostly women that just give them another reason not to hire you. You can't even listen to something without getting people offended. What makes you think you will get a job by complaining and that's why you things will stay the same because that's all women do ( not all ) I have to put that so people don't get offended anyways they complainin and wonder why they are in the same place maybe if you look at what your trying to get equality you should see what we are doing because you are busy worrying about what other people think will guess what that's the difference we don't care what you guys are doing well just get shit done. But it's getting harder not to care because you are dragging all your problems to us like it's our fault.
"Life, doesn't end when we die from this physical plane, what happens is our physical eyes eyes close, and our spirit eyes open; now, if during your physical life you believed in God and called upon the name of Jesus, when you leave this physical world your souls will go straight to Jesus, where you will enter into the kingdom of heaven to live forevermore. However, if you didn't believe in God nor call upon the name of Jesus, when those people die their spirit eyes will open into a world of condemnation, and they will be judged and will suffer the finale of spirit death; choose life! Follow no man or guru, swamis not preaching directly from the Holy Bible and following God and Jesus, also read that book yourself."
#It‚Äôsoktobewhitetoo
True üò¢
Who in their right mind would pay and listen to a person telling them nothing?
"The deciding factor is not whether or not to hire an attractive woman!  You hire the person most qualified and if it's the woman,  make sure your male employees know how wrong sexual harrassment is! Make sure they know the repercussions of making any woman uncomfortable! Make sure the males know that sexual harrassment/assault/misconduct will not be tolerated whatsoever!! What the heck is this childish behavior about it's better to not hire women at all?!  GTFOH thats a damn sorry excuse for not wanting to do the right thing!"
He's a fake! He bullied that girl. A sham.
#MeFirstNotMeToo
#bowdown
Good news!!!
Oof
Tony Robbins is about money and nothing else.
True story!!
Boo fucking hoo.

He's right.
He is right
"I‚Äôd vote for Rose McGowan as Republican or Independent. I agree with her on many things, but their are definitely a few things that I‚Äôd want to hear her fews on before voting. Still I hope she does. I think a lot of people would agree.üå∫üôèüèºüíï"
Don‚Äôt ever give into bartering with your body ! But some find it easy going ? Today there‚Äôs no reason for any victims not to record this abuse! Be strong enough to walk out !
"""I think MEN should feel safe figuring out if they did something wrong"". It's about man hating not sexual harassment. She only attacks men and now they can't hide the fact that women do it too."
Everything changed from the me too movement. I have changed. Many people are seeing clearer and waking up to systemic sexism existing. It was a huge catalyst and the affects of it cannot be measured. Change cannot happen overnight.
"Any reporting on Keith Ellison? poundmetoo, er, I mean, hashtagmetoo."
right now is about justice and truth and how we treat humans. who will be TRUTH HERO about this that care about JUSTICE and humanlity this side will be the GOOD guys side this good people side where are you u need to stand up
"YES! me too smashed Hollywood the workplace trust, and the flirting.

"The me-too movement is ridiculous.¬† Of course we all condemn rape, but eliminating rape is not what the me-too movement is about.¬† The me-too movement, very much like the safe space, trigger warning politically correct movements, conflates something as serious as rape with every single gesture men make toward women that might have the slightest hint of sexuality.¬† Not only is that stupid, it smacks of power hunger and the same kind of deranged thinking that has produced the fantasy that there are as many as 135 distinct genders.¬† These are crazy people, the whole lot of them."

"Lol, David's follow up questions are the best, and most callers blank out and just can't answer"
"I love how this guy totally crumples when simply asked to back up his claim.  David was really if anything a little too gentle with his pushback, and the guy couldn't even handle that.  I hope he reconsiders his position."
"If he didn‚Äôt want David to say a word, he should have left a voicemail, and then he‚Äôd not have been challenged. It seems that that‚Äôs how he‚Äôd prefer to be treated. Just a tip for ‚Äútotal control,‚Äù for the next narrative he‚Äôs ‚Äúcrafting.‚Äù"
What even was that? The guy didn't have any examples of his claims. It just seemed like he had a problem with the me too movement and needed to vent about that and used the excuse of women candidates not doing well in the polls to do so.
Sounds like someone doesn't like the idea of women being able to tell on their abusers and those abusers having to face consequences. He wants TOTAL CONTROL over the narative.
The guy thinks successful men should get away with abusing women..
David was asking for the literal name of someone who was unjustly affected by the me too movement while the caller thought he was asking for an example of an aspect of the movement that he disagrees with. This guy had to be kind of drunk to misunderstand a direct question so clear and simple.
Lol he‚Äôs just mad cause he got called out for harassing some girl
This totally guy seems like a manipulative creep
"Wait - - the caller thinks David ""isn't happy"" with ""the narrative"" that the caller ""crafted""? 

I don't know how anybody could be happy with whatever that bizarre narrative was, and which the caller himself was clearly not able to explain..."
Total control has some serious mommy problems.
totalcontrol871 sounds like he resents not having it any longer
Total Control does not like being questioned on his view.
"An beautiful advise to caller: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been hearing a lot of bad shit, frankly, and in many cases it‚Äôs like, wow, I‚Äôve known some of these women and I‚Äôve known stories like this for years and they said nothing to me. What is wrong with me? What have I, how have I presented myself in such a way as to not give confidence, or why was I not the sort of person people would see as a natural ally here? So I started looking at that.‚Äù Anthony Bourdain."
"Speaking as a woman, my (guess) at what ""Total"" was trying to say, is that this movement, as with anything else, should be taken on a case-by-case basis.  Many of these things have happened to many girls and women.  Also, and unfortunately, there are some women who were (not) victimized,  who will lie, and get money and/or revenge on exes, etc.  Sadly, those women only complicate things for true victims of all manners of harassment.

I could be wrong about the caller's point, however.

Let's not blame victims for speaking up!  Many victims have (rightfully) been afraid of retaliation.  

I'm glad the silence is broken."

He DIDNT have any examples, he just feels threatened"
"I can name two instances where ""me too"" seemed (from an outside perspective) to ensnare two men where the repercussions seemed to far outweigh the allegation of misconduct: Senator Al Franken and Garrison Keeler from Lake Wobegon program.  In my mind they both seem to unfairly maligned and caught up in the fervor of a cultural moment. I think Garrison Keillor had his hand on a woman's back during a photograph, and from my outside perspective, Al Franken's photographic prank was when he was a comedian many years earlier and did not warrant his resignation from the Senate in which he was highly regarded by all of his female staff (according to accounts). But, me too represents a cultural shift and anytime there is a cultural shift, there's going to be some backlash. And it is that backlash which may be hurting some high profile female politicians as a result in the short-term."
"How does someone call in like that and make a blanket statement they can‚Äôt defend. Al Franken, Louis CK. There are examples where ‚Äúme too‚Äù crucified people for simply bad behavior"
"The caller is the equivalent of an ""I'm not racist but......"" person. Perfect example of a rise in equity turning some men off."
That dude has control and anger issues coming out the wazoo.
"Women need to believe that they do not deserve harrassment and abuse. For too long we have brushed our feelings and fear aside because we felt we had to. We still face an uphill battle in many areas. I work a Management position. I am expected to dress the same as my Male counterparts but also do my hair and wear makeup. I have to literally dress like a Man, why wear makeup? I have faced workplace discrimination but never spoke up because I didn't want to be ""that Woman"". Me too opened a dialogue and hopefully will make Men think twice before they act inappropriately. I have never asked for special treatment. Only the opportunity to do my job well and be noticed for my hard work. No favors, no quid pro quo."

"This guy is right, women got carried away with the power they got from ruining men‚Äôs lives based on false accusations. You can only tell so many lies before utterly destroying your representation."

There just happens to be a new claim from a Dem staffer on the morning Time magazine revealed it's person of the year was the women of the ""Me Too"" movement. Then Gillibrand and Harris just happen to have statements ready to call for Franken's resignation. It was all way too contrived."
What the fuck was that? These are the type of people that have the right to vote on a president. Smh..

""WELL OBVIOUSLY YOU JUST DON'T LIKE MY CLAIM SO I'LL MOVE ON IT'S OK YOU'RE JUST NOT THINKING"""
Pakman is the best at handling these types of people
Me Too is the new McCarthyism.  Look at the Vic Mignogna situation. #Istandwithvic
This made zero sense
"David, in the future, would you ever consider running for president?"
"I love how when David tries to truncate his claim to something more specific that makes sense, the caller hits him with ‚ÄúweLL yOU JuSt DoN‚ÄôT LiKe tHiS nArRative!‚Äù, implying David is being dodgy or somethingü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Okay I feel like nobody was actually listening to his argument. He's actually pretty correct here. A large portion of insecure male voters have been wronged in their personal lives and are more afraid than is probably justified. There are far fewer cases of public rape and sexual assault allegations proven false than there are those confirmed or unconfirmed, but it is quite palpable seeing innocent men lose their jobs and credibility because of a consensual drunken night out with women they couldn't trust.

Overall, I think it doesn't impact my voting habits one bit. I would not vote for a candidate based on identity, but much of the country is a lot more tribal than that. They would definitely project valid fears in their personal lives into insecure and unjustifiable fears about voting for a woman.

And David was being intentionally stubborn in his manner of speaking with this man, probably pressed for time, but there are many cases of known male public figures like Al Franken or Aziz Ansari, or even drummed up allegations like Louis C.K. which resulted in flooring people's livelihood and respect based on private issues where less wrong was done than was portrayed.

The fear is valid and shouldn't be dismissed. SOME activists and women in the Twitter mob have definitely hurt their cause, and no, that does not validate not voting for Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris on the basis of sex.

Alright done with my ramble."
This is what happens when you wake up with Sam Harris and watch Dave Rubin discuss high level ideas.

When you realize what kind of person you're talking to 2:56. Lol what a genius this guy is.
I'm glad this guy is the authority on how to wield power...
"To all the people in the comments here, what the caller is talking about is the fact that women have in more recent times been falsely accusing men for rape, sexual harassment, and sexual misconduct while getting away with it. For so long, we generally have viewed women as these poor innocent creatures that can't do no wrong and that men are generally the bad people. I myself believed that and I'm a man. However, after having a former friend of mine turn on me and accused me of being too pushy on her, even though she one night snuck on to me and took a picture of herself laying on top of me without my concent , I've had a different view on these cases of rape that pop up now. Now, after witnessing how a woman can turn on me in the blink of an eye, leaving me confused about what I've done, and then lie about it to others, I no longer can fully belive these women when they make these claims. One thing we seem to not understand is that women can be just as manipulative as men to get their way. In fact, it's arguably easier for them since women for the most part are more emotional then men. At least, I know from my experience that that's the case. I as a man don't have a lot of emotions. Hell, it's very hard for me to cry. I didn't even cry when my grandparents died.

The point is that the ME Too movement has eccentuated women to do what ever it takes to get their way; even if it means lying to the point that it ruins a man's life. And with how we're inclined to instantly believe what a woman says without hesitation, that's how some women out there have become powere hungry. Remember, there have been a lot of horrible men through out history, but there can be despicable women too. Never assume one gender is completely innocent."
"I love when David responds to these kinds of ""we all know it happens"" type claims with a request for an example because they never have one."
"The caller brought up an interesting point that should be explored, but instead was summarily dismissed. This manic PC culture now prevents people to even consider the possibility that a movement like ""me too"" can go too far. By the way, if you want an example of someone being prosecuted in the court of public opinion based on accusation alone, Brett Kavanaugh is a perfect example."
Me can't count to two
Why do you waste time putting people on who are doing nothing more than trying to manufacture consent for their bullshit narrative?
üòÇ this call was something else.
Agent orange...get it?! *GeT iT?!*
"While the caller is a bit snarky, he's saying that the principle of the ability to accuse someone without having to prove guilt.  Basically the simple act of accusation = a result for the impacted accused individual (in the case of Metoo typically female v male). This is what he was trying to articulate, and I may not have done a great job with my articulation either, I nonetheless understand the sentiment that it feels like if a person is going to accuse someone that they should have to prove guilt as opposed to the accused have to prove innocence."
"The ""Meetiya"". 

Lol."
pretty sure this was david feldman doing a comedy bit. he called into the majority report too üòÇ
"That has more to do with trial by media rather than a gender issue. Like anything else when MSM get a new thing, it becomes a force of its own. This caller was clearly a troll and a bit of a twit."
"Ya why couldn‚Äôt  the women just keep their mouths shut, wa wa wa"
I would say an example is what happened to Al Franken.
Maybe ask Kirsten Gillibrand what she thinks about this idea.
"I kind of agree with the caller. I wonder if some of the men who lost their jobs because of the Me Too movement (for example, Tavis Smiley) really deserved it, and I think some women (for example, Yvette Vega) haven't really paid a price for their complicity.

Don't get me wrong, I think the Me Too movement is _mostly_ a good thing, but I don't support everything that has happened."
"I think the caller has a point. The #MeeToo movement has in some way ""victoried itself to death""."
Such misogyny from a gay man total control?‚Äô Srsly wtf?
The name says it all... Total Control... and it sounds like he resents not having it. Did he really expect a movement to police individual claims.
I've been waiting for David to go full James O'Brien from LBC for a while. I need a full show of this.

"The most I‚Äôd give this caller is that misogynistic voters may be more activated in reaction to #MeToo. Similar to how social gains for the LGBTQ, the growing minority-majority, and increased political power for minorites have activated reactionaries for quite some time now"
"David, you have the potential to easily have 4-5 million subscribers. You are the same personality type as Andrew Yang, but he has shored up his weaknesses in EQ and social intelligence. You are an intellectual giant, but without balancing out your innate weaknesses, you are holding yourself back. You are right at that age where INTJs tend to clue in to their weaknesses and everything gets better. Especially your most valued intuition (it goes through the roof) and personal relationships. I am the same type and I have learned a lot from Yang. You could learn a lot from him too."
"i think that not going through with the accusations might have caused some problem for women, but i dont know what type of problem. So many accusations against trump that ended without any resolve, but i also dont know what they could've done, since if the women were sexually assaulted they should come forward."
David:  Please be more discerning with your video postings.  Save the lame ones for the community forum.
He asked him specifically many time for an example and then he spouted Flores then the caller backed off and said that's what your saying??... ?? Wtf I had to listen 3 times to try to understand what he was getting at... it's still a mystery. How many licks does it get to the center of a tootsies pop
I will give you the examples of Aziz Ansari and Al Franken...beyond that I cannot think of any other abuses of the Me Too movement.

I dont know anything about this hair-sniffing scandal, but I wish you greased the argument's wheels further so that I could get the chance to hear a proper rebuttal from you and possibly a counter-argument from him about the topic."
What is this show anymore?
I can‚Äôt believe I was about to give this guy the benefit of the doubt (off video title alone). I agree that he definitely should have just left a voicemail. He *does* sound like a goddamn creep.
"The guy is bringing up something many people like him feel. His thoughts are shared by more people one would like to believe is possible (men and women alike). They should be allowed to speak there piece since if they don't, there will be no resolution to this problem that exists. The guy wasn't prepared for the questions he was getting."
Finally justice!
"Jesus loves you. If you repent of your sins and give your life to Him: He will fill you with love, give you happiness in your life, and bless you. The next time that you feel sick or worried or scared, ask Jesus into your heart and your life will get better. Videos will never fill the void inside of you, but Jesus will if you give your life to Him. He will love you, keep you company, and answer your questions. He is real and a lot of the time He will speak to you through your conscience. God is love and everything good comes from Him. Everything good in the world comes from love. Romantic love, familial love, friendship, the love you feel for your hobbies, the love you have for your favorite music, favorite food, favorite movie, etc. All of it comes from God. Without love there is no point to life. It is what we all live for and it is what we were all made for, but the devil tries to ruin everything with fear, stress, worry, etc. Try to get to know God. He is truly worth worshipping."

He called her honey because he's a bee.
"Seinfed is awesome: ""Men and women chase after each other, right? .....RIGHT?!?!""."
She wanted to set him up but Jerry is not a fool.
He dated a 17 year old when he was in his 40's. He's never seen anything creepy happen.
‚ÄúRight. RIGHT.‚Äù Well said Jerry.
"I like how she tried to make a deal out of him calling her ‚Äúhoney‚Äù, and he was essentially like, ‚Äú yeah, we‚Äôre not doing that.‚Äù She was wise to let it go. üòÇ"
She is trying so very hard to bait him into saying something he'll regret. He sees the game and calls her on it repeatedly. What's impressive is that he does it in a way that simultaneously indicates that he won't be pushed around but at the same time doesn't come off as defensive or petty. He doesn't rise to her provocation. That's tough to do on your feet.
Jerry is very good at isolating a question and answering it directly and not being suckered into a debate. He‚Äôs funny and a good listener and a very talented comedian.  Glad I grew up around his show.
"That second ""RIGHT???"" was a thing of beauty üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"""honey"" is equivalent to ""bless your heart"""
That was a premature honey. Now he's got to go calling everyone honey so it looks like he's just a guy who says honey a lot.
jerry dated a high school girl when he was 38 but he's never seen comedians being creeps. look in the mirror honey
"Jerry's smarter than I thought. I always thought he was an average comedian, but he was great at not being baited and trapped with the ""right?"""
"""Men and women chase after each other ,right?.....RIGHT?!""  Jerry's no fool, he sees what shes about"
"He's 100% right.  This is in every industry,  in every part of life. Its in the film Industry, its in education, its in coaching, its in the financial world, its in the arts, its in health care........its a humanity problem not one specific industry."
Of course the man who dated a teenager in his 30's doesn't think Weinstein did anything wrong lmfao
"00:55  i love how he forces her to admit the obvious instead of just asking the questions and putting all the liability on him.  that's gold, jerry... 'ts gold!!!"
‚ÄúHoney‚Äù is Jewish for ‚Äúwell bless your heart‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"Seinfeld is saying that the ""honey"" thing is an idiom for ""you're being naive"" about this being about the industry, it is everywhere."
He‚Äôs like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask me about my 17 year old girlfriend‚Äù
"I loved the way he leaned in and asked her ""right??"" As if she could deny it somehow...üòâüòÇüòÖüòÇüòÖ"
"My God, how much I loved that second ""RIGHT?"". She wasn't going to concede anything, not even that men and women could voluntarily have sex with each other."
She tried to paint him into a corner and Jerry was having none of it. Good for him.
The casting couch started in the film industry and became synonymous with it. You can say it happens everywhere but that doesnt get the industry off the hook as Jerry thinks.
"That wasn‚Äôt an accident by Seinfeld, he knew exactly what he was doing, that was a professional ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù."
"She was all like, ‚ÄúWho does this guy think he is?!‚Äù

And he was all like, ‚Äú...I‚Äôm Keith Hernandez.‚Äù"
"Interviewer after: ""Can I get a hug?""
Jerry: ""No thanks..""
Interviewer: ""A little one?""
Jerry: ""..mm. no.."""
Funny how Louis C.K. overcame the controversy and owns it in his shows now.
I like that he managed to make her laugh while talking about such a serious thing. Navigating sensitive topics isn‚Äôt even what he‚Äôs known for but he handled this well.
"That ""RIGHT!?"" was such a power move."
Jerry will never be uncomfortable against anyone ever...
I love how Jerry speaks his mind and tells it like it is. I appreciate him for putting it out there with no fear!
i love how he turns the interview into the start of a seinfeld episode
"I love Jerry's interviews, he doesn't play the game..."
"As a woman I can say it‚Äôs true, this happens in every club, in work places, in the street, wherever, it‚Äôs not the show business, it‚Äôs everywhere"
"Everyone's talking about the ""honey"" interaction but low-key that's the most intelligent thing I've heard about the me too movement. It's not new, it's not confined to the ""industry"", it's about the global difference between the sexes."
"What is difficult in these scenarios is straying the coversation from being hostile, while still conveying your point. Given the context, those were some fantastic social skills."
Seinfeld has absolute contempt for nonsense and I love that.
I will always remember Jerry Seinfeld for dating an underage teenager when he was more than twice her age.
"""RIGHT?!"" - the best part. He didn't let her get away to try to fabricate her own reality in front of gullible viewers but instead actually making her acknowledge the reality as it is most time when men and woman are together in situations like that - which is is frivolous, before moving on with the topic. Excellent"
"""You cannot not be funny.""
""Of course I can! Am I being funny now?""
""A little.""
Even here."
"""Men and women chase after each other, right?"" 
* blank stare *
""RIGHT???""
Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!"
I like how he dealt with her. Respectful yet didn‚Äôt take any of her shit
"""It's not even a good story.""
Summed up perfectly with one line."
"‚ÄúMen and women chase eachother, right?‚Äù
[She refuses to answer]
‚ÄúRight?!‚Äù"
I‚Äôm so happy to hear common sense come from my one of my favorite comedians ‚ù§
Don‚Äôt try an bait a comedian.  They make a living talking and being quick witted. They will go on the offense. It‚Äôs what they do
I remember when calling someone honey was a nice thing. It‚Äôs not like he was flirting. The lunch lady calls me honey and it‚Äôs very sweet
Bravo for refusing to be defensive or to follow a bs narrative.
‚ÄúDid you see any of it‚Äù Guy dated a 17 year old when he was 38. He‚Äôs part of the problem üòÇ
"I think, the word "" honey"" was used sarcastically and she deserved the sarcasm."
"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the industry, honey‚Äù

I like how he slipped a Bee Movie reference in there"
"Seinfeld himself, like the show that bears his name, is brilliant. Even pausing to get the interviewer to acknowledge that yes, through time immemorial, men and women chase each other. He doesn‚Äôt give anyone a pass, but places it within the context of his observable reality only. Brilliant."
Oh he definitely knew what was going on ü§£ ü§£ ü§£ ü§£ ü§£
Jerry has added so much laughter to my life and he continues to do so everytime he opens his mouth. Love you Jerry.
"Jerry is smart, no B.S., and clearly a step ahead of the interviewer. This is why he's a major force in the business."
I remember Larry David in Curb telling Richard lewis: You just gave a premature honey üòÖ
"Jerry Seinfeld dated a 17 year old when he himself was 38. So I can't help but feel like he's an unreliable narrator. Also, isn't it true that sexual misconduct is very common in the entertainment industry, when compared to other fields? I could be wrong about that, but it is something I have heard and it seems like the case when you keep hearing about these things."
"Dude who dated a kid as a 38 year old man and said that she was actually on the old side while confronted about it on TV claims he never saw anything.
Sure."
"""Honey"" is a very show biz way of saying, ""Get over yourself Lady"""
The way she tries to make Seinfeld look stupid by creating awkward silence at specific moments in the conversation is absolutely dishonest.
Says the guy who dated a 17 year-old when he was 38. üôÑ
"We all know who set up this question...
NEWMAN!"
Interviewer a minute in: ‚ÄúShit...this guy‚Äôs way smarter than me.‚Äù
"""You gotta get with this, this isnt showbiz ""

Dude wasn't messing!"
This man dated a 17 year old when he was 38 and has the gall to criticize Hollywood morality.
"""What's the deal with HARASSMEENT?!?! Can't you just ask her out"" - Jerry Seinfeld, the method comedian"
Jesus Christ he took control of the the whole conversation with a woman using his aggressive voice and it actually worked!
Jerry took control of that interview like the pro that he is. How to call someone ‚Äúhoney‚Äù and not be apologetic. Never really enjoyed his work but this was 2 mins of must watch. She thought she had him but he squashed that in 2 seconds flat.
Would she ask the same question if Jerry was a woman? Nope. She'd rather not acknowledge that women in powerful positions knew about it and did nothing.
The man is too smart and secure to fall for lazy interview tricks.
"My mom has called every waitress/waiter honey for 40+ years , I never thought for a moment she was saying anything inappropriate AND I STILL DON'T."
"its not the industry, Honey. 

                         -30 yo man who married a 15 yo child"
"He's 100% right - every time there's an incident the narrative is ""X industry/institution has a sexual harassment issue"". No. There's nothing peculiar about that industry. Any place where rich, powerful and influential men are working with women, you have the same issue, whether its the armed services, academia, entertainment, business, law, government, religion or the local library. And it's not a cultural thing either. The same thing happens everywhere around the world and throughout history. But the media can't make hay around something that's been happening since the beginning of time. They have to insist that that particular industry has an issue."
"I'm 64 years old, living my entire life literally 10,000 miles away from Hollywood. At the age of 12, I knew what the casting couch was. How did these women not know? It's not victim blaming. It's asking why did they walk into the room knowing the animal was dangerous?"
Jerry has nothing to lose and can be completely honest. It‚Äôs refreshing.
"‚ÄúYou just called me honey‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, it must have been very painful for you darlin‚Äù"
"She's so used to just being able to say ""You just called me 'honey'"" and get the guy to crawl up in a fetal position and say he's sorry, that when he just responds with ""yep"" she has absolutely nothing."
How anyone thought Seinfeld was not annoying is beyond me
seinfeld sounds more and more like an older jewish man with every year that passes
I‚Äôve always appreciated Jerry as a human and a comedian. üí™üèª true brilliant man ‚ù§Ô∏è
Such a killer response from this question when she wasn‚Äôt actually asking the question for his answer.
i miss louis c.k. guy has a talent to be funny
She made a fool out herself and Jerry was very kind about it
The fact he stayed chill when she tried to call him out on being ‚Äúwrong‚Äù for saying honey...chill as an ice cube
Ricky Gervais summed it up perfectly at Golden Globes.
"Love how he countered her disapproving  silence with ""right""!
Brilliant!"
Reminder that a 38 year old Jerry Seinfeld dated a 17 year old until she was 21. I‚Äôm not gonna take some creep‚Äôs opinion on another creep
"""What's wrong with your industry?"" ...As if she's not part of the media. Half the MeToo allegations came from women in the news business (against Matt Lauer, Mark Halperin, Charlie Rose, Roger Ailes, Bill O'Reilly). Seinfeld should've asked her if SHE'S seen something, and why didn't she do anything about it?"
Seinfeld dated a 17 year old high schooler when he was 38.
"""I haven't seen any sexual misconduct."" Meanwhile Seinfeld dated a 17 year old when he was about 38. Why does every single comment here defend and or praise him? This is coming from someone who grew up watching Seinfeld, that show is part of my earliest memories, a time upon which I look fondly. But that won't keep me from seeing Jerry Seinfeld for who he is."
"I love how he turns this into a bit‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWhat is it to SHOWER for somebody? I don‚Äôt even understand it. Who wants to watch somebody shower? ‚Ä¶‚Äù 1:55
Hilarious üòÜ
She even laughed‚Ä¶ good comedians can do that‚Ä¶ laughing at the absurdity of some situation, in spite of how one feels about it."
"her: ""you just called me honey""
Seinfeld: ""yeah, were you not here two seconds ago?"""
"FYI, Jerry Seinfeld dated a 17-year-old when he was 38.  Her name was Shoshanna Lonstein and he met her in a park.  Totally normal shit, right?"
He literally broke her down to his level of logic and reasoning before she could get to her cancelling gotcha questions
I love the way he made her answer üëç her playing dumb.
Jerry Seinfeld refuses to let the the interviewer put words in his mouth and I think that's great the way he controls the narrative.
Jerry Seinfeld dated a 17yo when he was in his 40s. He‚Äôs acting defensive bc he‚Äôs afraid
always funny for the guy who dated a high schooler in his late 30s to try to be the morality police
"""You just call me honey""
I'm sure there were plenty of other words he wanted to say, but Jerry is a class act."
Flirting is fine if the girl thinks you're sexy. If she doesn't its a criminal offense which can ruin your life. It's bollocks.
I thought she was doing kung fu.
"""Owen has got issues"" talk about the pot calling the kettle black!"
Does she offer karate lessons?
For her to say we should listen to woman and hear their struggles is very ironic. She ignores that men are saying that there version of sexual assault is different to what other believe is sexual assault nd if there is no line that this issue will keep happening.
"If a guy she fancies talks to her it's flirting, if a guy she doesn't fancy or doesn't offer her a film role then it's rape."
"Rose Mcgowan is a very, very insecure woman. I really feel so sorry for her.  She is absolutely NOT a good spokesperson for any movement. She is so tense she makes me nervous.  I hope she can get help but I doubt she will..."
Why did she shave her head?
I love you Rose. Stay BRAVE!
that made me cringe
Stop giving the clown oxygen .
She's a 4th Dan in #MeToo Jitsu
Thought it was very disrespectful what she said about Owen at the start of the video.
Need to bleach my ears after this. All about her trying to remain relevant
"This woman is not a good woman, her freinds are occultists, funny how she went quiet when her friend whom is a accuser herself has just been accused of sleeping with a 17 year old lad  and she played his mother on a show."
Be Gentle
Every guy in the 70s or 80s would be jailed with the crazy metoo movement !
Im from Sweden. Help. Dont walk our way. Please nuce us.
