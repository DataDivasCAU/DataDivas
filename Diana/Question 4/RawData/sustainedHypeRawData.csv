男性受害者更難被社會接住？台灣Metoo該借鏡美國經驗？ ft.陳柏偉、鎖吶
"My brother (at the time a 15y boy) was wrongly accused for rape together with a friend of his. 3 days in jail when the police didn't give them sleep and started questioning every half hour threatening my 15y old brother with violence.

After three days the victim showed up and looked through a one sided blind window and said she didn't recognize them, so they where free to go without the police saying sorry to the boys.

I got 3 other stories where boys and young men wrongly accused for rape and how our society is 99% of time siding up with females.

It is scary how much evil can be done by women with the blind support of police and society. Women that are blackmailing to get their way in live are the worst!"
"When sexually arrest men, and when a man tells her or he doesn’t say anything, people call him gay, but not knowing that it also makes him uncomfortable too, so he’s afraid to say something. People will judge him not judge him."
The black women is right
Blame Hollywood
We hire less women now because we don’t want our guys to get falsely accused.
"What downfall? He's continued to write, direct and be successful."
Money buys you freedom
Downfall? He's successful
"He has, unlike the other two directors, been completely exonerated years ago."
"Non giudico l'uomo, non abbiamo gli elementi per farlo, ma come attore, regista, sceneggiatore è un vero genio, insuperabile. Quando sarà il suo momento lascerà un vuoto incredibile. È il mio preferito. 👋👋👋"
Leave him alone. They are happy together and she has made zero complaints. Geez this place is trashed by propaganda and corruption. What a stench.
"They’ve been married for like decades, at what point do you just get over it and accept that their weird relationship worked"
Festival boss Alberto Barbera is correct.
"Woody is 35 years older than I am, now that’s funny said Soon Yi"
#MeJew
"La vidéo est excellente et intéressante, je trouve ça juste dommage de ne pas avoir parlé de la fin de l’affaire Sandra Muller notamment avec le fait qu’elle a été reconnue coupable de diffamation envers la personne qu’elle a accusé"
"comment en tant que femme on peut OSER dire ""passez a autre chose, ne soyez pas choquée pour la vie"" mais c'est la honte, honteuse madame"
"Le nombre de commentaires qui essaient de minimiser les faits de viol c'est incroyable... un rapport obtenu sous la contrainte ou la menace est un viol ! Celles qui refusaient ses avancés se faisaient retirer des projets et il incitait les autres à ne pas faire appel à elles ! Quand c'est ton métier c'est un levier de pression énorme, si on vous menaçait de vous retirer vos sources de revenus si vous ne cédez pas je pense que la situation ne serait pas aussi binaire que ça."
"Un sujet sensible, abordé avec finesse et sobriété, franchement bravo à toi Gaspard, toujours un plaisir de visionner tes vidéos et hâte de voir ce que tu nous prépare pour 2023 !"
"L'autre qui dit que c'est aux femmes d'etre forte quand il y a un frotteur ca me rend folle. Le mec qui fait ca on devrait lui couper les couilles mais non c'est a la femme de dire ""excusez moi, vous vous branlez contre ma cuisse, je ne suis pas choquée mais faite votre vie ailleurs"""
"Très bonne vidéo!! Et merci d'avoir parlé de la fondatrice du mouvement me too, Tarana Burke, une militante afro-americaine qui est souvent invisibilisée parce que tout le monde pense que ce sont des femmes blanches qui ont créé ce hashtag, alors qu'il existait déjà depuis des années avant 2017 dans la communauté noire. J'ai cru à tord que tu n'en parlerais pas et j'ai été agréablement surprise, preuve que tu as bien fait tes recherches !"
"Une superbe video comme d'habitude ! Les histoire de  sont toujours aussi intéressant.
Vu que nous sommes en 2023 , ce sera les 10 ans de la mort de Nelson mandela
Je pense qu'un histoire de nelson mandela ou sur l'appartheid en afrique du sud serai super intéressant !"
Un sujet clivant que tu abordes avec qualité et avec une aisance à l'oral qui nous permet de rester captivés. Tes vidéos immersives méritent d'être davantage regardées.
"Etonnant de la part de ce Westein, avec son sourire, sa beauté si touchante et son elocution toute en délicatesse, tout en lui dégageait l'elégance ! 😅"
"Merci beaucoup d’avoir abordé ce sujet avec autant de clarté et d’intelligence ! 
Comme je l’ai déjà vu dans les commentaires, je conseille également le film She Said qui retrace l’enquête de Jodie et sa collègue au NY Times. Cela m’a person permis de bien mieux comprendre l’émergence de ce mouvement !"
"Ces quelques notes au piano en musique de fond, c'est la musique de The Social Network. Je le dis parce que j'arrivais pas à retrouver d'où je l'avais entendue, donc si certains cherchent... si ça peut aider"
Great video mate. A funny anecdote : in english media Farrow was given much more spotlight and had to remind people on a few occasions in his interviews that he was not the first person to uncover the story.
Bravo! Une super vidéo comme d'habitude avec un travail impressionnant de recherche et d'écriture. Merci à toi et toute ton équipe pour tout le contenu que vous proposez
"Je sais pas si tu as vue le film ""She Said"", sortit en 2022, adapté du livre. C'est un super film qui brise le cœur en entendant tout ses témoignage de femme terroriser par cette homme."
Cette video etait vraiment immerssive rien a dire sur la calité du montage et la narration etait juste incroyable j atteds la prochaine video avec grande impatience!
"Je viens de visionner le film ""she Said"" sur le sujet . Ta vidéo est parfaite pour illustrer le sujet et l'approfondir.Bravo"
« C’est pas votre faute mais vous vous traumatisez pas pour le reste de votre vite » faut y aller pour sortir ça
"Infiniment Merci Gaspar G
J'apprécie votre talent 
En lisant ensuite les commentaires 
Pour les précisions partagées 
Et donc Merci aussi à toutes & tous 

Avec Bienveillance & Gratitude 
Cordialement 
🤲🙏♾🙏🤲"
"Une vidéo passionnante, merci à toute l’équipe pour ce travail si qualitatif !!"
"Pour les curieux qui veulent en savoir encore plus sur l'affaire Weistein, il y a un film, très intéressant, qui s'appelle ""She said"" qui retrace toute l'histoire."
"Salut Gaspard, ton contenu est hyper qualitatif, je sais que ça prend du temps mais ça serai possible de faire plus régulièrement des « Histoires de » ?"
"Toujours un plaisir de t’écouter (malgré le sujet….). 
Tu as une façon intelligente précise et concise de raconter !
Hâte de voir les prochaines vidéos !"
j'aime bien parce que la femme dit que c'est aux femmes d'être forte et de dire aux hommes de ne pas se frotter mais c'est à eux de ne pas se comporter de manière si dégueulasse dans un lieux publique.
"C'est super de regarder tes Vidéos Gaspard, trés intéressant ... merci à toi"
"Bravo à toute l'équipe pour cette vidéo 👍
J'étais pas en France pendant cette période et j'ai l'impression d'avoir récupéré 5 ans d'infos en 10mn, et bravo aux femmes qui ont eu le courage de témoigner"
"Incroyable qualité et un travail de dingue,  super vidéo merci !!! Bon courage pour la suite"
"Vidéo intéressante et basée sur l'impartialité,
merci pour ça. Je voulais ajouter qu'en France la
diffamation est rarement retenue lorsque la personne
est prise 'en grip' par les associations, comme le montage
fallacieux de France Télévision concernant l'affaire Depardieu ,
par exemple ."
"Un sujet sensible, abordé avec finesse et sobriété, franchement bravo à toi Gaspard, toujours un plaisir de visionner tes vidéos et hâte de voir ce que tu nous prépare pour 2023 !"
"Travail de qualité ça fait plaisir, le simple placement de la pub pile au bon moment et pas au milieu d’une phrase en est exemple (oui oui c’est rare)."
La vérité commence à arriver tout doucement ❤
"Rappelons, à toutes fins utiles, qu’aucun de ces viols n’a impliqué de pénétration, et que 100% des actrices qui ont refusé ses avances n’ont pas été violées. Ce qui n’enlève rien au reste, notamment les tentatives d’abus de pouvoir systématiques et permanentes, mais le portrait du prédateur sexuel en question est plutôt atypique - ce qui n’est jamais vraiment clairement exposé."
"Excellente vidéo, c’est génial que tu parles de ce genre de sujets qui a besoin de visibilité 👌"
"Incroyable vidéo, je me souviens du mouvement et en quoi il consistait plus ou moins mais très instructif, c'est bien de savoir exactement ce qu'il en ressort dans une vidéo aussi bien réalisée"
"Trop bien ces vidéos, heureuse d’être abonnée ! Le meilleur pour la suite !"
"Merci pour le boulot ! Ça résume l’affaire et tes deux parties sont hyper équilibrées, c’est un plaisir à regarder comme d’hab 🫡
Par contre 7% de viewers abonnés, sachant que t’as à peu près 300.000 vues par vidéo, ça veut dire que sur tes presque 500k abonnés il n’y a que 25k qui regardent la vidéo ? Y’a un gros problème de référencement nn?"
"18:36 ''les femmes, vous êtes traumatisées d'avoir été agressées S. Bah arrêtez'' Ok merci Catherine 🥴"
"Incroyable vidéo, encore !! Très bien écrit, très bien structuré, très bien monté... Bref, du grand art, BRAVO !!!
Je trouve ça bien que tu mettes les noms de toutes les personnes qui t'ont aidé sur la vidéo !"
"Trop bien la découverte de la chaîne, et trop bien les vidéos c’est très interessant et tu racontes bien ✨
Belle voix btw hihi"
Tu pourrais faire une vidéo sur l’explication de la guerre d’Algerie sinon continue comme ça !!
"toujours aussi pertinent et minutieux, merci pour tes vidéos !!!!"
"Super vidéo, merci de parler de sujets comme ça c'est hyper important. Cependant je me dois de faire une petite remarque, le fait d'utiliser les termes ""des comportements inappropriés envers les femmes"" pour désigner les agressions sexuelles et les viols n'est pas acceptable pour ma part. Ces comportements ne sont pas seulement ""pas appropriés"" ils sont horrifiants, ils sont interdits, ce sont des crimes. Et l'utilisation du terme ""inapproprié"" dans ce contexte est une énorme minimisation qui je trouve n'est pas négligeable. Sinon, continue tes vidéos, elles sont très passionnantes !"
Merci pour ton travail de synthèse
"Gaspard, t'as pas idée à quel point j'ai attendu une nouvelle vidéo de t'as part, t'as trop tarder, mais merci pour ce que tu proposes"
"Ton travail est d’une extrême justesse, merci de parler aussi bien de sujets aussi importants 🙏"
Je te découvre avec cette vidéo. J’ai hâte de voir le reste du taff fait sur cette chaîne !!
"hey ben, j'adore le format ! Super travail ! Je suis retournée par l'histoire ..."
"Il y a le film ""She Said"" sortit il y a pas longtemps qui retrace aussi cette histoire sur certaines personnes veulent en voir un peu plus ! (Même si dans mes souvenirs toutes les informations que tu dis dans ta vidéo sont aussi dans le film)"
Rien de mieux qu'une notification de Gaspard G. Très belle vidéo comme d'habitude
Coïncidence énorme ! Je suis actuellement en train de lire l’autobiographie de Rose McGowan 😮
"Vraiment intéressant, Gaspard, j’ai apprit des choses, merci."
Merci pour ton travail toujours aussi qualitatif !
Je suis tout a fait d'accord avec avec le mouvement me too je suis collégiens j'ai été victime d'attouchements et de commentaires sexiste c'est difficile pour moi...de temps en temps je me remets en question est ce que c'est moi qui a cherché ça.. mais avec l'aide de mes parents je vais mieux et je continue ma vie normale
"Super intéressant 👌 Puis la dynamique de fin, poualala.
En theme yen a tellement mais perso sur histoire de different pays ça serait super intéressant : Genre l'histoire de la France (en plusieurs ep), le Japon, l'Amérique, l'égypte,...
Et sinon en personnage un episode sur louis de Funès, Hitler, La reine Elizabeth, tellement de possibilitées🤩
Continue commence, jkiff tes vidéos"
"Clair, propre, concis ... un très bon travail ... bravo jeune homme je te souhaite une longue vie médiatique... on ne s'ennui pas une seconde"
Il y a également le film She Saïd sorti il y a quelques années. Très bien fait et très éclairant sur l'affaire
"Salut Gaspard, j'adore ce format j'ai tout regardé, je me disais qu'un épisode ""Histoire de"" sur la vie de Joseph Kessel, un homme au mille vies, ça serait super intéressant :)"
super interessant comme d’habitude!
"Dans le cas de Sandra Muller il aurait peut-être été judicieux d'expliquer l'affaire judiciaire (encore en cours, il me semble)"
"Franchement, j'aurais jamais pensé à lui ... Superbe vidéo ! Et prochain sujet Strauss Khan !!  (DSK)"
"Claire et bien sur documenté comme d'habitude 👍. Et même quand on a pu suivre l'affaire, tu nous apprends toujours certains côtés que nous pouvons ne pas connaître.
Merci, merci pour toutes les femmes"
"Super vidéo, vraiment. C'est tellement intéressant, clair et bien raconté merciii ! ❣❣"
Une nation ne peut évoluer sans prendre en considération la moitié de son humanité.
"Oui ! 

Encore une vidéo de notre célèbre Gaspard G 
Tu es génial, continue tes vidéos !"
trop bien la vidéo ça fait plaisir de te revoir!
Je me baladais sur ta chaine en espérant regarder une video que je n'avais pas encore vu et hélas j'avais déjà fait le tour mais miracle !  tu viens de refaire ma soirée en sortant cette video ! merci à toi et bravo pour ton travail et ton equipe qui se cache dans l'ombre !
Merci c'est toujours un plaisir!! Et très enrichissant. Merci beaucoup 🙏😊
"Vidéo très intéressante, bien expliquée et dynamique malgré tout ! Merci à toute l’équipe ! +1 abo"
A quand l'histoire sur Valery Giscard d'Estaing ? Pour le fun ? Ou alors George Pompidou ? Ou alors Raymond Poincaré ?
Bonjours Gaspard tu devrais une réel sur le meet Too homme qui est apparut sur X
Gaspard je te remercie j’avais besoin pour un exposé de détail sur cette affaire tu viens de me sauver
"13:01 ""ça marche super bien, car il est resté super longtemps""😂😂😂"
"Je ne connaissais pas les origines, merci  c'est bien expliqué"
Enfin la vidéo que tt le monde attendait 😀
"Pourrais tu faire « l’histoire de Pablo escobar » ça serait super cool.
Ps : super vidéo continue"
Super vidéo moi je t'ai pas vraiment au courant de cette histoire je connaissais de bon mais bon ça sert à ça ta chaîne et c'est super merci encore pour cette histoire

"C'est vrai que Catherine Millet est totalement une habituée du métro et aux frotteurs ""du métro"" ... 😂"
j’espère du plus haut de mon cœur que tes videos soient montrees dans les ecoles
"Du montage au contenu, ta vidéo est vraiment bonne. Bon travail Gasp !"

"Merci pour la qualité de cette vidéo, comme toujours!! Est ce que tu pourrais parler des Panama Papers ? J'ai toujours eu du mal à comprendre cette histoire..."
"Grand sujet, voir meme délicat. Je trouve très bien abordé et bien écrit. 
Bravo à toute l'équipe."
"J’adore la simplicité et l’ambiance des histoires. J’ai pensé à un sujet, je sais pas si ça a déjà été fait ou si c’est un sujet intéressant mais je pose ça la. A propos du crash d’avion du gouvernement polonais en 2010. Bonne continuation"
"salut gaspard, ne fait pas attention aux vues qui sont très nettement moins élevées que ton contenu ""histoire de..."". Ce sont des contenus importants et crois moi, tu éduques indirectement les jeunes. Merci pour cette vidéo qui a du être très délicate à écrire mais qui est au final réussi! bonne continuation"
Ma nouvelle chaîne YouTube préférée ❤❤❤❤
"Salut, je t’es découvert hier et depuis je regarde toute tes vidéos ! Qualités incroyables, j’espère que tu iras très loin ! 

Ps: Un jour l’histoire d’Eminem ( j’aimerai bien l’entendre venant de toi )

"Superbe vidéo comme d’habitude, j’adore ce que tu propose comme contenue 👍"
"Merci pour ton travail! Vraiment interessante et me semble très complète…
J’espère vraiment que ça va réduire jusqu’à cesser… ce sont vraiment d’horribles faits par des personnes tellement aléatoires…"
Bravo aux femmes journalistes qui ont réussi à mettre fin au agissements de ce grand pervers sexcuel elles ont rendu justice à toutes les victimes Merci Gaspard pour ton sérieux de traiter ces affaires si difficile
"Discours fluide, des faits chronologiques,  des sources croisées GaspardG a bien creusé son enquête"

Passionnant… bravo. Continue comme ça! J’aime ton traitement de l’info.

"Why Annamalai is quiet? Is it because of wrestlers in Delhi? Why Kushboo NCW Member is silent? Why Southern Artists Artistes are quiet? How Hindu Frontline are silent? What Mr Ram has to say?
What MP Kanimozhi has to say? 
Ministry/Deptt dealing with women's welfare is silent. SC has to take suo moto action. Intellectuals in Tamil Nadu should follow up. POCSO has to include ladies also. It should be straightaway a cognizable non-bailable offence. Proof of innocence should lie on the molester, rapist.

S.Shankar Ghaziabad"
Powerful woman..chinnammaa..god bless you dear
Super voice
"Shameless govt  of TN that influenced pervert guy to ruin real talent. No stupid guy raised the issue.

Sharif Banda zaleel hi hota hai Pakistan India dono main aur dono mulko k log logo k haq ko support nhi krte balkay political parties and influence ko support kr k khud ko bewakoof bnatay hain. She is one of my favourite singer and I support her for standing with justice. This is the purpose of our lives if we understand, but the life is very hard on this path."

"If you invite your enemy for your wedding and fall on his feet to get blessings. And you say your mother forced you to, you are stupid! Period. Where is the boldness you have now? No mom would let an abuser  6 feet within your daughter. Who is he fooling? Was her mother a brothel owner who will ignore daughter’s plight?"

Shi born from Britishian???
"Ce que j'ai retenu le plus, c'est l'augmentation des femmes battues durant la pandémie de covid. Je déteste ces lâches. Ça me rappelle la dernière violence de mon père sur ma mère. Puis grâce à notre voisine ( une mamie), tout c'est arrêté. Elle est intervenue. Il a eu un déclic. Nous ne l'oublierons jamais ainsi que tout le quartier🥰."
il faudrait qu'on évoque un jour les violences faites aussi aux hommes par des hommes ou par des femmes dans le privé et dans l'entreprise ! Mais çà reste tabou
"Ce documentaire questionne le droit des femmes. Il ne s’agit pas de mettre en conflit les femmes contre les hommes. Si vous comprenez ce docu de la sorte c’est que vous n’avez pas comprit le but du travail de ces femmes qui luttent contre les formes institutionnalisées d’inégalité des sexes. Il ne s’agit pas de diaboliser les hommes, il s’agit de dialoguer sur le rôle de l’état. Lorsque l’Etat ou le gouvernement impose aux femmes des formes de soumission (IVG illégal, impossibilité de s’éduquer, impossibilité de divorcer etc…) c’est qu’il y a quand même un problème. La normalisation de la violence conjugale et familiale ne concerne pas non plus que les hommes dans le rôle de bourreau (89% d’hommes pendant le covid, une majorité certes mais le reste ce sont des femmes maltraitantes), et dans le rôle des victimes il n’y a pas que des femmes, il y a aussi des enfants dont des petits garçons qui pourraient à leur tour reproduir le schéma en devenant maltraités ou maltraitants."
"Quand je vois à quel point la présomption d'innocence a été foulée aux pieds, je me dis que prendre un peu de recul n'est pas plus mal. 
Et puis, un peu marre de ce discours consistant à faire passer la moitié de l'humanité pour des pauvres petites choses fragiles. La femme est l'égale de l'homme ; la première n'est pas une proie et le deuxième un prédateur."
Ça commence par une systématiquement grossière du patriarcat.
Fantastique vidéo! Merci BEAUCOUP à ces femmes qui font avancer l’égalité femmes-hommes.
"Première phrase du magazine, premier mensonge.
J'ai du mal à croire que ces 3 jeunes femmes soient directrices d'observatoires ou de quelconques instituts faisant un travail sérieux.
Dès le début on nous les présentes puis il s'agit d'exprimer leurs impressions sur une photographie sur laquelle un homme s'apprête à frapper sa compagne .

La première d'entre elles s'interroge sur le signalement à la police de cette violence, la réaction des policiers, l'aide apportée par l'état et la société, et sur la CAPACITÉ FINANCIÈRE de la jeune femme à METTRE UN TERME A LA RELATION !!! Ce sont ses mots...
Non non, on ne rêve pas, à 3'50"" il est déjà question de laisser ses valeurs et sa sécurité de coté pour une question d'argent... Ca sent mauvais pour la suite de la vidéo.

La deuxieme ( la française en plus 🤦‍♂️), dès sa première phrase dis  "" Cette photo illustre LA réalité à laquelle la MAJORITE des femmes sont confrontées""..."" On sait que 1/3 des femmes sera confrontée à un episode de violence dans sa vie"". Voilà, ça résume le brouillard victimaire qu'on nous envoit en pleine figure.. 1/3 est maintenant devenu une majorité, et une réalité horrible et omniprésente se substitue à un instant difficile de sa vie.
Elle souhaite que l'état fasse en prévention des violences sexistes et sexuelles de la "" politique volontariste à tous les niveaux"", ainsi qu'à l'école... !

La troisime finit de m'achever à 4""55 en prononçant devant cette photo la phrase suivante d'emblée : "" Je ne sais pas comment sortir de cette situation, et même sortie je ne sais pas comment rester en vie"".. "" Comment fait'on une fois sortie pour vivre dans une société où on sait qu'on est pas soutenue par l'ETAT"", "" ça pose des questions sur le droit des femmes, la citoyenneté, la manière dont on vit ensemble..."" 

Résumons.. Dans les 5 premières minutes d'introduction du sujet, nous sommes invités à considérer la femme ( la majorité apparemment...) comme un être profondément fragile, dominée par l'homme qu'elle se choisit pour partenaire, et qui au lieut de penser à se lever et à faire ses valises, attend que l'état lui vienne en aide et la protége.
Pire, au lieu d'imaginer une prevention qui aide les femmes à être fortes, à se respecter, à reconnaître les signes de domination et à les fuir, ou à combattre le sexisme, hé bah non 🤷‍♂️ Il faut encore et toujours se poser en victime et maintenant prévenir les jeunes filles ( de leurs futures mauvais choix et faiblesses ? Nooon) que leur copains de recré deviendront de méchants garçons...🤦‍♂️

On est dans une caricature du féminisme qui fait tout sauf du bien aux femmes."
"le reportage part sans doute d'une volonté de bien faire, mais à 20 mins la théorie du genre ....pointe discrètement son nez, c'est furtif mais quand même, je ne savais pas que la vision genrée du monde : mâle-femelle était ""traditionnelle"" ? La biologie est traditionnelle, voir archaïque ??"
soyons seul c'est super....méchants hommes......
"Une approche féministe, comme d'hab. 
Jusqu'au jour où on ne sortira pas de cette logique, pour aller vers une approche vraiment neutre et anti-sexiste (ce qui le féminisme n'est pas), nous il y aura forcément des déséquilibres dans les rapports de genre."
"Dans qq années, le retour du balancier va être terrible (c'est ainsi qu' a tjrs fonctionné la marche du temps ) et ts les ""progressistes"" d'aujourd'hui vont avoir du plomb dans l'aile..."
"Résistez les femmes, on est avec vous! <3"
"La vie de la bourgeoisie semble vraiment difficile, les grandes écoles et les hauts postes sont des fardeaux 🙂"
"Ce qui n'est pas évoqué ici, c'est la menace que fait peser le transgenrisme sur le féminisme. Comme par hasard, c'est un non sujet..."
"Heureusement que les hommes ne se plaignent pas, on en finirait plus avec les hashtag"
"Je ne suis pas sure que la constitution européenne est quelque chose à voir avec le féminisme ni d'ailleurs la protection de la femme, d'ailleurs en quoi serait t'elle concernée puisqu'elle n'a pas de valeur ni de poids de quelque manière que ce soit tant au niveau civil que dans la justice, la Pologne a interdit l'avortement, elle est pourtant bien européenne ?? non ?? la violence n'est ni réprimée ni condamnée et pourtant, elle existe, arrêtons de la nier... 
Quant on voit qu'aux états unis Trump a été élu alors qu'il débitait des ignominies sur les femmes, c'est ça le modèle de société demain ?? quand est-ce que la justice fera son boulot que ce soit ici ou ailleurs pour condamner les violences qui sont inexcusables et inadmissibles
Enfin notre ministre de la justice vient de faire acquitter son fils accusé de violence conjugale, il y a quand même des questions à se poser"
"Quand on fera le proces du covid/confinement, faudra pas qu'on oublié ces victimes aussi"
J'ai la haine de ces lâches qui frappent leurs femmes et pires devant les enfants. C'est très traumatisant et on se sent minable de ne pas pouvoir sauver sa maman 💙.
4:09 Quoi???? Ok donc 1 femme sur 3 devient la majorité.... bravo
Merci pour cette vidéo !
Bravo Nika ❤
"Le féminisme c'est ni plus ni moins que l'équivalent du machisme. Il faut arrêter de tenter de faire passer les féministes pour des personnes plus recommandables que l'abruti qui va traiter les femmes comme des moins que rien. Ces deux types de personnes se moquent bien de vivre en harmonie et ne veulent que l'avantage pour leur sexe sur l'autre sexe. Et si les féministes arrivent pour l'instant à paraître fréquentables, c'est parce que la situation est en faveur des hommes. Et qu'elles jouent sur l'indignation pour empêcher les gens de réfléchir sur le fond de l'idéologie des féministes. Et sur le fait qu'elle implique le passage à un matriarcat et non à une situation d'égalité.

En plus d'un côté comme de l'autre, ils refusent d'admettre que la sexualité et sa mise sous couvert, ainsi que le fonctionnement des êtres humains est la raison des conflits qui existent entre les deux sexes.

Pour comprendre le problème,  il faut se poser des questions sur comment les choses se passent avec les animaux. Et quelles sont les solutions mises en place par ces derniers pour résoudre le problème des relations entre les individus de sexe femelle et ceux de sexe mâle.

Sans oublier que l'on ne relie pas le comportement des individus à leur environnement et à leur état émotionnel, sans oublier l'égoïsme naturel des individus qui n'a pas de sexe."
"Quand on y réfléchit bien,  la problématique se pose de cette façon : que choisir entre une société patriarcale (avec risques de violences envers les femmes) et société matriarcale (avec risque de destruction de la famille) ? Laquelle de ces deux orientations impacte le plus notre société ?"
"Égalité, parité, stop à la violence contre les femmes et  aux féminicides, pas de problèmes en ce qui me concerne ! Mais non aux amazones les machos au féminin. FTW 🏴"
Arte et le féminisme ça devient à gerber
"Toujours cette opposition malsaine entre l'homme privilégié, au dessus de tout et de surcroît bourreau ; versus la femme victime, privée et qui ne dispose d'aucun droit, réclamant le protectionnisme de l'Etat alors que le fémininisme prétend vouloir émanciper les femmes.
Il faudra m'expliquer comment on s'émancipe lorsque l'on réclame l'aide de l'état ?? Il y a un non sens de ce côté là. Cela montre bien que l'argent femme ne survit pas seule ou sans l'aide de qui que ce soit ou d'une institution.
De plus, le fémininisme parle toujours de droits mais jamais de devoirs. Le même féminisme ne se préoccupe jamais des enfants et encore moins des hommes même si pour faire passer son idéologie nauséeuse, le fémininisme prétend se battre pour l'égalité pour tous. Dans le meilleur des cas, sont évoquées les minorités. Mais qui sont les minorités ? Certainement pas les nains, culs de jatte, les trisomiques ?
J'ajouterai que ce même féminisme crache sur son héritage, puisque c'est cette société diabolique qui a apporté le confort dont la plupart peut jouir aujourd'hui et notamment les femmes. C'est toujours facile d'arriver ""après la bataille""... J'aimerais voir ces mêmes femmes dans la violence de conflits armées, je ne suis pas certain que leur idéologie tiendrait bien la route en cas de guerres.
Bref, c'est toujours la même soupe servie et réchauffée qui à force de traîner dans le frigo commence par devenir indigeste. Aucune remise en question non plus du comportement toxique que peuvent avoir les femmes et militantes féministes ...
Le sempiternel 15% d'écart de salaire sorti de nulle part alors qu'il a été démontré que ce chiffre est le résultat du salaire de tous les hommes en comparaison des salaires de toutes les femmes ... Il suffit de consultater le site de l'INSEE pour trouver des statistiques plus proches de la réalité. Cela n'a aucun sens... Le pompom aurait été de dire que les femmes travaillent gratuitement à partir de X date dans l'année ... Affligeant et honteux ...
Et j'apprends que les féministes ont tellement de temps à perdre qu'elles se mettent à compter le nombre d'interactions entre femmes dans un film et si leur conversation ne tourne pas autour d'un homme ... Pathétique.
Femmes, nous vous aimons, et je pense que beaucoup d'hommes dans l'histoire de l'humanité ont fait des odes à l'amour ... Et je dénote trop peu d'écrivaines qui ont romancé l'amour comme l'ont fait les hommes... Seulement maintenant ce fémininisme commence à lasser beaucoup de personnes car il tend vers beaucoup trop absurdité, de haine, de jeux de pouvoir, hommes comme femmes commencent à comprendre qu'il ne s'agit plus d'égalité, mais de renverser la vapeur pour prendre le contrôle. Ouvrez les yeux, tous."
"Ou là, j'ai entendu patriarcat. Ça doit être du sérieux.
Puis j'ai entendu test de bechdel, le nutriscore du cinéma engagé.
Puis masculiniste, forcément toxique. Alors que féministe forcément pas.
Perso je suis pour une patriarcat masculiniste bienveillant. 
Pour l'ecopatriarcat. Mais c'est difficile à faire entendre à des gens comme ça qu'on mène le même combat mais de façon différente.
C'est un combat sérieux, on ne peux pas le laisser aux seuls féministes."
Et maintenant ? y a plus rien !

Bref l’exemple même d’une société patriarcale…arrêtez de fréquenter des abrutis, de promouvoir le touche pas à mon pote, l’universalisme et la rencontre des luttes diverses et variées.

"16:40 Ca me fait toujours rire les militants qui se plaignent que les militants opposés à eux diffusent leur idéologie en s'organisant

Les féministes ne font elles pas des campagnes de diffamation ciblées sur les réseaux? En étant organisées..?"
"A 22mins30 : les problèmes écologiques ?! Le reportage passe par : les violences conjugales pdt les covid, à la situation Iranienne qui est générale et dont toute la population souffre, au droit à l'avortement (?!), aux droits des minorités,  aux droits à la liberté sexuelle (?!) sous entendu de la liberté individuelle sans entrave MAIS SURTOUT  sans être responsable de ces actes : Du coup il faudrait qu'on explique aux féministes comment on tombe enceinte car en 2023 ce n'est toujours pas clair pour elles..... et Nous voilà par une pirouette dans l'écologie et les pénuries d'eau en Iran .....ok..."
"Mettre sur la même plan l'interdiction de l'avortement qui une excellente chose car c'est un meurtre odieux contre l'islamisme des talibans c'est hyper déplacé...

Bref ce reportage est un ramassis de mensonges et faux problèmes"

"I have Autism, I am a white divorced guy. I would not, if I was interested, approach ladies that I didn’t know. There is no way."

There's definitely some truth in that! lol
"“Ah yes, …cafes in winter; …a nice place for a-loose-date…!!…I meant elucidate!!” 😬"
Winter...😂😂😂😂😂
The weather has always been topical as an icebreaker. It's not awkard or 'autistic' to talk about that. It's kind of offensive to people with autism to classify it that way. People say things to fill awkward silences. And we all hear people whinge about the cold all the time. I'm from Melbourne. It's never that cold there.
Or or he was being very sarcastic to her. Context
"sure we're awkward. That mostly goes away as we age. mostly. The funny thing is, past a certain age we just stop giving a fuck about the superficialities of romance. For a brief illustration in the world of fiction, see Maude Lebowski and the Dude. This isn't romance for either of them. One just wants to engage in a natural, zesty enterprise for the entertainment value ( or is up for it, anyway), the other has a fertility game plan.

Sure, they're glib. They're written that way. The thing is, once we stop caring, we can have fun. When we care, we're pray."
"It is appalling that the UN and others have not condemned violence against women.

You don't have to agree with him or like it that these are his chosen people, he doesn't need your permission to have it this way. Just wait for it. His judgement is coming.

"From what I can tell there won't be any more Gazoonies because there won't be a Gazooneyland.  I'm not saying it's deliberately intended but that seems to be how it's working out. I'm just an outsider watching with no emotional connection, just interested in events. Nobody wants to take the Gazoonies in. Not Egypt, Saudi Arabia, not anyone really. After the 1973 war, in negotiations Israel wanted to give Gazooneyland back to Egypt. They wouldn't take it. Will the war widen? I don't see how it can't.  Will the US get involved? It has no choice and it already is anyway."

Israel should have brought to the attention of Hamas rapes on October 8. Instead the UN only condemn Hamas hostage taking and the killing of Israelu civilians. The UN issued its first condemnation against Hamas for commiting attrocities on women and girls on october 13. A similar statement was issued against israel for women and girls in Gaza on October 20.
Always praying for Israel

The 'me too' movement has been weaponised for character defamation... Change my mind
Channel 4 defending Channel 4. Conflict of interest?
Such suspicious circumstances and conflicts of interest and the media ignore that. Looks likes Julian Assange again.
At least they were kind enough to keep their comments section turned on so we can see 100% of comments see straight through the bs.
The way this has been handled and his YouTube channel being demonetised before any charges actually show the corruption behind the scenes with this.
"These allegations only became a problem when Russell Brand started questioning liberal narratives.
So he got the Clarence Thomas/Julian Assange/Donald Trump/Roy Moore/Brett Kavanaugh treatment"
I will never take anonymous accusations seriously. Ever.
"As a woman I say 'stop insulting my intelligence and critical thinking skills'. Police stated that 'the women in question would probably not come forward'. And because of the meticulous way he brought the global corruption and crimes to the awareness of millions, this is an ordinary hit piece anyone saw coming 10 miles away."
The fact even comments on channel 4 can see this is bs says it all
And now Russel has been banned demonitised on youtube... Is this really that obvious??
Three years Channel 4 spent hassling anyone with any experience of RB until they found someone who would complain about him
"If this really was about 'justice' they would have given their reports to authorities, so they can investigate and charge him further."
"In a civilized, just & fair society one is supposed to be able to face their accuser & is also innocent until proven guilty."
"I had a girl who lived a few streets away when I was 14 make an accusation to my school that I was harassing her. I was attacked by her friends, my school threatened to expel me when the police were called it was revealed that she had a falling out with her boyfriend when people asked her why she was upset she came up with a story all about me. I hadn’t seen her in years, nobody believed me until the police couldn’t make her story make sense. Women like men occasionally lie, scorned women lie more than most. I think I’ll wait for the smoking gun."
"The way to solve the issue of woman or men making false claims of criminal acts- 

Have  the accuser get a consequence of the punishment of what the innocent 😇 Defendant was to get."
"Any moral high ground claimed by the people who broadcast ""Naked Attraction"" should be treated with the utter contempt it deserves."
Might be the end of 'main stream' media
"MeToo died when TV ""news"" ignored Tara Reade, Lucy Flores, Amy Lappos, DJ Hill, Caitlyn Caruso, Ally Coll, Sofie Karasek and Vail Kohnert-Yount"
Perhaps an inappropriate question to ask given that this is Ch4’s investigation? That a public broadcaster is being used to promote a particular political agenda leaves many otherwise open minded individuals wondering about what will be out of bounds in the future.  I don’t like viewing advocacy journalism.
"Not a word about Dan Wootton, how strange."
Me too showed us all that bitter women will lie and warp things for revenge!
Wait a minute...   Prince Andrew did what??
Looks like he angered some people enough to become a focal point.
Channel 4 have shown themselves up as absolute trash in this debacle.
Are they? Trial by media more like.
"Appalling behavior by some men, but not women? What about videos like Henry Cavill enduring sexual harassment for 3 minutes straight?"
"She is so articulate, it is phenomenal. 😂"
"Like a  little Jack Russell dog RB bit the ankles of BlackRock and Vanguard who own EVERYTHING, and they want to crucify him."
"Channel 4 should be ashamed of themselves for such a biased, cowardly attack on Russell. They are acting judge and jury. Russell is innocent until a police investigation and trial in a court of law can prove otherwise."
Framed
She can barely say legitimate investigation. 😮 looks likes she’s reading it off a script
"Evidence? 
Where tf is the evidence? 
Why hasn't Russell Brand been arrested? It's been 3 days already since this story broke. Wtf?!"
"Channel 4 enabled & encouraged his behavior...The channel loved his reputation, his naughtiness, his quick-witted patter, his lad culture, his outspokeness, his womanizing & his leariness.....He proved VERY popular, good for ratings & Channel 4 loved him.  So to see a former C4 Editor now taking the po-faced moral high ground is truly hilarious....! 🙄"
"It was none of those things. It was allegations made by 4 actresses, over an hour of stand up routines and tv appearances that are not evidential, and a text message that they deliberately zoomed in on to make you read one section, when in actual fact the whole text was about him not wearing a condom. 🤷🏻‍♂️"
This is why i cancelled my license - now kindly stop mucking up my YouTube feed. I came here to get away from mainstream media
Unnamed women yeah let’s have some proof pls
ch4 will be ended for this and I will dance on its rancid grave.
Channel 4 is a joke.
His youtube channel being demonetised is very telling. What is this really about... ?
Absolute nonsense.
Historically women will often lie about these things with zero repercussions when proven false.
She sounds like she needs to drink some coffee
Bogus allegations
C4 getting ratio'd 😄
"How can you say things are way better now than they have previously been? 

Literally just had Huw Edwards and Schofield come to light and that was hushed up for years within the industry."
I believe HIM.
"She said ""historically"" multiple times, so she clearly has a point."
Court case? Police? Just C4 then??
"Most of the topic seems now to be around investigating whether the allegations against R. Brand are true or not. I would also like to see the same level of questioning and investigation around whether/how this could have been a coordinated attack by the media against him, given the level of plausibility this latter assumption has... No?! Why would he be the only one to defend himself but not the mainstream media?"
LOL.. I really hope someone at CH4 is looking at the comments. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot!! 🤣
Guilty until proven guilty!!! What a joke
"Brand has enemies in high places, it was only a matter of time."
Witch-hunt
Millionaire privilege wealth and power vs   vulnerable teenagers girls and young women .
"I can easily send a email to the press tomorrow 

Hello I’m a young was a young girl too (I’m actually a 43  bald man with a fake account) 👴🏻and I was abused too please make sure this story gets on the news but please don’t put my name in your next story because the pain of remembering hurts to much 

These people who tell lies just to get attention ruin people’s lives so if this woman wants to believe the press because she read it on her phone in the morning don’t be so naive"
Has she just been to the dentist?
What needs to happen is that the people who are part of this documentary should have their lives investigated. See how they like it
"When those woman came to the medis with such serious accusations, they should be directed them to police not making a film about it."
Why is RB under intense investigation in 2023 for alleged serious wrongdoing from 2006-2013?
Lady you weren’t assaulted. You’re crime done to you was being brought into this world to espouse lies
Extremely important story for television 😂 wow how these people take themselves seriously i dont know. Trial by media is very wrong
Nobody believes this nonsense
"Amazing that suddenly all this time after the me too moment, a whole bunch of people come forward. Why not then?
Amazing that of all the things that mainstream Media could be dedicating their resources to and spending their time investigating, it’s this."
Shambles at channel 4
to say hes talking nonsense about the media is laughable if hes guilty or not. she is deffo a fool tho
From ‘me too’ say no more …. Their Truth.
if he just played ball with daddy g overnment he could ra pe all the women he wanted without repercussions. Just like every democrat politician.
"She said it, “A #MeToo moment for TV.” Sounds like an opportunistic “Gotcha!”. Innocent until proven guilty never seems to apply in these cases. For sure, Brand has been promiscuous and loathsomely lascivious in the past. He’s admitted as much. But that doesn’t automatically make him a rapist on the strength of a handful of allegations that were sought by the media not volunteered. Given his anti-establishment rhetoric, the veracity of these allegations is questionable, and people should reserve judgement unless they’re proven. But they won’t.🙄"
During the past year in particular watching and analysing his u tube content. I concluded that he has complex personality issues. But that said this did not in the main detract from the veracity of the information he presented to his viewers. His research was diligent even though delivered in an often  maniacal manner..
Guilty before found innocent
"Why are these ""young women"" only bringing this to light right before he was set to do a new tour?"
I hope he sues c4 into the ground
IS THIS TO BOOST THEIR RATINGS?
That Epstein client list though
"If this was your son you would claim different. I personally dont like Brand""s humor, but he is innocent so eat that till we know different."
"""metoo"" moment being the point when even the US realised it is time to stop giving the likes of Amber Heard a voice?."
"Why didn't they come forward at the time , I'm sure they would have been believed over a tv celeb."
One day into this story and I've lost interest already.
"Because someone is accused does that make their only option for the rest of their life ""not found guilty"" If found not guilty?"
"If Brand was Muslim channel 4 wouldn’t even report on this story , the man is innocent until proven guilty in a fair trial , while young the girls were all over the age of consent ."
"“Legitimate investigation” no it’s not you’re a ducking tv channel partnering with a newspaper. 
Least legitimate thing I’ve ever heard of 😂"
Hopefully this kills metoo for good.
You're going to need an extra large straw to suck up this BS.
"Good to see that a handicapped lady with speech problems could get to the heights of Channel 4. Well done diversity and inclusion!
Any comment on Rupert Murdochs involvement in this process, along with his lackeys at The Times?"
I hate the response to this - this whole anti-sxx narrative of the media is very unwise and frankly unhuman
"I really like Russell Brand very much but also know there are some quite dark people out there as well as normal people who have dark moments. When you witness how some perpetrators are so very very convincing with their cover up, and how legitimate seeming they can make themselves appear, it makes me realise that really we have no idea what happened and cannot make sensible judgements based off some tv appearances. I have accepted that I simply cannot know and will continue to be objective to both sides based on evidence. 

Sometimes you don't even have to make a judgement about it if you don't have access to the proper facts of a case/information. You can simply make a decision to stay impartial until you know more."
Stitch up job.
Dan Wootton is a great presenter. He drips with sincerity.
"He'll have to change his act, regardless of being guilty or not. Which can only be a bonus."
Messy cesspit of couruption it seems . Greased media at its finest.🎉
young women who want to make $$$
"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 yea, they ""rapist"" snipered him.

I am conservative, and I know I can not rise to a position of prominence and challenge the establishment."
"The accusations didn't ""arise"".... they were PURSUED.... there is a difference....and Channel 4 and the BBC were complicit in the culture at the time, which is hypocritical. Even though Russel himself is ultimately responsible, he is a better person now.... does he deserve this?"
It's all a conspiracy 😂
"Defo the main stream media ganging up on him from him speaking the truth, shut ya mouth"
“Young vulnerable women “ hmmmm I doubt that!
"Why are they bringing Russel Brand down now? Why not then? 
Well one can argue the same about the loving grandfather, who contributed to society, never broke the law in his country of new citizenship of 50 years, was well like, respected and honored in all circles......but he, in his young days was part and actively responsible for the killing of millions of Jews. So, one needs to be held accountable for all parts of their lives, no matter how well they are doing in the present."
Due proccess must be adhered to.
Pathetic 😂😂
"Heading should read..

   Russell brand is  “our” me too moment seeing you employed him"
"Yes, it lost its credibility"
Before the internet we called this ➡# the pound sign. So how stupid do they have to be to call their movement POUND ME TOO😂
This isn’t true. Women used me too to take people down who were Not creeps
"Wow, anhand der Kommentare merkt man schon wie sehr wichtig dieses Thema ist und wie sehr unreflektiert unsere Gesellschaft ist."
"Ich als Mann würde gerne darauf hinweisen, dass nicht alle Männer keine Frauenrechte wollen..🤔
ich befürworte die Gleichberechtigung aller Menschen, immer und überall...🤷🏻‍♂️"

"Ein sehr heißes Thema und definitiv wichtig anzusprechen.
Im Alltag begegnen einem genügend Beispiele, die auf eine ungerechte Behandlung hinweisen, die oft übersehen oder als selbstverständlich gesehen werden. Es ist sehr gut auf einer sachlichen Ebene darüber zu diskutieren, was in dem Beitrag deutlich gemacht wurde.
Vermutlich stammen die verbitterten Kommentare von Leuten, die mit einer aggressiven Form von Feminismus, wie er in modernen Medien weiterverbreitet ist, zu tun. Eine große Vielzahl ist für Gleichberechtigung, doch genau diese werden häufig in den Topf mit frauenfeindlichen Ansichten geworfen.
Sehr traurig, trotzdem ist der Trend positiv."
Bechdel-Test hab ich heute als ich mir den film angesehen habe zum ersten mal gehört und geht mir seit heute morgen nicht mehr aus dem kopf. Gratuliere Arte 😄
"Ich bin so froh, dass ich schwul bin und mit Frauen nichts zu tun habe."
Das thema ist so wichtig und es nur untertitelt. ich habe eine lese rechtschreibschwäche und finde es schade.
"Leider wird ARTE immer einseitiger. Von Multiperspektivität oder gar kritischem und vernunftgeleiteten Journalismus, ist in Dokus wie dieser nicht kehr viel übrig. Hochgradig emotionalisiert, wenig bis gar nicht in kontext gesetzt und fast nur noch Meinung statt Fakten. Diese spalteriache Meinungsmache führt unweigerlich zu grosen problemen."
"Habt ihr Quellen für die Zahlen die ihr dort nennt? Oder einen Kontext? Man unterscheidet bei der Gender-Pay-Gap doch zwischen ""bereinigt"" und ""unbereinigt"" (m.M.: komische Wortwahl), zumindest nach dem Statistischen Bundesamt. Hier werden wieder Fakten verzerrt und von daher kann ich den Rest schon nicht mehr ernst nehmen."
"Erschreckend die Entwicklung. Dabei geht es nicht nur gegen Frauen, sondern auch gegen viele Minderheiten.
Hier in Deutschland hat die religiöse Rechte aus den USA und ihre Positionen seit Corona leider immer größeren Einfluss. Auch die AFD vertritt deren Positionen und die hat in  den Umfragen zur Bundestagswahl 21 Prozent.
Ich kann nur sagen gruselig"
"Ist es sexuelle Belästigung wenn sich die Frauen die Jogahposen bis in die Ritze rein stoßen und dann so herum laufen, oder der gilt das als normal?"
0:36 wie einfach der Koran hier falschherum gelesen wird 😂
ich schaue das beim Kochen und ich kann kein Französisch...! bitte übersetzt doch!!!
"Zeichen der Anziehung als sexuelle Belästigung zu bezeichnen, macht flirten unmöglich. Nach einem Korb weiter zu machen, halte ich für Belästigung. Leider ist es dafür schon zu spät, um nicht in einer Schublade zu landen also flirtet man kaum noch."
"Sehr coole Doku, danke!"
"Es ist leider soweit gekommen, dass alle Männer (meine Wenigkeit eingeschlossen) auf der Arbeit grundsätzlich schweigen, sobald eine Frau den Fahrstuhl betritt. Kein Hallo oder wie geht’s, gar nichts. Besonders wenn Mann alleine ist im Fahrstuhl. Mann will sich keinem falschen Vorwurf aussetzen, hört sich übertriebenen an, aber so ist es leider."
"Für solch ein Komplexes und vielschichtiges Thema sind leider 26min zu wenig. Man könnte über den Gender Paygap in einem Land wahrscheinlich bereits die 26min gut füllen können. Auf jeden Fall sollte man beim Gender Paygap erwähnen, dass es einen bereinigten und einen unbereinigten gibt, weil beide sehr unterschiedliche Werte ergeben. Für Deutschland wären das z.B. nach Daten des Statistischen Bundesamtes zum Gender Pay Gap 2020:
- unbereinigt: 18%
- bereinigten: 6%
Und eine Diskussion starten wie man es genau erreichen möchte, den Gap zu schliessen.
IMHO: Auf diese Weise müsste man jedes der angesprochenen Themen in dem Beitrag angehen."
Doppelmoral
Bitte beim nächsten Mal synchronisieren.
Was wären wir ohne unsere überversorgten Feministen und Feministinnen ! (Seufz)
"Wieder mal so eine richtig sexistische, diskriminierende Doku."
"Ach ja. Noch mein Lieblingssatz. 
""Mütter erzieht, und verzieht nicht, eure Söhne. Sie sind nicht ""Mamas kleiner Liebling"", nicht schon ab Kindesalter "" Mann im Haus"". übrigens grauenvoll für die Seele eines kleinen Jungen. Und nicht ""Partnerersatz"". Frauen haben es auch in der Hand, zu welchen Männern ihre Söhne werden. Das könnte das Problem eventuell wenigstens zu Teil helfen zu lösen. Selfreflektion."
Aber Hauptsache es wird fleißig gegendert!
Wieso gibt es bei so wichtigen Themen keine Syncro?
Ich als Frau kann das nicht bestätigten
Feminismus ist auch nur Spaltung
Ich kann nicht in Worte fassen wie sehr ich ARTE hasse. Ein Haufen arroganter Besseerwisser. Seid froh dass ihr “zwangsfinanziert” werdet.
Idiocracy….🥸
"Wertes Arte Team, unter meinem Post von vor einem Tag sind Antworten verschwunden und ich würde nach Möglichkeit geren wissen ob ihr das wart. danke im Vorraus..."
"Ich muss zugeben ich mag den Feminismus nicht mehr. Ich will zwar das Frauen gleiche Rechte haben, aber auch nicht mehr als das. Ich fände es sogar noch gerecht wenn Frauen eine Prämie für eine vollendete Geburt bekommen würden aber ansonsten finde ich dass Frauen zu viel Aufmerksamkeit bekommen."
Wozu me too? Wegen scheidentrockenheit?
Wenn alle einfach gendern würden gäbe es quasi keine Ungleichheit auf der Welt😂
"Schon klar, die Freiheit…
Nein Danke Arte!"
😂😂 ich kann nur noch lachen.
"Eine Gesellschaft kann einem auch den Mund verbieten da diese ihre Faselei und Bluberei als alleinige Formgebung der Materie versteht, was an sich gegen jede Gleichstellung ist da andere auch den ganzen Tag Buchstabenrätsel machen wo jedes mal andere Wort heraus kommen, welche genau so gut in den Pot passen wie all das momentane Gefasel auch.  Und wenn dann bestimmt Kreaturen aus den regierenden Kreisen noch einen vom Jobs erzählen, müssten im Grunde alle Alarmglocken läuten da wir diesen selbstverständlich im großen Buchstabenrätsel "" Werfs in Töpfchen"" für andere die Jobs erledigen könnten. Siehe den Begriff JAGUAUARS die neuen Jumper von Planeten Pumper."
Auf dem Spiel steht der sogenannte Hausverstand.

當初麥克傑克森也是被人誣告性侵兒童，造成他服藥過量而死，我記得國小的時候只有三台，但媒體就喜歡暗示麥克傑克森有戀童僻、皮膚是漂白的等等黑幕，我那時候有都相信了。
"恭喜🎉他。
Metoo有罪應罰，但也有人想用metoo達成嘩眾取寵甚至脅迫。"
讓無辜的人背負罪名 確實很慘 可放走一個性侵犯 促使更多受害者  不也是不人道嗎
沒有証據，光是口頭証據，無法定罪，很多時候有証據，壞人一樣不承認何況無証據，只能說天知地知 你知我知！
me too最大受害人...世紀大冤種
本來就沒有
老天爺知道，如果他真的正直，與其相處的人會說正直，不是自然不是。沒人想和“被侵害或性騷”扯上關係或貼上此類標籤，又不是什麼好的，臭水溝就是臭水溝，他如再犯遲早會遇到鬼。
"yeah, Lgbtq support insistance, lack of respect for elders, etc  all seem to go together."
This woman should be in jail
Almost as if false accusations would run rampant if the accused are not given due process
Prosecute false allegations to the fullest extent of the law
He is innocent. These women should be charged. They ruined this mans' career.
False accusers need to be punished as harshly as actual rapists..
"I love the ""Power Imbalance"" line. These women are lined up around the block to sleep with him but it's a power imbalance."
How can anyone write and talk about it in the media and publicly without any proof??? Horror society we live in.
"A true journalist doing his job! Thank you, sir!"
Sounds like defamation to me
This is sad and so wrong.  It’s unforgivable men are being vilified and punished by mere allegations without a shred of evidence.  So wrong!  I hope Armie can come back and would love to see him prevail.
Johnny Depp was the only Hollywood type to push back thus far
"Effie is taking away from REAL VICTIMS.  She has also destroyed an actor because he didn't make her a priority.  She also disrespected a married woman (Elizabeth Chambers), and will eventually end up hurting Armie's children.  They will read all this one day.  She is SELFISH.  She's right out of FATAL ATTRACTION."
Is time for these women start facing  accountability for destroying people lives
The Hammer Dude needs to fight back and sue don’t know any of them but this is insane
"I'm so sad for Armie, it's terrible what happened to him"
Yet women LOVE 50 shades of grey
"This was an adult discussion. I've had friends cheat on their spouses in the worst way. But none of them became unemployable after it. The more I hear/ read, it does sound like impressionable women who wanted the thrill of being with a celebrity they had admired from their cinema seat, went along with intimate things that after the relationship ended, they regretted. But regretting something consensual is free : it should not have a cost to someone else. In my experience, everyone has a kink. Some little thing that really floats their boat. To society at large, it might seem silly, disgusting, hard to understand. For some, the kink may be a little bit more unusual that most people's. But that is no reason to shame them. It comes down to whether the notoriously uptight American public would pay to see Hammer in something. If they will, the producers will come knocking. But it may take a lawsuit along the lines of the one pursued by Johnny Depp against his accuser, to finally draw a line under the defamation he's currently experiencing. The people in this video are correct : the accusers should press charges. The authorities obviously don't think there is a criminal case to answer. So they should take their chance in the civil court, where a lower standard of proof applies ( eg balance of probabilities ). They don't because they know they would lose. Therefore, ""on the balance of probabilities"", he did nothing wrong."
She probably thought he would leave his wife for her then he dumped her so she ruined his career. Even if not true she would benefit. With an out of court settlement to stop her lies. I know from experience that if they can’t have you they will burn down the world around you.
This guy is brave for trying to make bed hair a fashion statement.
Me too is still around? I thought it was finished after Alyssa Milllano left in humiliation.
"But believe all women, right?"
I don't know which I like more; His hair or Armie Hammer's name.
Canceled Hollywood should just all move to Texas and Florida and make a studios. Make it like Hollywood in the 80s! 😅
"Is the accuser a jilted woman? And taking it out on the accused with false allegations? Many women defer to men's wishes in hopes to keep them. It's possible she was reluctantly willing, but willing none the less."
How he has handled the accusations and the disgrace has been very impressive. Going back to work even if not in his field and showing the women who accused him so much respect in interviews even if they don’t deserve it. What a man! Very well raised.
"In all fairness, I can see why some people would be uncomfortable with cannibalism and not want to work one."
Why don’t they give them lie detector tests or the new brain scanning that can tell the truth? (which shouldn’t be used against citizens it should be used for criminal complaints and government employees).
"If you want to talk about Armie Hammer, first what you should do is to read the James Kirchick article about the whole ""scandal"", because he is the only qualified journalist who has done his job honestly and professionaly, and who had brought the truth on the daylight, by using the evidence, and nothing but evidence, without taking sides. All the others, with no exception, are delivering just one side of the story, including the so called documentary ""House of Hammer"", which is discriminating Armie Hammer, his parents, and his family."
Why doesn't he sue for slander and defamation?
"I'm so pleased even the left is going to draw the line at voicing possibly considering cannibalism and just "" kink shame "" until proven otherwise ."
Of course We want Armie Hammer to comeback as an actor. His really doing a good job. ❤❤❤
It must be nice to have an obscenely rich family to pay for this kind of reputation recovery in the media.  The guys own words are disturbing enough we don't want him around.
He needs to sue her.
"Reporter: I find it odd that she describes such a violent 4 hour encounter, with him having such little use of his dominate limb.

Bri: well he’s 6’5 and strong and grape is not always physical…

Ma’am what??"
You mean the Lone Ranger didn't really eat all those ladies?!
Sorry buddy. Money like that can give you whatever proof they want you to believe.
"2:30 Cannibalism fetishes unlike BDSM do sound crazy, unless they are purely in the fantasy domain."
This guys hair is too much!! I can't pay attention to what he's saying 😑
Why is The King from Hamilton the newsreader here?
Sound seems off - high pitched
Sounds like a Johnny Depp case!
"As a woman, I don’t GAF what Armie Hammer enjoys in the bedroom. Leave people alone.

I’m more curious about his name. Is that his real name? It’s so weird. Makes me think of Arm and Hammer baking soda."
wait till you hear what he did with baking soda
"I appreciate the reporting. Not sure if he'll be back. I've never been impressed by his acting chops, which he probably got based off of family, connections, and good looks."
I think it’s ok to kink shame cannibals. I’m just saying.
Isn't fantasizing out loud about cooking and eating women a deal breaker?
I really hope he can sue all of these weirdos and the producers from that defamatory documentary that wanted to link his liking for Secretary for being pr3dat0ry
"I'm not okay with him convincing a young woman to have her body violated for his own selfish purpose (getting off). Same with cutting his initial into her body.  (Paige Lorenze- who has NOT come after Armie, just told her story and did say she consented but was made to feel like BDSM was ""normal"") How about we don't do this to teens and young 20-year olds. It's despicable."
Didn’t people also claim he was into cannibalism?
No different than the Trevor Bauer case. She wanted everything she got and he gets suspended for 2 years and probably gonna be black balled from the mlb all because this girl wanted some metoo clout
Sadly presumed guilty
Jeeeezuz chroist!!! What a mess! And Me Too overplayed their hand
"I was under the impression that BDSM wasn't bad, it's just a kink - and that the community thereof was really serious about consent."
If he was a Democrat like Joe & Bill this would go away in 24 hours.
What about David grusch?
"Humans eat every other sentient being on the planet without hesitation or consideration of compassion, why not each other? We are not special, folks. We cause all the problems."
My impression is that Hammer sounds very guilty.
"Ehhhh idk BDSM shouldn’t result in extreme injuries and trauma if it’s done by two consenting adults who established boundaries in the act. And the cannibalism claim is craaaaazy! Idk who would lie about that. And yea it’s easy to claim people can file charges but who’s about to compete with money. If these alleged victims don’t have the same resources to do court filings, to get lawyers to take time off to fight it in court, it’s really going to be hard and sometimes women make claims but due to the nature of the crime who’s involved or lack of evidence the victims get advised to drop or forget about pressing charges (it’s illegal but they still do it). The cannibalism alone should have him in a psych ward."
Go back and watch your coverage of this. She's obviously lying.
Why does Earz talk that way?
Look at the Rug on that guys head lol
"I just watched ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E""  Arrest him for that Russian accent."
"Read his story, very weird life!!!"
"Question one, was Hammer a non Biden voter? That has been the type of tactics they use on all enemies. Woke Justice 😥"
Women lying to gain power? Oh my who would have every guessed that. Believe women....lol ok
Why so serial?
"0:01
Who is she?"
This guy doesn't own a comb?
who do you work Brianna?  Have you no shame?
Never heard of him...
Armie Hammer is his real name?
They should bring back Weinstein and make him a studio head again the new movies are s***
I'm trying not to focus on his hair
On standby
All the people in the comments that don't believe this woman. The exact same people who ran to defend Tara Reade's allegations. I don't believe Reade not one but
"He's a cannibal, right? Oh, no. That was just a fantasy. Ahhh, whatever: He's a cannibal."
Lets go back to the oj trial.   Adrenaline can make some people super men
"Hard to say. But it sure sounds like he’s being railroaded. 

That said- while I am generally a pretty kink- friendly guy- his are a bit much for me."

"Difference between Armie and Louis CK is that Louis was not a Hollywood creation and he did not owe his career to a small group of Hollywood gatekeepers. Armie does, so he is finished."
who arm & hammer
I dont trust this journalist with that haircut... at all....
cannibal kink?
I feel no sympathy for these liberals
"The two of you have no, roddery it seems like the black lady hates you and you hate her the two of you do not pair up well"
"Sir, you're on TV.  You knew you would be. Comb your hair!"
But he is an alleged cannibal...
Omg don't fall for it not the hill... They are not false accusers if his wife left him and his family disowned him. He has cannibalistic obsessions and he is a very dangerous man. 😳
He’s a twisted man
Believe all clients.
I thought he ate someone.  Did that not happen?  He should probably be cancelled if he ate someone.
It's not clear why 400 years of jurisprudence and administration of justice should be abandoned in the face of an online campaign. Allegations without evidence are the road to ever greater injustices.
"I developed a healthy paranoia about the “crime” of being at the wrong place at wrong time, and it’s saved me many times.  My first experience was as a 15 year old paper boy in the late 1970s and having four young girls screaming at me “he’s the one! He’s the one!” And finally the single apparently alcoholic mother coming out onto the street to scream accusations at a very terrified me, not knowing what I had done, and trying to figure it out.  I was guilty as charged and in today’s society I would have been arrested no doubt.

Weeks later I happen to look out the window of my house and see a kid who had the same nose, skin tone and hair colour, and so quickly ran after him to confirm if it was him and what had happened.  It turned out it related to some vulgar language he and a friend used against the girls but imagine if it was worse?

Several such experiences led to an instinctual practice of awareness around the misjudgments of people, and I have a long list of examples where my practice of “situational self defence” has saved me. People can lie even when they don’t know it, can misjudge and reinterpret, and me too was terrifying, for example, I had a professor friend who admitted that she didn’t care if the odd innocent guy got caught up in me too, and I thought what have we come to…"
Medieval times people were executed upon a mere allegation 🤷‍♂️
"The medical profession has a ethos of ‘do no further harm’ in its approach to medical treatment.  The ‘believe all woman’ approach to this crime; while intended to support victims will (has / is having) also result in inflicting untold damage on people who have not actually committed crimes but are stigmatised and financially ruined through the need to defend themselves against a demonstrative false allegation.  What seemed to be lost is an understanding there is actually no disincentive (in this country) to acting unethically in the extension of an sexual assaults allegation.  An accuser can be totally anonymous, shoulders no financial burden of the legal process and is rarely, if ever, held to account if the accusation of found to be false.  None of these safeguards  are extended to the accused.  I fully understand that I say this in the context where sexual assaults do happen and traumatise victims, however in attempting to support such people implementing systems that results in the traumatisation of people who are not guilty of crimes is actually causing additional trauma, not reducing it."
Not saying it’s the equivalent-but at the end of every November I immediately ‘believe’ in Santa. (…not as analogous 🤷🏻‍♂️)
😂😂😂😂. Believe all men 😂😂😂
What exactly is “medieval” about it?
Bw
"""Pound me too"" is not a good slogan either..."
"Why wasn't he faithful to his wife, a wife knows her husband, because we have intuition"

"When I see a young black person at a bar, I immediately apologize, then buy them a beer, and preemptively quit my job. It’s the only decent thing to do."
"My father, who ran DADS Canada is featured in a York University textbook as an example of misogyny for saying publicly that women who falsely accuse men of rape should face jail time."
"I hope John is able to lawyer up and sue the company that fired him for literally no reason, zero proof!"
"At a minimum, her lawyers should be disbarred for hiding exculpatory evidence from the defendant's lawyers."
"The woman should be imprisoned for life and have to pay Trevor millions.  It's DISGUSTING what she did.  
If she is not imprisoned she  should be completely ostracized from society."
Another woke company that I can put on  my boycott list.  Thank you North Face
"Even if he bought him a beer, that would've proved his guilt, in the black racist eyes. This was a no win for John.😑"
So this tactic of “buy me something or I’ll call you racist” is basically this guy’s business strategy as well as a “brand ambassador”.
People who are caught falsely accusing someone should get life in prison. Always
"If her attorneys are not permanently disbarred for withholding evidence, then I don't see any hope for our justice system."

Time to boycott NORTHFACE!! COMPLETELY SHUT IT DOWN.....
BOYCOTT NORTH FACE NOW!
"I'm almost equally as mad at him for not suing her and just ""getting it over with."" He's right, it's not about the money. It's about sending a message."
Im so glad Trevor is not giving her anything. She deserves prison.
"I think it's one of the worst we know about it.  Imagine how many celebrities this has happened to, but gave into blackmail & paid out their false accusers.  The bravery it took Trevor to stand up for himself even though it cost him his career & millions of dollars astonishes me."
"If there were consequences, scandalous women as such would think twice before doing this. Absolutely disgusting."
"So, if I say, ""I am a racist"", does that mean that I'm not?
If not, then I'm a racist no matter what I say.
Might as well just BE a racist."
"Two simple ways to protect yourself from these types of things, gents. One, don’t go around sticking your crank in random pigs, there are plenty of nice girls out there but take the time to find them. Two, don’t go around talking to strangers, just hang out with your friends, I mean how many people do you really need to know anyways?"
Scott Adams is right.
Scott Adams is sounding smarter every day.
"""Buy me a beer, or I ruin your career."""

"With these people, anything said or done that fails to meet their standards for approval will be defined as racism. My last boss was like that and she was a middle aged, white female."
Not only these kind of women but also their lawyers should be held accountable und punished!
That broad should be in jail.
"[2:50]  This ""brand ambassador"" is so articulate."
The North Face used to be a good company with quality outerwear. Sad.
We need to start prosecuting people who destroy peoples lives based on lies.
Perhaps that Dilbert writer had a point in maybe choosing to avoid those that obviously hate you or want to hurt you in some way because you look different racially. Sadly.
"The guy didn't even explain what happened, no detail, not a single thing this supposed racist actually said. I'm so tired of the English language being reduced to a bunch of sentence fragments and  slang words. Not to mention words being misused or each individual choosing what they want the definition of a word to be. Even the most basic communication is breaking down. If everyone applies their own definitions to words and ignores basic grammar we have no language. It's sad to see and reminds me of the movie Idiocracy: ""the English language had been reduced to a mixture of slang terms and grunts"""
"Just think of all the ""Me Too"" scams we are not even hearing about..............."
"I remember reluctantly passing up a complaint from one of my team to my boss. He said ""Give me dates, times, quotes in writing, signed, AND witnesses. Otherwise, don't bother me."" Seems those standards of management are gone but I hope they come back."
A pitcher for the yankees punched his significant other in front of an executive for MLB and even he wasn't given anywhere near the amount of punishment and hate that Bauer got
"her face is so slappable, her parents must be so proud of her."
"I was propositioned by my ex the other day.  She's emotionally unbalanced and is just the type to concoct a scheme like this.  I said no thank you.  It's possible to let the head on your shoulders stay in charge, guys."
Guess I won’t be buying North Face brand.
meetoo is a weapon for cancelling men women don't like
"Should have said, ""I refuse to pay a dime and not only that, by the end of this I am 100% confident that she is going to owe me and my attorney's a lot of money. They are offering me settlement agreements. Nope - I am going to be doing the offering of settlement agreements, and the price will get higher every single day."""
"Always with the ""racism"" with these people....  it gets tiring.  Call it out for what it is.  Never apologize, never cave, never give an inch."
File complaining against the lawyers who is  representing her so they can lose their license to practice
As soon as someone claims racism i ignore them
you will never catch me wearing that brand...
"The lesson for all men from Trevor Bauer is to not be promiscuous, to not be in rooms alone with strange women, to generally not associate with strange women on ANY level, no matter the temptation. If you want your ""reputation"" to be intact and above reproach don't subject it to a sexually promiscuous lifestyle where these accusations can get a toehold, don't be your own worst enemy."
"I feel for the REAL victims of abuse who can't speak up of their experiences. These scammers should be punished!

EDIT: I am not invalidating the experience of people who lost their everything after being falsely accused. It is a horrible experience indeed. I am just saying that because of these scammers, some of the victims of abuse may have a hard time speaking up because others may not believe them anymore because of these scammers who report false accusations."
"As much as I despise women like this, men have some responsibility in cases like this too. When a woman sadly gets raped whilst out jogging at 4am, people have sympathy but at the same time wonder why they were out at 4am alone. I wonder why when men who are worth a lot of money sleep about with just anyone, when they have a lot to protect and these type of allegations are sadly common nowadays. Whilst I have sympathy for this man, she looks the type, and I say that as a woman. These women need to be punished but at the same time rich men need to grow some common sense and not put themselves at risk of such allegations."
"I don't interact with these people and I warn my kids about them. If one of them tries to engage with you, make an excuse and get away as fast as you can. Everything they touch is ruined."
"I had a girl one time punch me in the head about 4 times, and i proceeded to leave and told her she was psycho. The next day, i came home from work and the police were there and arrested me for domestic violence. I went to jail all weekend, and they set my bond to 30,000 dollars. i paid over 3,000 dollars to get out, and they put me on gps monitoring. i had to go report once a week for urine tests. Well, 3 months later, the charges were dropped after i proved my  innocence. And nothing happened to her, and i lost my job and everything. The justice system is broken in this country."
What about Matt Araiza? Rising punter for the Bills. he didn't have 51 million in his bank and still had his career derailed.
The North Face's 'Ambassador' was drunk. 💯
Every single accuser needs a polygraph.
"In the Old Testament, if you falsely accused someone and it was discovered, you’d get the punishment you were hoping the person would get. This is necessary to deter these types of things. Modern day legal systems should learn from that."
"Cutting off isn't always intentional. When someone pauses for a few seconds, sometimes I think they are done and start responding, but they are actually about to say another sentence. I have autism and this is a problem I encounter weekly."
"Why is the DA or a prosecutor not trying to put her in prison?? This is evil, this women is evil and belongs in prison!
Where is the liberal, leftist, woke main street media?? Why are they not asking these questions?? Is it because it doesn’t fit their agendas?
We want justice! We want this women prosecuted."
"That BM Made absolutely no sense when he was rambling on and on 🙄""I"" Would have walked away! I had no idea what he was talking about! It's like he was looking to start something....so he just male up something, like ppl who make up lies and gossip. Also I like how Trevor took responsibility for being friends with the wrong ppl, because unfortunately it does happen."
"This is sad being a level headed black man now, I truly hope everyone knows that we all don’t act like this idiot. I actually love to meet new people and new personalities. Tragic that people treat innocent, kind hearted humans that mean no harm like this"
"Oh no! I had a job interview today, and the hiring manager happened to be a Black man...I shook his hand before *and* after the interview..did I do a racist?"
"I was never a huge Trevor Bauer fan even before the accusations. However, he was one hell of a pitcher, and probably deserved all the success that he got, and it’s a shame that one sick evil woman took all that away from him."
The Dodgers ownership is very strongly left leaning including the disgraceful tans/Nuns being honored on the field recently... Bauer was a known conservative and a Trump supporter.... ooops not a good thing to be these days if you want a career or a monetized youtube channel.
Just a friendly suggestion to everyone... don't have casual sex with strangers and you're more likely to avoid this type of thing.
"The way the guy was sweeping his hair, i figured that it was a gay cat fight"
"As long as the false accuser pay no consequences, this sort of story will keep happening."
I live in MT and we got a lotta “these people” suddenly showing up here since about 2020. I love it!
"""Brand Ambassador"" is about the most useless  title any company can toss their money away on. All it's done for them from me personally, is add yet another company to the list I will NEVER spend a dime on anything from."
"Men need to stop being promiscuous. Raise the bar on your own body and sexuality as much as you do when seeking for a wife with 0 “body count”. This isn’t being petty regarding men-women relationships. This could save your body from diseases, your mental health, and even your life. There’s nothing wrong with men who want to abstain from sexual relationships before marriage out of self respect and to avoid a lifetime of nonsense like this. Thank God there were no children involved in all that mess."
"We now live in a society dominated by “professional victims”. Every time I look on the internet someone is crying foul about they were offended, SA’d, or some other bs allegations. It’s so sad and pathetic. These people have such deep seeded resentment against anyone that doesn’t look like them, or is more successful that they will do whatever it takes to take them down or “get the bag”. These people should have been swallowed"
Women who lie about rape should get as much time as the rapist would get.
These news companies should be charged. False rape accusers should be imprisoned and fined for double the prison cost and be publicly shamed and required to register as a false accuser.
It's a good sign that he can still work in Japan - at least one country hasn't gone mad yet
And as a mother of two boys this kind of stuff scares me to death.   I have repeatedly told them both to be extremely careful because consent in the heat of passion can turn into a rape allegations the next morning.   Men can be completely honest about it being just a hookup and and the woman will just agree that she's on the same page but later decide that she was raped.  It's absolutely disgusting.
I try to steer clear of any privileged or protected demographic. It’s not worth the risk that they’ll take something wrong or even that I’ll say something wrong. The consequences of engaging them far outweigh the benefits.
"This is why I don't talk to random black people. I was walking down a sidewalk in L.A. when a black dude coming towards me said ''hi'', as we both kept walking. after several paces he turned around and yelled, ''Hey, I said hi to you!''  Me, the ''white exploiter'', turned around looked at him, & kept walking. I don't feel guilty."
Women who falsely accuse men of rape should receive the same prison term as men who actually commit rape.
The take I got is to stay away from woman and definitely don't sleep with randos.  Your future self will thank you.
The recent attempt against Rammstein and Till Lindemann backfired brilliantly. I think they are suing the accuser last time I read. More victims of need to sue!
Northface race-baiter/grifter is crazy
I'm so tired of accusations becoming public then they are found guilty in public opinion and loose their careers before the accusations are actually proven true or false! These trash women need to be held accountable!
"The corrupt lawyer should be disbarred for going along with the rape hoax and he should be on the hook for the legal fees.

The woman hoaxer should be jailed 15-20 years."
"You give him too much credit, Matt. The story is: _""A white guy talked to me.""_ That's it. That's the entire story."
"Making a declaration of racism and accussing someone of sterotyping you while not bothering to turn off the rap music.....
I dont know why that makes me laugh"
Perpetual victimhood syndrome
"Was needing a new fleece, passing on North Face and will buy Columbia."
Stop dealing with these people ALWAYS.
"My cat Fred has gone into hiding over the ""Me Too."""
"Trevor needs to get better lawyers.  If he honestly has proof that her team knowingly withheld evidence that not only proves his innocence, but also her guilt and lying under oath, it shouldnt be too difficult to go after her, her team, and the MLB."
"????????
Would someone explain exactly what this guy actually said? I am litteraly dumber for listening to that Unabomber wannabe!"
"As for Trevor, part of the pitfalls of the hook up culture."
This is one of the reasons why I don't talk to people!
This man must resign until the fair and transparent investigation is done
I agree with the analysis and happy you mentioned there are other sports other than Cricket. WFI president should resign and guilty must be punished.
This is the culture of BJP. He will come clean after going through the BJP  washing machine
"If this is Ram rajya, then there should be Ravanas surpanakha characters also. So these fellows are role-playing of those characters."

Any culprit has to be tried and given suitable punishment.
Such a coward p.m ...he doesn't speak up whenever there is gross injustice against women...
"WFI president and the coaches who have  exploited the female athletes should be put behind bars, why is Modiji so helpless, beti bacho a big question mark"
He should be arrested immediately
Why is P.M silent?
Politicians is always politician irrespective of Parties. Either BJP nor congress nor other parties. This our political parties system it the election commission or Supreme court or President of India has to harsh to punish them life term and suspend them so other should feel scared of doing.
There are a lot of officials in the BJP who have a record of sexual harassment. These people take refuge from the law by joining this party.
He should have been kicked out but bjp govt want this type of leaders to harras
"This news is disgustingly  stupid.  If he has molested you , get together  and thrash  him , why complain, aaj tak kisi ne aise complain suni hai . Women show courage and fight don't complain.  Kuch nahin hoga."
"Quite a mild news coverage, seems this YT channel is downplaying the incident !"
बेटी बचाओ बीजेपी से
"Get the gallows ready, this is not my idea. I'm just implementing what Brijbhushan wants."
All bjp MPs are above all above all laws. They can open emergency flight door do anything with   girls.
Brij Bhushan is a pious man  let's have an investigation and he will come clean
"And….they go down, eventually. Here for it! This is not about cancel culture. Cancel culture is about getting rid of people who disagree with your beliefs. Brand is disgusting on all levels. Brand outting was only a matter of time. So, so good!"
Is she... is she drunk?
求償一千萬，讓人覺得仗勢欺人？難怪會引眾怒…
想用一千萬嚇唬大牙，另外堵住下一位爆料者，結果反而一個個跳出來，這就是欺人太甚的下場。
NONO太離譜。連道歉都沒有，難怪會被告…感覺上最有可能被關的就是他…
团结就是力量！所有被性骚性侵的受害者本来就不应该独自面对一切，而是该个个勇敢地站出来指证性侵犯，别让他继续危害其他女生并且让他得到应得的惩罚！加油！

發生在老婆懷孕期間才是最噁心的...
黑人當你入獄時別忘了、帶一條、、黑人牙膏、洗淨你滿身罪惡感
黑人提告民事訴訟，激活了強制猥褻罪，公訴案被激活了！黑人一定會進監獄坐牢，關久一點以杜絕藉權力進行性騷擾的霸凌事件一再發生。
有能力的人不代表、就可以欺侮任何人、有老婆的人了、這樣對嗎？

姚恵珍女士的頭髪是否看起來很奇怪⁇既然出鏡、是否該關心一下自己的髪形？
黑人趕緊逃離台湾帶著范范到非洲过日子吧、不然要关十年哦！😂😂😂
只有一個原因：想紅
我支持要嚴查黑人、但絕對反對叫中國國台辦干預我們台灣內部司法案件！因為黑人陳建州畢竟是我們自己台灣人、再壞也是我們自己台灣的小孩、自己的孩子不乖自己教訓、豈有叫外人來打自己小孩的道理!? 一旦叫中國介入，這不等於間接承認中國對我們台灣有管轄權限!? 這豈不成了台灣版的「送中」了 ? 除非黑人是在中國犯事，接受中國律法處理；不然事件發生在台灣，當然全由台灣司法來處理、怎可教唆聯合外人來欺負管教自家的孩子呢!?  台灣守護自己台灣人的立場，以及台灣自己國家的獨立司法皆嚴重受損；更會給國際看笑話啊！
大渣男
黑人用法律捍衛自己的權利，覺得被大牙栽贓誣衊，錯在哪裏？
古人真有智慧，善有善報，惡有惡報，不是不報，時候未到。大小S和相關人仕生時進監獄，死後下地獄。

"Je suis d’accord que la justice n’est évidemment pas les médias, mais dans un pays où seulement 0,6% des violes donnent lieu à une condamnation ne devrions-nous pas aux moins les reconnaître coupables par l’opinion publique ? Devrions-nous les laisser tranquilles alors même qu’ils ont était accusé de viole ? Devrions-nous remettre en cause ce que dit la victime ? Le viole est un crime mais la victime ne devrait elle pas avoir au moins le droit de voir son violeur discrédité par les médias ?"

謝謝律師把方法教出來
職場性騷，如果當時講出來，不一定有人信，通常會丟了工作，加害者甚至會反咬一口，說是妳自願的，受害者還可能在業界被封殺，誰敢說，男女永遠都不可能平等，尤其在職場上
這當下不出處理.過了9年.我覺得正義不會來了....
就是當下怕失業就一直不敢說出口。
這些很難想像
職場人多好自保的了嗎?
這些披著洋毛的狼，我相信曾小姐所說的，因為很多認識的朋友都被職場性騷擾，你們這些爛人會有報應的，趕緊認罪悔改吧
自己沒責任？

不是深刻反省，是只想躲在家裡吧?請站出來，一件一件交代清楚，且將財產拿出來，針對受害人，給予做精神賠償心理治療的費用，看以後誰還敢不尊重他人。
今年真是一個令人難過的年？有沒有想過被害人每一年都很難過？
直接入監了 10多人指認不是開玩笑的
敢性侵，性騷擾，就敢對自己負責，受害人一定要提告，絕不容許惡行持續擴大！！！！！！！
被揭發才斷尾求生，很會阿😂！
他是這波算最嚴重的
不是老人癡呆都沒有印象嗎，怎麼現在又要停止工作了，還是昨天吃深海魚油想起來了，你都不怕你女兒長大以後遇到像你這種色狼嗎，人在做天在看逃得過初一躲不過十五
這是性侵欸，道歉有用？
"NONO關閉FB留言 深怕被罵翻 洗版  沒道歉 只在FB 簡單聲明 
到底是啥 力量 給你 膽大妄為 膽大包天 性騷 性侵 這麼多女性 最小年紀才15歲
NONO 你 都不怕 自己造的業障 會報在自己的 親人 老婆 女兒身上嗎？
整個演藝圈 真的 誇張到極致 真的無言 
不知 下一個 接棒者 會是誰 (me too)"
老婆小孩都要背負著是性侵犯的家人。你送她們很好的禮物。讓她們有這樣的頭銜。以後女兒同學的家長會叫小孩不要跟你女兒玩。怕你的魔抓會申到小孩身上。在跟小孩說我是不是很大。  光想孩子班上有這樣的家長就覺得可怕
慘了......這還是在婚後發生的
賺夠了 爽夠了 退了有差嗎？
"超噁，我納悶的是他老婆不可能沒有耳聞吧? 這麼多受害者我不相信不會傳到他老婆耳裡。
如爆料屬實，NONO的行為是犯罪行為，性騷和性侵，如果老婆知情還默許，那不是大方可以解釋的，根本是加害者。"
「強制性交罪的法定刑，是3年以上10年以下的有期徒刑，所以依法他的追溯期是20年，這件事這個是非告訴乃論，所以他(檢方)知道犯罪的情況，他們可以主動去偵辦，如果有人去提告以後，他們會先傳喚被害人過來說明到案做筆錄。」依照法律規定，如果NONO真的被告，或涉嫌犯下強制性交等罪，光是追訴期就有20年，除了最重可判處10年有期徒刑，如果20名被害人所述都定罪，一罪一罰合併執行的話，最重可能面臨30年刑期，而且被害人中甚至還有未成年少女！！！！！
我已經無法拿正眼看(演藝人員）了.....
原本說的“沒印象” 實在太幽默了！ 不愧是邪星！
真是所謂出來混早晚要還的。
權力不平等之強迫，這跟當初林女士寫的房思琪有異曲同工啊....省什麼錯認了嗎?
沒被爆出來，就繼續傷害女性，做卑鄙下流齷齪的是！
完了！這樣天才衝衝衝會不會快沒來賓了😢😢
乃哥說的是真的😢
"今年是業障爆發年

"I can't think of anything more destructive to men, women and family is porn. Just because it's common doesn't mean it's normal. The lie that ""all men do it"" needs to be crushed."
Kudos Megyn for speaking out hard against porn and its damage… great guest 💪🏼👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I attribute nearly every social woe in our culture to fatherlessness. I don’t know how we can begin to recover from this condition.
Strong independent women “we don’t need no man”.  Men “OK”.
"The MeToo movement has hurt women more than men.  From a man’s point of view, the risk is just too great, and women end up alone. Men end up alone too, but are better equipped."
So glad I grew up in 80's & 90's.
"I couldn’t SURVIVE a mere 30 seconds in today’s colleges!  I hit it at the  perfect time!  I saw a quote “in the 1980’s we wondered what 2020 was like, in 2020’s,….they want to return to the 1980’s!!!”"
"It’s not that hard but our society is crazy.  I had no problem when I was a kid but that was in the sixties and seventies.   My dad a world war 2 veteran, taught me and my two brothers in how to be a man.  Real men are tough  but loving.  We aren’t push overs but we put our wife and family first."
Amen brother!!!
"A big one is just get off the internet. People are so paranoid what might be said about them online or visit a person's online profile to the point of obsession and resulting negative emotions.

Honestly, all my luck changed when I started going to line dancing at a local country bar with a mindset of just having something to do and meeting women being a nice side bonus (otherwise you put women on a pedestal and that's not healthy). Line dancing is easy to learn and really rewarding the more you go and learn and you feel so cool when you finally figure out a dance. People there are way nicer, more wholesome than a usual night club, and are more than willing to help others learn (plus most country clubs have lessons). I don't particularly like country music but it's growing on me now and I've never had an easier time meeting women. Give it a shot."
What if the social media never existed in first place? Will this issue solved without it? I hope I could turn back the time around.
Protestant Christian Faith is our only and best hope
"It’s not just about young men.  As with all things women and men are in this world together, to help each other.  Mothers have forgotten how to instruct their daughters on being young ladies."
I pray this man's book ROCKS our culture!! ❤🙏✝️
"I went to high school at a school with very few women. Then when I went to college my college had about 8 guys for every girl. I found it very difficult to find dating partners because I was competing for a small pool of women, this didn’t allow me to form flood friendships because I wasn’t thinking that way. So since I didn’t have any experience, I came off as desperate and creepy despite me not trying to be. I didn’t find success in this area until I got in the real world. 

I like that Megyn frames everything in non religious terms, which I feel is very important. While her guest shared her views on this, he kept using religion in his arguments, which isn’t going to win a lot of people over. On the right, the other two people who are good at using non religion arguments on social issues are Rachel Bovard and Emily Jashinsky, the later of course is a frequent guest on this podcast."
Wwho is going to keep these young man out of jail and prison ? Do ya'll not see that these people will stop at nothing to take away any male masculinity ? Im scared for all these boys and men .
Romance between a Man and a Woman is the deliberate effort of constant growth learning about one another with unconditional loving acceptance through consideration between the Husband and Wive relationship producing highest values when two become one loving  FULFILLMENT of life's rich abundance by procreation given to us by God Almighty.
"I'm not the person to go to for coaching on how to talk to girls, don't put that evil on me. Most women are enigmas to me."
I love this lady. As a man I feel like this has been going on for the past few years. I feel like it's equally damaging to everyone tbh. You have women who had things happen to then and get these girls that throw smoke signals with no fire. That makes it harder and puts a bad stigma af a liar on actual victims of domestic violence and abuse. Then as a man I pick and choose carefully the women you ask out or say something too although I'll more than likely never allow a person to make me ashamed of something like that but the fact is that it's in the back of your mind you will get rejected not because you're unattractive but because women have been taught to hate men and condesend them any chance you get.
Not to mention this is probably why so many men now want to be “women”.
I went monk in 2016. Best decision I ever made.
"And, Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus is the greatest go-to guide to understand the sexes!  Things like women need to talk about problems and men seek solutions to problems for example."
IMO porn is destructive because it’s addictive and you need consistently more extreme versions to maintain the same level of arousal. A “normal” relationship with an actual person becomes boring.
"The definition of sexual harassment has to be reassessed.  It's gone from actual legitimate harassment, ie threatening a job unless a sex act is performed to being canceled for making a dumb d+×k joke."
"Whenever matriarchal flavor intensifies in a society, it dies. The mayans died out becuz of that. Whatever mayan survived ended up melting inside other societies.
The father figure as leadership found inside the relics of history indicates life. 
Feminism indicates boredom of an empire's apogee.

The soldier runs 25 km, and falls on the floor exhausted. A nurse picks him up, and carries him on her back."
This man’s religiosity is way over the top
"Isn't anger about how pornographers use both women and men supposed to be part of the Me Too movement too? Anger about how pornographers are dictating to everybody what allegedly cool in bed looks like. Some women and men at age 18 just aren't interested in imitating them outside of marriage when we women too should be working to establish ourselves in our work so that we can support a child before getting pregnant. People, both women and men who can wait uintil marriage end up being better off."
"I think the men/boys need a man perspective is complex. As a GenX female, growing up boys were aggressive because men were aggressive and that was what some, if not most, saw from their fathers. It was part of that bad cycle. On the other hand, I call my brothers pushovers because they grew up with strong women around them. Yes, I grew up with my father in the house my entire childhood but he wasn’t a good example for me or the boys. 

I’ll go one step further and admit, as a girl, I was exposed to to p0rn at a young age but after promiscuity in my teens because of childhood sexual abuse, I am now asexual."
"4:30 I have to be honest, what he describes here doesn't sound bad. I'll add one more - when she decides to divorce you (turn the computer off), you don't have to give up half of your stuff."
"Not just Internet porn. This started with all those games that young young boys, and I think I believe young girls years ago. Their parents bought every kind of game to play online and there were secret messages being sent throughout those games the women were dressed very sexually, the men were, they didn’t represent a real man and a real woman and small children were playing these games, and I believe that because men and women had to work, this was almost like their babysitter but it was with all these games it was so so wrong so nasty I’ve seen it firsthand what it has done to kids and they think that’s what the world looks like and it doesn’t but their parents don’t put the time and energy. They’re they’re tired they’ve worked all day to actually sit down and tell them this is not how it’s supposed to be and don’t buy them these trashy pornography games because they’re pushing pornography through every child’s game that they play on the Internet Internet."
It was interesting hearing them discuss men's and women's hair. I wonder if Megyn regrets when she chopped hers off. I personally thought it looked awful when she did that and love her hair now. It was just an interesting thought.
"Megyn is a blessing, love listening to her to get my daily updates going on"
"nice to see a refreshing outlook from Megyn about men, i hate metoo.....a man kisses a woman oh it wasnt concensual and he gets charged with sexual assault while she laughs knowing its all on him...rubbish"
"what I find more disturbing is that. I think whole problem that guys in the past few centuries have gotten away with little class and being more of a jackass. 

it is not just about porno. it about the attitude of both men and women. women do lust men but without the macho BS and bragging rights, I have no doubt some women do brag about men but more discreetly, less loudly, and more maturely. Guys on the other hand talk about women like a bunch of idiot scoring points or jockying for who can catch a break with hot cheerleader or some shtick. the days of the Porky and the america pie generation has been long gone already. also, their been a generation of males over the past few decades that guys get the stupid notion that they need to loose there virginity on prom night or before graduating high school. that the kind of cycle that needed to be broken unfortunately.

also I do agree the absence of fathers does play a huge role in this issue. Father are the head of the household, the backbone of the family, and head provider. Mothers can't do it all on her own. having both mother and father in the picture brings balance."

佛光山鼓勵性侵害犯罪功成名就
Good.
What she did was wrong and childish. Nobody needed to see this personal texts between two people in a relationship. The texts that showed his side was enlightening on her agenda.
"He only has those boundaries for a romantic relationship, he even states that if she does want to, or needs to, do those things he will support her but they won't be in a romantic relationship. He clearly is ok with her doing those things as long as they're not in a romantic relationship. These aren't precursors to anything as he tells her that she can do those things but they will no longer be in a romantic relationship, obviously not in those words.

He doesn't tell her she cannot have friends, or that she cannot hang out with friends. He doesn't want her around females in unstable relationships which means that she can be around all the females she wants that are in stable relationships.

We should try to understand where Jonah is coming from. We don't fully know all that he's been through. If he's had a problem with drugs or alcohol it stands to reason that he wouldn't want to be in a romantic relationship with someone who wants or needs to do those things, regardless of how they met. That is something I'd assume y'all would support and not say is a precursor to anything. Let's not forget his lived experience, whatever that experience might be!!!!"
"The second message tells me there’s context here that we’re missing. He said he was setting those boundaries based on issues that had come up in their relationship, not that those are his boundaries for every relationship. Yes, it’s not good if a partner separates you from all of your friends, but I think it’s really valid for a partner to say “This particular friend brings out the worst in you/doesn’t treat you well/etc.” Sounds to me like there were people in her life he didn’t think were healthy for her to be around."
Posting personal texts online about controlling (but not illegal or really that horrible) behavior is far more abusive and controlling than the behavior in those texts. It’s unacceptable.
"Also, I totally agree Hannah, putting behavior like this in the bag of ABUSE is only clouding and watering down actual abuse. We have words to describe things for a reason. If things like this keep getting classified as abuse, I feel terrible for actual victims of actual abuse. Honestly, just from the evidence we have of the text, I wouldn’t even call this controlling. She could say he was “too much” or “unreasonable” maybe even “controlling red flags” but people need to be way more selective with their verbiage for the sake of true situations of abuse."
"She seems bitter. I'm soooooo glad I'm gay. Modern women confuse the hell out of me (more now than ever). They'll say they want men to be open and honest and share their feelings etc., but if men do, their words are used against them. He has boudaries. He clearly states what they are and even goes as far as validating her feelings about her choices; i.e.: ""...if these things bring you happiness, I support it and there will be no hard feelings...."" Now, because he has boundaries, he's labelled as controlling, abusive etc. FFS"
They weren't compatible for a long term relationship. They ended it with each other. He went on to meet someone else and have a child. She decided to hold a grudge and be a btch. That's my personal opinion on it.
"I thought your assessment was fair, but I would just push back and say we really don't know what some of her friends are like. They might really be toxic and problematic. It is possible that some of them friends (particularly the male ones) were trying things on her and Jonah noticed it and brought it to her attention. We also don't know of any prior conversation they might have had about this issue. I highly doubt this is the first time he mentioned these to her. He might also just be controlling but we'll never know and I'm not willing to read the texts she's leaked. Either he's been bothering and blackmailing her since the break up (which I highly doubt he's done but I may be wrong) or she's blackmailing him and trying to get money out of him (basically pulling an Amber Heard). In any case, I hope both find true peace within themselves cause vindictiveness will get neither of them anywhere good.

Best of luck to you guys."
Sarah could have conveyed the same message about control and abuse without releasing her exs name or private texts. This wasnt about spreading awareness. This was about her scorching the earth because she found out Jonah got engaged.
"I thought all of Jonah’s boundaries were absolutely reasonable except for the surfing with other men and modeling one. However, maybe what Jonah meant was his boundary is her surfing one on one with another man… I’m not sure if that’s what he meant, but if so, that’s reasonable to me. If you’re in a exclusive relationship I don’t think someone in the relationship should be spending quality time one on one with the opposite sex. If you’re surfing in a group and there’s a man or men in the group I think that’s fine, but it is reasonable to make a boundary that no one on one surfing with a man. Maybe someone wouldn’t like or agree with that boundary but it is at least reasonable. This could be what he meant? 

As far as the modeling one, I have no idea his reasoning for that, especially if her modeling isn’t sexy. 

It’s perfectly fair to be upfront with your personal boundaries to see right away if you’re compatible with the other person. It’s  actually wise to do this before feelings and emotions start to cloud your mind."
"Jonah’s boundaries do line up with a strict moral code which is omnipresent to several Religions.  Just because society has progressed to a point of tolerance for levels of immorality which do not line up with that moral code, does not mean that someone with that code is deficient for upholding the standard.  
Or, maybe he’s irrepressibly self-doubting due to past trauma(s) in a romantic landscape of narcissists and self-destructive egoists"
"A lot of assumptions about Jonah’s thought patterns made by the lady here. I’d also point out that it is somewhat reasonable to expect superficial/vanity aspects as far as social media to tone down a bit once a mutual romantic relationship has been formed.

But to each their own. I don’t care either way, because unless lives are on the line, it’s very rare for me to not recoil in disgust as the release of private conversations.

The price for that in my mind, is a neutralization of the offenses. But I’ll def leave it with the takeaway that this surfer chick is untrustworthy. That’s not a reputation I personally would want to thrust upon myself. Maybe some women will praise her actions here but… In my view, she needs to put her phone away. Maybe Jonah was right, she seems to have an obsession with the internet whereas it is even her solution to personal relationship issues to indeed post it for all to see.

So what was a dead heat has become..

Jonah 10-8 round. And winner."
"I dont know if he was 'isolating"" her.  He just didn't want to be around someone with a dubious or questionable past.  This could be anything.
Imagine shes a recovering drug addict, claims soberity but still hanging out with her addict friends"
"Eh, mixed bag.  Are some of his barriers cringe?  Absolutely.  But everyone acts like having barriers that dictate the type of things you are willing to be around with other people isn't really a barrier.  Heroine addicts can't be friends or spend time with other heroine addicts if they are in recovery.  And he said she can go if those things are that important to her and he won't be mad and he completely understands.  But then to release this 2 years later, clearly aimed to hurt him right after the birth of him and his fiances child, that is malicious.  And while it too is cringe that he ended up asking her to stop things that she was doing before they even met, it's not uncommon for people to change how they present themselves to the world when they are in a relationship vs when they are single."
"Setting a precedent to post private text messages with names is toxic af. If I was a guy I would go no where near her. She waved her red flags. I did like the insight that was discussed from Hannah and Brad but it’s all speculation without full context. Who knows the full story. I’m not a Jonah hill fan but I do feel bad for him, that was violating."
"I don’t know the whole context of their relationship, but most of those things: I thought were reasonable. I think there is a lot of hypocrisy from a lot of younger women now who want all these boundaries for their male partners but when their male partners explain their boundaries it’s all of a sudden “controlling.” Basically, there is this sick mentality of I can do xyz and you can’t. It’s a relationship not a eff buddy or kept man unless that’s what women like her want."
I think her releasing the texts were an attention grab and to hurt his reputation. She's pissed off he's happy. They were seeing a relationship therapist.
"Jonah is the victim. This woman chose to release private year-old text messages just when he has had a child. She is petty and attention-seeking, hoping to start a ""meToo"" avalanche to bury him with other irrelevant women's idiotic accusations about glances, kisses, and sweet nothings.

She knew what she was doing when she consented to a relationship with a man ""below her league."" She wanted the perks of dating someone more relevant and wealthier than her while continuing to fill her emptiness with the hotties she feels worthy of. 

I feel for women who are victims of truly controlling and sadistic men. Which Sarah isn't. 😘

I also feel for men who forget that a whore is a whore. Don't buy into the lies that modern women tell themselves."
"Instead of giving her the option of changing for him, he should have just dumped her."
if i was a celeb man i would not date anyone who wasn’t on my fame level bc the nobodies they hook up with are always batshit crazy
If those were his real boundaries he should have never dated her. That’s the issue for me.
I find it wild she disagreed with his take only to give that same advice just reworded. Not to say anything bad about her it’s just funny
"I really dont see what he did as wrong.
I think the GF was in the wrong on every level"
"If he genuinely gave her the option to walk away how would this wven come close to abuse? If someone has unrealistic boundaries and are upfront about it, they're technically only hurting themselves by making impossible to find a mate. Most of his boundaries werent even that extreme.i wonder if he was willing to adhere to his same rules and possibly even comply with any of her boundaries?"
I dont think the bounties are unreasonable or extreme. They might not be everyone's values but labeling them extreme isn't necessary. She's not a professional surfer.
1:41 he said NOTHING wrong. He told her what he did and didn't want. End of story.
"Knowing that the mother picked them, I think there should be no issue with it. Now I'm saying this as a straight male man. I think the fact that there that emotional to have kid is what any father would feel. I only hope I can show such emotion when one day I have kids."
"Hi. The statistic for domestic abuse seem to actually be more 50/50 in most wider studies, contrary to what Hannah said."
"Ummm...voice notes are worst than text, no?"
Your boundaries are you boundaries there is nothing unreasonable about them you don't like them move on
"I agree with a lot of the points of this conversation, but I do disagree with the word “extreme”. It’s still paints a negative light on someone’s CHOICE and way of living… just because you choose to live a more conservative life, again, not politically conservative, but conservative based on your own values, whether religious-based or not, that’s not extreme. That is personal choice and that is OK. I will say I went into this with a certain way of thinking but I can see how that could lead to an abusive situation if someone is trying to isolate you, but the fact that he just said this is what my boundary is, I still support you, and you can do what you want but maybe we aren’t right for each other, that says volumes about how he was trying to have clear communication with her. I think that she is a clout chaser, maybe he was right that she is an attention seeker because the fact that she would post this years later to make him look bad is disgusting. It’s not a good look, especially for women who do genuinely go through things W
with an abusive partner. She really tried it and I think that she is despicable for it. Maybe speak to your friends about it, but not to the world when it’s so trivial. She is using the stereotypical female fragility and weaponizing her fake tears . At the end of the day I don’t even know what she stands to gain..Social media sympathy? She gets no sympathy from me. It’s not OK to call a man an abuser if he wasn’t."
"Not posing to instagram with bathing suite is extreme??? I think you are very bias since your job is recording yourself to the internet. 

Normal people don’t put their photos online for all to see, bathing suits or not. 

Im none religious, atheist- have nothing to do with any religion and would still not date such a woman who is lacking so much confidence she needs constant validation from the internet. 

Also, you hanged up on one thing he mentioned out of many, it’s clear he gave it a try and it wasn’t one thing that broke him - he also mentioned meeting bad influence friends from the past for more than just coffee. Most people won’t even agree to the coffee part. 

I think he was more than accommodating to her issues"
"Ok so far I don't have any issues with this except the that she say that wemon are more abused in relationships, which is not true. They are more likely to be reported as domestic violence, then men would be more accurate"
"What I thought of the message Jonah wrote, is this can be how introverts think of extroverts. I just looked up Jonah Hills personality type, and most of the google results listed it as INTP . And this woman sounds very extroverted. Introverts need quality deep time together, while extroverts need constant stimulus. And I can see how introverts may come across as controlling to extroverts, while introverts may feel unloved."
Maybe she needs to move on. He has.
Reeks of desperation on her part. Pathetic. Sounds like she was jealous because he moved on and had a baby.  Clearly she is trying to punish him. She could have said that’s not going to work me and moved on. She wasn’t forced to stay. Grow up.
"Is he kinky, i wonder, or is he dead serious"
"He seems like a douche, but that doesn’t make him a villain; just a crappy bf. I’ve had a lot of crappy bfs, but I don’t go around defaming them on social media."
Going out of your way to pursue a model/surfer then telling her she can't model and surf is some weakass energy from him. Don't go after someone who's too much for you then try to cut them down to your size.
This woman screams Amber Heard manipulation. He says these are my boundaries in our relationship because you have done something to break my trust and then they went to therapy for 5 months of their year relationship. He even says he will continue to support her if that’s what she wants to do but just not be in a relationship with her anymore. I’ve been in an abusive relationship before and this is a complete slap in the face to people that actually have PTSD from or have been domestically abused. While yes this could be a red flag or a precursor to an abusive relationship I don’t think that this is where Jonah was going. Now do I agree with him? No. But I’m not the one in a relationship with him. Jonah has also said publicly multiple times that he has mental health issues and body image issues and struggles with those things so maybe that’s where it’s coming from. Still regardless she continued to be in the relationship and continue a 6 month friendship with Jonah until he told her he was in a new relationship and then she completely flipped the script on him. I understand it being hard to leave but after the break up they continue their friendship when she was already “out” and they lived across the country from each other if she really wanted to be out she could have been. I think it’s very manipulative and petty of her to publicly share these text years later when the situation was already over and done. She know what she was doing she wanted to destroy him and give him a bad rep. Especially in todays “woke” and me-too world man are usually guilty until proven guilty automatically people don’t want to research the full story and take a small piece of the evidence or information without context and completely run with it which is what has been done here. She wanted to black list him because she was mad he was with someone else for anyone that bothers to read all the text that were shared it’s clear she’s a jealous ex.
"Jonah hill looks terrible these days. I don’t know if he is still trying to look like Don Johnson from Miami Vice but he needs to just cut it out, stop that non sense lol. Blonde hair does not suit him, long hair slicked back and semi-curly doesn’t suit him and a shirtless azure blue suit DEFINITELY suits no one! Haha.

I really don’t like him as a person he seems like not a good individual. Especially with the people he associates with (maybe he doesn’t anymore but the ones he was known for hanging with). However in this situation I can’t really take the chicks side, nothing I’ve heard about the texts sounds the least bit “abusive” or “controlling”. When you say “maybe we aren’t a good match if you can’t stop these things” is not something that is one of those things would say. If that’s the worst she has, then she sounds the crazy one. It’s very reasonable to not want your GF/wife to take sexualized pictures and share them with the world, and hang out with mostly guys doing whatever they want. It’s this whole “neo-feminist” mindset to think “I should be able to do whatever I want and that includes show off my body with very little clothes and get extra close with guys, potentially hooking up with them. Otherwise I’m being suppressed and being abused by my boyfriend/husband!”"
304😂
"Personal I don’t like Jonah Hill, there is something about him that doesn’t vibe. Don’t get me wrong a few movie of his are good , but he just has a untrustworthy vibe in my opinion.. so I would not be surprised"
"You can't set boundaries once you're already in a relationship not like that that's super controlling how do you not see that look up the word controlling. Now if you set up boundaries like that before you got into relationship okay it's still in psycho and you obviously is really low self-esteem and I doubt many people would get into a relationship with him however it's totally appropriate to set up boundaries before you get into a relationship. So the way he's wrote it too about like I'll be completely happy for you if you don't want to do this shows that he doesn't give a shit about her he'd rather have her do exactly what he wants her to do then not have her at all so why would she want to be with somebody who was just totally okay to let her go. God I'm so glad I'm a lesbian.

Also I'm a guest poster I think that's kind of fucked up and if neither one of them was a celebrity I would say that's way fucked up but the fact is is he has the power he has way more money than her he's famous everybody knows who he is nobody would know her at all if it wasn't for this happening right now if it wasn't for her being Jonah Hill's girlfriend and because I don't follow that shit I had no idea she was before like 2 days ago. So her posting that was a way to take her power back because he manipulated her saying I'll be happy for you That's like a guilt trip thing it's just like it shows that he is a master manipulator you know what I mean The fact that you don't even see the manipulation happening because guys brains don't work like that and that's probably why guys think there's nothing wrong here and girls think there is because to be a master manipulator to where the person doesn't know they're getting manipulated that whole like I'll be happy for you he's like making himself out to be the best guy no matter what she decides but that's just not the case you can't sit there and say I'll be happy for you based on your decisions in the past it's fucking condescending it's patronizing and it's super fucking controlling because you do not try to change people once you're in a relationship. It just goes to show that he didn't put all his cars on the table and got into a relationship and then probably once she was settled maybe she moved in maybe like she got comfortable or whatever and then he makes these rules get the fuck out of here. And I bet the fact that she posted it now if he has a new girlfriend or something like I said he had all the power the money the fame so maybe she was comfortable maybe like she did decide that she wanted to be an individual and not like some missive housewife and decided to you know keep her surfing career or whatever the fuck it is and maybe that's the only way she knows how to make money is like Instagram I have no idea but maybe something happened to where like she's in dead or something maybe like she needs a little bit of fame maybe like fucking he's being an asshole and sending her shitty text that she didn't post You're right we don't have any idea what's going on from both sides but we do have that shit that's printed out there and that shows a Jonah Hill is a master manipulator and probably uses his money in his fame to get women to do any once like I'm thinking like Leonardo DiCaprio wanna be right now.. but Madison manipulator super controlling and if he's like that and more aspects then yeah that's definitely fucking emotional abuse manipulating someone is emotional abuse controlling someone is emotional abuse"

here is a clip from this week's livestream
I wonder how many archived polaroids there are of our favorite celebs ☕️
Let's stop acting as if rich and powerful people don't use celebrity and model agencies  as their own private escort services.
"Some actors are willing to do anything for fame to the casting people, but luckily, Matthew Lawrence saw the light at the end of the tunnel and stood his own ground and refused to do certain things to the director, it’s an example that he had integrity, and stood with his belief and values. Matthew possibly heard and saw some things that goes on behind the scenes in the entertainment industry unfortunately since he was a former child star."
Brian singer was also my first thought. That man is still walking free too just like Kevin spacey
"I totally believe him too, Ti. This is crazy! I’m not surprised by anything anymore."
At this point people need to get comfortable with exposing names. I’m sorry I understand they could lose their career. Have a back up career plan.
I think something happened to Amanda Bynes as well. After working with Dan Schneider from Nickelodeon her mind is completely gone. Her parents have a lot to answer for.
Wow thats sad! I'm proud that he chose to talk about it and I wish him the best in his life!
Damn. I read Martin Lawrence. Let me go get some sleep asap
"The more I hear about Hollywood, the less I want to get involved. Don’t know about you all, but I’ve been less interested into streaming or watching movies/shows because of it."
Interesting because his co star from boy meets world who played Corey is also in that open secret documentary …🤔🤔
LovelyTi connected the dots and pointed out who the director possibly is.🎉
"I read Corey Feldmans book entitled ""Coreography: A Memoir""  It was absolutely harrowing. It's also extremely sad what happened to Corey Haim. Hollywood predators destroyed that poor man's life."
I use to love those brothers. They were suppose to be on the level of BRAD PITT. Very cute white guys...heart throbs. I can see what probably stopped that now
I can see him playing Cyclops.
He’s definitely talking about Bryan Singer 🤷🏾‍♂️💯
Im glad he said something!
I agree with you 💯 and I really commend Matthew for being open and vulnerable to tell his story
Yes that director has many allegations against him. The younger guys that starred in his films had to sleep with him. The xmen male actors should never have slept with the director.
IT tells us all that disrespect remains with all avenues of industry and those who poke fun of others upon the premise of keeping a career speaks volumes upon their character🕛🔄🕛 after all respect is respect
Behind every marval super hero movie there is a super villain behind the scenes like Bryan Singer and James Gun for guardians of the Galaxy and to no surprise the leads are supporting Gun
Joey Lawrence is an 80’s Child Star from the hit show Gimme a Break with Nell Carter

"Ok he sounds like a stand up guy, it will pay off because he stood up..."
Heartbreaking 😢
"Lawrence may be right about Terry Crews being laughed at  but I dont remember any men backing him up. And the one woman who did back Crews, gor screwed by him later."
Wow Matthew Larance went through it. That a shame.
Yet nobody took Corey Feldman seriously when he been saying this sh!t for Years.
"Right on time ti 
Thank you"
When it comes to this conversation I think mehn need to address mehn. Terry had a lot of support from womehn. Womehn went hard in the paint defending Terry. It was a majority of mehn shading Terry. Mehn only want to discuss male S/A as a way to shut down womehn’s stories of S/A. Mehn especially need to show more support in regards to this conversation in their own circles and not just as to gaslight womehn.
Love you Ti!!
Goes alone until all of us is that within the social climate of the exchange it applies to both women and men and it's probably been going on since Hollywood started🕛
Thank you for bringing light to this.
Right on time ❤
Finally!!!!! Something I can watch
"And never forget: Corey Feldman.

Corey appeared on several talk shows (during his book and/or documentary promotion) and spoke about abuse in Hollywood. Not only that, he appeared years earlier on ABC and spoke about “The Casting Couch” and how it applied to children as much as the adults… I’ll never forget that.

And, yet, there was zero outrage or response by anyone in Hellyweird. That speaks volumes. 

It’s a wonder that these victims of abuse and these child actors (Feldman, Aaron Carter, M. Culkin, etc.) always defended MJ. That’s interesting too. Only GOD knows 🤷🏾‍♀️"
yeah that's messed up. in the end it's marvel's loss though. i used to watch matthew in super human samurai syber squad when i was little. i loved that show as a kid. if they put him in marvel as a hero that would have been a nice callback to that and i would watch it for sure. he's a really good actor.
Ready for this tea!
"What I am getting is a lot of the ""men's men"" no pun intended that we love are run through to be where they are."
I wonder if it was Singer. The man behind production of X-men 1 through 3.
Omg Ti u really tapped in wit this damn esp thing bc deadass i was bout to go watch & listen to the ai deep dive again 😂 then u always in my head when u live im typin & u spit out exactly verbatim what im writing 👀... 😂 Luv u sis & cant wait to finally meet u in a few weeks!!❤
It's not Bryan Singer because he didn't win an Oscar award.
"Do remember a couple of years ago when all those explicit photos of those actresses came
out in the cloud? Sometimes I ask myself wear did all those pictures come from? Or better yet who took those pictures?"
"He spoke his truth. If that closes doors, them doors weren’t ones you want to go through. God watches out for us. What we may consider harsh, it may be for our own good. Always tell your truth."
Marc Singer got blackballed since 2019
Y’all pray for Amanda 😢
Watch the documentary ‘an open secret’
I bet you it was the Gambit role.
Doing what's right comes at a cost and Disney Marvel is huge. Both women and men need support on this. There's definitely a double standard.
I helieve him..  ilI was on the a set of a movie and the director hit on me
He was super cute in Mrs. Doubtfire and other movie The Hot Chick. I believe him on his side story.
I was just watching the live lol
I bet it was James Gunn.. he’s had some questionable things said about him
But this stuff has going in the  Hollywood since the beginning
I bet you he was Bryan Singer….
It’s sad how this man has a history of sexual misconduct and he still being paid to make a produce these movies. SMH 🤦🏾 😢
"Hearing about Harvey Weinstein and others use hotels always bothered me. Why conduct business at a place where it’s intimate? In a perfect world, that wouldn’t happen."
❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢
Interesting this video was supressed...😐
"I remember Will Smith saying he went to a party and Quincy Jones put him on the spot to audition for FPOBA right then and there. Will never did say what the audition was. He never said if he had to read over a monologue or script or improv. At least I don’t think he did. 
I wonder what the audition was 🤔"
Hello
🎉
Who showed their junk for their role?
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I’m sorry but I ain’t buying it. Who’s checking for a Lawrence brother?!  They haven’t been a thing since the 90’s. Someone is lying…either him or the director lied & said it was for a Marvel movie
Smh
Tudo o que esse juiz mais queria.

MeToo不分男女！本集節目邀請台灣男性協會理事長陳柏偉，以自身輔導經驗分享男性受害者的困境與難處，另外也邀請老朋友鎖吶，來聊聊美台MeToo有何不同，台灣接下來會走向哪？本集節目將於6/29(四)晚上八點在斐姨所思【阿姨想知道】頻道Youtube、Podcast及Facebook播出。"
建議大家讀讀一個1994出版的書叫Disclosure 作家是鼎鼎大名的Michael Crichton 就是侏羅紀公園的原版小說的作者。故事內容就是男版的metoo. 可惜他的觀念太先進，早了metoo 三十年。大家沒有太注意。
"第一時間要信任受害者的陳述，但也要鼓勵被誣告為加害者的人，不要使用那些迂回的法律手段或非法律手段，應該學習強尼戴普，直接司法進行誣告反擊。
使用迂回的手段，在概念上要不是無知，就是逃避。"
期待這一集
"我覺得依照台灣風格 要停下來可能還要一陣子 
而且說真的如果當下沒留證據 事後要訴諸法律 可能很難吧
只靠敘事 就像之前很熱鬧的師生
到最後老師不也是全身而退
以客觀來說真正成立的證據很少
這波成立的 應該都是當事人主動道歉 而成立的吧
不成功的成功 或許是里程碑的概念"
"現在除了廖峻，剩下的我都不信。
Metoo之所以延燒旺盛，是因人數眾多，大家隱忍太久、太多，常常一個人身上遇到不止一次，受害者們不想再忍讓。
說出來的人超勇敢，他們要面臨許多質疑、謾罵，被認為是小題大作，甚至幫忙說話的，也是曾經受害者，加上其他因素：加害者有錢有勢、有暴力傾向、反社會人格等，都會讓被害者收手，台灣真的不能再這樣爛下去，這些人就該被重判，被下架，除非他們能獲得被害者們原諒。"
這個的完整影片是已經上了還是還沒上片?
"Metoo本意是想讓社會上的權益能夠受到保障，但這種社會運動本身沒有組織運作的情況底下，肯定會發生趁火打劫或惡意去製造對立的問題產生，女性主義本應該是提倡人人實質上的平等，但現在的運動發展至今看到了什麼？不過就是另類沙文主義而已，你不支持我你就是罪人你就是食古不化，why？
台灣真的要去反思台灣就是個國際城市，族群平等，性別平等，階級平等，該怎麼樣去看待跟處理，歧視包含太多面向了，要很謹慎的去思考下一步該怎麼前進才是。"
現在黑人反告大牙，真的是一個讓大家冷靜下來的時間點，當妳講了一些指控，卻又沒有任何證據時，那就要很注意拿捏分寸了，因為妳的武器只有輿論，而反過來對方是可以訴諸法律的
所以梁赫群的本名是陳柏偉嗎？
被小S摸過的男性，也許心有戚戚
小S要是男的不知道要關多久
OMG 用眼睛強姦別人 可以提告嗎？要判刑嗎？ 😂😂😂
"我只希望可以讓男人去找心甘情願的，不要再有其他受侵害的任何形式的人就好。

我相信男人永遠不會真正尊重女性的，只會嘴砲尊重女性的。"
