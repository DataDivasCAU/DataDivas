Pourquoi je soutiens Me Too Stand Up
#MeToo Islam : des lanceurs d’alerte menacés #shorts #mediapart
"Many men are fed up with all the ""rules"" and are simply opting not to talk to women at all."
Men are not “scared” or “intimidated”.   We have observed the minefield and chose a path to avoid it entirely.  We are walking away….
"Ironically, the MeToo movement has become the very harassment that it claims to fight."
"Dont say anything at all, just ignore women, full stop."
"MeToo didn't destroy men.
It woke us up"
"Stop complimenting women, easy."
Every guy I know young or old is absolutely done with women! WAY too much hassle. NOT WORTH IT!!!!!
"Women actually destroyed the workplace the moment they joined it. 

Everything is like walking on eggshells, just waiting for this highly emotional being to find any reason to tick off."
The feminist movement destroyed men long before the Me Too movement came along.
"The same women will make reels and tick tocks asking, 
"" Why don't men approach me in public? "" 
"" Where are all the good men?"" 
"" Why don't men include me in social circles at work?"" 
"" Dating culture is dead in Australia."""
"So called ""strong women"" are threatened by compliments."
The women complaining about men giving compliments are the ones who are jealous because they don’t get any.
Chivalry is dead….you women killed it.
The reason why hr exists is because of women. No hr on the building sites i work on
We’re also sick of being treated as expendable.
"The world is falling apart because men like me just went “alright” and let the women take charge. Are things better? Do you feel safer? Are you happy, now?"
"I avoid all vvomen as much as humanly possible. I'm happy with that, and I am sure they are too. The peace is extraordinary."
"""Me too"" was a wake up call for men."
"Men just switched off, and women are noticing it. Most guys will only go out of their way to interact and help out a small number of women who are related to them. Helping out female strangers? Not worth the risk."
"I refuse to even make eye contact with them on the street at this point. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
"Just like modern feminism. It's not about fundamental rights anymore, but about how much you can get by complaining and playing the victim."
"It’s not the me too movement. It’s that modern women are entitled, have internalized a lot of negative beliefs about men, and don’t feel like they need to offer anything to the relationship. No thanks"
Ignore women… period.
"It's incredibly patronising to be told what you can and can not say as adults and professionals. Treating men like children is commonplace now. Seriously, how did we get here."
"The last time I gave a female co worker a compliment I got called up to HR and they said I apparently made an ""inappropriate remark"". They warned me not to do it again and now I avoid her like the plague. All I said to her was that she looked nice that day because I could tell she put effort into her hair and makeup before work, wasn't even flirting for real as I knew she had a longterm boyfriend.
Never doing that again. Just don't do it fellas."
"Thank you for the compliment. I'm one of the good guys who left the dating scene years ago. When I was still working it got to the point I never talked to women. I went MGTOW to protect myself, my peace and to stay safe."
The same comment from a Chad will elicit a totally different reaction than from an unattractive man----possibly a call to HR.
Construction workers need a massive pay rise. That'd save a lot of men
So MEN's speech is being policed. Shocker.
It hasn't destroyed men. It has shown them who women really are.
I wouldn’t say destroyed- I would say it made us all see the light.
"""Fuckable"" was not on the list though, so maybe they could say it."
"""You're so beautiful"" does come across as cringe, especially in 2025. Gentlemen, don't do it. Treat them like men."
"if i spent that much money on a ticket just to be told my speech is to be policed, i'd demand a refund of 200% for every man there, and then have us all leave."
"The biggest problem is that the men who actually have good intentions and respect women listened and did what they said, they stopped approaching or even talking to you at all. The creeps who want to take advantage of women already didn't care if what they were doing was wrong, and so they continued on as usual. So all you achieved was removing any good men from the equation. Funny how the bullies never had trouble getting dates, the abusers, the criminals, never known any of them to struggle with women. Good men who respect and care about women? They mostly die alone after a life of being invisible. Why are we shocked when the younger generations are following Tate etc when all they ever see are good men suffering and bad men winning?"
It destroyed relationship dynamics and also promoted false victims meanwhile the actual victims are drowned out.  Men adapted as we always do.
"It didn’t destroy men. It just changed them to consider life without women, and for the most part it’s a positive experience."
Men are fed up with the overreach and the planned destruction of men by the people behind this movement.
I'd ask for a refund right there. Give me my $500 dollars back and I'll spend my time doing something else.
"I have not complimented a woman in years. Frankly, I don't care anymore."
I just married a woman from a non Western culture. I don't need to ask her what she brings to the table. I don't need to ask what I get back for all the energy I put in. It's obvious.
I live by one rule. Never compliment a woman ever!
Don't blame metoo. Blame the women who joined it or promoted it AND the women who were sucked into believing it.
HR isn’t a necessary part of a company
"One of the reasons I gave up romance and I know I am not the only one to do so. Women want to be left alone, they got their wish."
It has freed a lot of men from devorce rape and false allegations ❤
Gender policing is descrimination. Do not participate in such misandry.
Enjoy your career in 'cybersecurity.' The jeets will have your jobs in short order.
"🤷‍♂️ Gentlemen, simply walk away. I can assure you, your silence will be greater than any “offensive compliment” a woman has ever received."
"""destroyed"" = set them free 😂😂😂😂"
"The ""metoo"" movement hasn't made any impression on me, I can assure you Danica😂😂😂😂"
"Anything bad that has happened to women at miscellaneous moments in history will pale in comparison to the catastrophic mistake of MeToo.

Women didn’t just screw men over during that movement, women screwed themselves, each other, their daughters, younger sisters; anyone that now has to navigate the world today post MeToo. 

Most men and women are alone now because for men, it’s not worth risking their lives and reputations on speaking to, approaching or associating with the wrong woman.

It’s over and there no going back now."
"$500 per ticket - nice.
Women need their own award ceremony - great.
Being told how to speak - fabulous."
"In a work environment, always compliment with ""You look almost competent"" instead of ""You look sexy."""
"The ""MeToo"" movement has left women single for life.
Men are not destroyed, they are doing their own thing without women.
Bye, bye ladies."
"They basicly ban the legit compliments ...
Did they hand notes to women ?

God, lately I do regret being part of this mankind ..."
Men are having the last laugh as they walk away and give feminists what they want at first and later regret.
Can you imagine if you reversed the genders and a man handing out a pamphlet to all the women explaining how to be appropriate.
"Most women think this is fixable,
They are wrong, 
They are starting to see that men are not scared,
WE ARE DONE, 
AND DONE MEANS PERMANENTLY DONE."
"There’s an old saying: least said, soonest mended.  When in doubt, hold your tongue.  Silence may be misunderstood, but it can never be misquoted."
"Women only want compliments from Chads.  Every other man need not offer their compliments, thank you very much."
And women wonder why men stopped even approaching them at all.
"""MeToo"" didn't destroy men at all.  To most men it restored (or should have restored) knowledge they should have known from childhood regarding the realities of women's nature and behavior.  It demonstrated very loudly what women naturally are.  It reminded us of what societies throughout human history inherently knew but our society somehow forgot.   If anything, ""MeToo"" returned men's regard of women back in line with nature and objective reality.  Men's behavior toward women now is the natural response to these women's natural behaviors.  This is why societies worldwide throughout history managed women they way they did.  If they didn't, this happened and the society collapsed.   Organize your regard for women and your behavior with women by what women naturally do and how they regard you and treat you when free to do so, observe what is happening now -- let that be your teacher and guide.  This is what women really are.  Plan and respond accordingly."
"No, no, it set men free, best thing that ever happened"
The women insecurity award. That would be a tough battle.
I like how they only handed these to men. As if women can't possibly be creepy and innapropriate at a workplace.
"The women's movement won the battle, but lost the war."
"2017 August lost job because a female and outsourced workers claimed I exposed myself, multiple cameras displayed the true testament, yet I was the one in the wrong...""me too"" can lay in the bed it's created, made an indefinite enemy."
Actually the metoo movement destroyed women. Men walked away and women lost their minds
"Giving power to those who have no loyalty, wisdom, conscience, or morals invites chaos. 

These women will be in a bad mood and will destroy a man based on accusation alone. 

And look at the results- more enmity."
"I no longer mentor women. They don’t need help. The men need help in the workplace, most of the women are DEI hires"
"As a man cruising into middle age i have mates who are single / divorced. They now refuse to date because its too dangerous. They live in fear of slander and false accusation. One has admitted to me he plans to be celibate and die alone, numerous dates with all kinds of women they no longer ask about work, taste in music etc but from 1st minute of sitting down cross examine him on polical views. He told me when he realised he was trying to get a table with plenty of cctv on him he just went stuff it, ill stay hm."
"If it flies, floats or phucks, it's cheaper to rent."
I worked in and office and women would ask me from time to time what I thought of their outfits. I refused to answer.
"You can just take out the space between ‘In’ and ‘Security’, and it works perfectly."
Glad I’m old and not having to date. If I were a young man and woman approached me at the bar I would immediately think I was being set up.
The juice is no longer worth the squeeze.
"""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"". Clip from old move, still relevant to-day!"
"Glad that
1) I wouldn't go to an event like this
2) I never compliment women I don't know"
And very soon technology will destroy and replace women
It used to be comical that people would have such audacity to be policing others in such a childish way. It really is just an embarrassing grab for authority in position when there really is nothing to be had
"I for one, am not ""destroyed"". My single male friends rejoice at being woman free.🇦🇺"
"No no no.
Its destroyed women and freed men"
"Just say they look dreadful, and if they had a issue, tell them they did not want us to say nice things, so we went just as negative as they are"
Do not bother with them full stop
"If it were my list, I’d have Nothing on it because Modern women deserve Nothing. 👎"
"I read through a couple of hundred comments here, not a single one from a woman. That's very telling."
"LOL. I don't feel ""absolutely destroyed"". Drink some whiskey. Get over it. Remember, gentlemen: You are always fertile. The biological clock is her responsibility. Choose wisely."
"Just sue in court the woman who did this note only to m'en fir discrimination and sexisme, lol !"
I don’t even call it the me too movement because I call it the lie too movement because most cases around the world have been proven to be lies.
Him downplaying it doesn't really help to raise awareness
Removing compliments in this situation actually hurts females more than men.
"I can see how this will end up.  Men will only be able to say ""Hello Cynthia, you look okay tonight."""
"ignore women, do not grant them any space whatsoever"
"I just don't speak to them at all anymore.  Only if necessary, and very brief about it.  They bring nothing but trouble and drama."
"The problem in not that women get an unwelcomed compliment, it's the fact that women who expect that compliment do not recieve it."
Were was the note to the women why are they able to say you look handsome
"3:22 She claims that most people know intuitively what is appropriate and what isn’t.

The problem isn’t “most people” it’s the fringe, radical outliers that use the system to batter men. These crazies use law as a weapon to “smash the patriarchy” or “score points for the Sisterhood” … at the expense of reasonable men."
Bypass the self crippling deal of modern marriage and just adopt if you want to start a family.
"Toxic feminism has destroyed the appeal of women, and the result is collapsing birth rates, and about to collapse welfare states and pensions."
The best move started from Kerala ! We need such report in all industry 🎉
"Kerala is the first to appoint a committee to learn about the industry problem..
Other industries also should have this type of courage"
Mollywood does create impactful cinema and is the first in the film industry to establish a committee to ensure safety and equality for women. Kudos to Mollywood for spearheading this important reform.
Kudos to the actresses of Malayalam film industry for stepping up and fighting courageously while other industries use women for pleasure and benefits....🎉
He should resign . But enquiry must be conducted and if  any action against law must be proceeded with.
"I am a man and I find it despicable that a woman, or anyone, should be forced to respect anyone against their free will."
"I am happy this has started atleast with Malayalam cinemas, Respect to those who came forward and acknowledged this.Now it's time for others too, I am sure this happens in bollywood and others too. It's high time now for everyone to stand up and speak. Let more of Hema committee be formed. Let this be a lesson for other too."
Malayalam film industry is totally cleaning all the mess and its for good future.. but other industries face the same but no one is taking initiative for this cleansing process! Everyone should stand up for this 👍
"You lost your case when you said Today Super star .. He is an actor.. How come any actors become super stars wen they are ready to entertain, dance, drama for 3 hours for 100 rupees ? Society is screwing them.. They are actors, period.. Superstars are our parents who work day and night for us, our teachers , our friends who help us etc.."
Women are so badly treated.😢😢😢 Shameful.😢😢😢
Same or worst exist in Bollywood.... Why only talk about mollywood
"Now set up a committee to investigate Media, Politics, Police etc.. Lets hema committee be the first step towards this..."
"The important thing to notice is that the movies that arebreaking
Barriers anyways have not included this powerful nexus of actors... They always have been incapable of any progress"
"Salute to you all for exposing the corruption and exploitation. From pakistan. You all are on the right path. 
Nothing would have happened if this was pakistan ."
"Why did he resign now. FEAR of being prosecuted or defamed ??? How convenient. He must have know all the happenings including the kidnapping & rape & torture of the actress, for SURE. But remained silent so his and his sons career is not affected. There is no way he did not know. Now he wants to play god. Super 👍🏼"
What about media industry?
Good job... these pervert film production related criminals should be ashamed.
Its the same or worst in other film imdustries of south ..they dont come out
I had huge respect for Mohanlal before seeing this video
Do u understand this is the first time an industry going forward and correcting .
"🙊 This is the kind of society we live in, which govt, what law, what police, what feminism?!!!! Women are unsafe."
They're right to be punished.
I ❤ Palki Sharma#she' s an honest journalist and says everything clear and cut throat! Keep rocking 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Hypocrisy at its peak. 😊
Exactly… but it's not only in the Malayalam industry but I feel it's in Bollywood too. And they don't even know that they are abusing the weakest. And they are proud of doing it.
Mohanlal seems to successfully accomplished 1000 women in toto😢
Should just be a precedent to many others that must be investigated throughout India.. toughest punishment should be handed over to such power group operators.
When will India start treating women with respect
Their State & National awards should be withdrawn if proved guilty !!
"This issue is true in every other filim industry here in India (or world)
I hope we get them to also get a expose of them ..."
"There is something which nobody noticed, there is hidden lobby against leadership of AMMA , they Jailed Dileep for crime done by Pulser Suni, 
Director Kamal (original name is Kamaal ) and director Renjith did the same crime but only Renjith had to resign from same post, 
There is a Jihadi & Missionaries lobby behind this drama, no Muslim actor name is coming out except Siddique who was supporting Dileep,"
Kerala always leading cultural revolutions.. disrupting systems.. proud of you Girls and Boys ❤
HIGHEST LITERACY RATE FOR CRIMINOLOGY.
I am suprsed  to come to know the happening in the kerala film industries
Imagine a committe investigate about bollywood 😂
"Real face of Kerala. No jobs there people prefer to go outside of Kerala to work. No industries because of bad policies of Communist govt ruling the state. Achievements of Kerala people highest number of people recruited in ISIS, Malayalam Cinema scandal women are not safe in Kerala."
"Respect to mohanlal!! Nowaday  position holding people don't even resign even after such cases and reports.... 
Direct example... Brij bushan singh!!!!!"
Keep pushing for equality for women in 2024.
"Well said, reel and real life are two very different things! 👍🏾✌🏾"
"This is what kerala has been from the past.
Exploiting the powerless until a days everything is exposed.
It's shameful."
I love the newscaster ❤ very powerful.in that case.....well done 👍
He should be investigated and prosecuted if evidence exists against him. The crimes occurred under his leadership.
Why isn't the perspective not diplomatic and holistic. Mollywood speak up against violence and hold them accountable. Has even Hollywood done this?
Movie and reality is always different. What u see is what is not
A reel life hero but A real-life villain 😢
🎉🎉❤☔☔☔☔☔☔ Mam pal🎉☕ .. 🌄
"Mam, Entire flim industry in India works in same fashion among them one state alone got exposed !!!. Hope its one among the known secret's in india..."
Glad things are changing!
This is there in every place.There are such groups everywhere. There are such people in every industry. Like Tovino said let it be remembered that the change started with Malayalam cinema(as always).
It was high time Malayalam industry needed this clean up!
"Every where this type of thing's happen, In  it is very less compare to other other flim industries in India. Mean while what about media industries...??"
Well done Kerala.
What about Honey Rose?
"Shame on the  mallus  who are very  proud  of their  superstar mohanalal, this is what  expected  from a literate  state  .. wow"
"Universal all 'woods' globally practice. Somebody exits, someone else fills in. Next? ... if ok to entertain, enter into entertainment. Show must go on.
Love from India 🔱💯💖"
This is why a particular community has progressed in Kerala and other honest citizens were left out. Everywhere we go we see the result of such dirty deeds being done
Yet they are the ones breaking the ice ❄
"One thing I didn't understand what is the role of president of India, n our hounable p m should take action in this matter,"
I am speechless.
Tip of icedurg
Same is in Bollywood They block outsider as  far  as possible . U meet Sushant like fate if are ambitious
But the biggest issue is where is the actual proof. How is this any different from the Zomato case?
Do u think Mohanlal was not aware...??? Not possible
"Conduct such a committee enquiry in bollywood too. Kerala initiated this, the other states shall follow this way"
Woman rights and freedom of choice and speech.  The laws must be inforce now against corruption practices and exploitation.
Finally truth is taking over
"Irony :most literate state is reeling under casting couches (favours by men for work opportunities for women ) 
This is evident not only education is important,.
QUALITY EDUCATION IS NEED OF HOUR(SDG 4)"
"The HEMA committee you mentioned has nothing concrete other than a power group. 
A power group is the whole point of having a committee in the first place. Whether the committee is behaving decocratically or autocratically is the only question. 

If you don't have facts, don't compensate it with activism 😂😂😂"
Gods own country realities 👀🤷🏽‍♂️🙏🏽
"The matter shouldn't end there, resigning doesn't yield the desired results. The responsible culprits  should be arrested and prosecuted and finally be banned from the industry.  We can see, as in other cases,  the probe and the investigations, be it by anyone else, take their own time thus delay the justice  to the victims."
Good job Mohanlal.
"Where I come from, men stand when a woman walks in or is about to sit at a table 😂"
"This exists in every industry , just that people are shit scared to talk"
"BTW, the people who are under the scanner are not the new filmmakersthey are from 80s ..."
God's OWN COUNTRY 😂😂😂 100% literacy 👍👍👍
Never Ending Story....🤔
Beautiful palki with beautiful earrings ❤
"This news is misleading. He is not involved in any of the accusations. He resigned because many other actors were accused, and as the president of the association, he chose to step down"
Now mohanlal  must reveal the villains
"Malayalam industry is progressive to have an hema commission, why don't other industries do the same."
🙌🏻
"Madam palki I had deep respect for you, these ladies who are protesting are they innocent, all of a sudden they realized they were sexually assaulted 
 Today's generation are ready to do anything to get inside cinema. Then where is this humma commission 😊 never stoop low to report such crap"
AND AT THE CENTRE THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE BRIJBHOOSHANS RULE THE SPORTS FIELD. 😢😢
It's Happening all the indian film industries...May be International...
Well i regret resignation was late. Need investigation and Well done HEMA committee report. But nothing to do with women alone to stand. EVERYONE DOES
Dare any other government for such a report on their filim industry 😅
He also cheated an Tamil actress and she died few decades back
Good! Book the rest accused. We don't need them.

Why did you leave wion palki? Was that a mollywood power group initiation
Manipur CM should have resigned too but yet he is there . Not supporting anyone but why he has not resigned?
This happens in all film industry 😮 sad reality
How come Mammotty is not in news at all
Should be punished....
Firstpost has some new thing in hand now to talk about for a few weeks until they get something else😅
It's Kerala not India sarrrrr😂😂😂😂😂
"Exploitation is everywhere. It's in cinema industry, in media industry, in textile industry, in construction industry everywhere. I worked for a construction company in Adoor (Kerala) called Builtech Builders and I didnt get any salary and then I resigned.  There are a lot of people, men and women who left this company similar way. They would conduct interviews once in every 3-5 months offering big salaries and absorb people and then after 2-3 months these people would be laid off and they would get no salary or a meagre amount. During their tenure there these people would be mentally  tortured and would be rendered as good for nothing fellows. And you won't dare to complain as you would be intimidated by the photos that are being posted in the various company whatsapp groups by the MD showing himself standing with many top politicians and ministers of Kerala State. So exploitation is everywhere."
100 true
"Movie industry of india , they show it in their own movies like fashion , real life story of silk smitha the dirty picture , real life stories of women who gets into a toxic work culture... 
Make few women senior artist as head of the film department, this will solve the toxic work culture."
Will there be a committee for bollywood?
This is why women dont come forward. These girls risked everything to tell their most embarassing stories. And this guy is walking free... i hope they are protected
"I saw a video of him lifting Cassie and slamming her, it broke my heart. This monster should be rotting in prison 💔"
Actually the real reason he isn’t being charged with the serious offences is because it happened in America. You guys elected trump again and he broke the law how many times? Celebrities and rich people are not treated like we are treated in the USA
He’s rich.
He’s rich and has people willing to do anything he asks.
As a survivor who was failed by the justice system this is so heartbreaking and devastating… I really thought it would be different this time but I’m not surprised. Heart just aches for the victims
We need more Mario's brother
"No, he walked because too many rich and famous people were involved ."
We live in a victim blaming society.
"Honestly, I’m not surprised that Diddy got away with a slap on the wrist"
The real reason he wasn't found guilty is because there was no proof. End of story
"Sadly, this isn't surprising"
If the stories are true he's committed much more heinous crimes then that he's being charged on. Just that his victims are too ashamed or afraid to come forward.
The fact that people are complaining the procescution didn't cater to the jury is disgusting. We truly are a country where facts don't seem to matter anymore. It could happen right in front of their face and they would need to be convinced it happened.
"Yeah honestly. The rule of law does not protect the innocent. Its main priority, especially in america, seems to be ensuring criminals are not convicted of too many crimes. Cause the prosecution was the government so they have access to as much evidence as they can sanction. All the defence has to do is figure out a way to weasel out of it. I think criminal lawyers get the easy ride too. They earn more and often use the tactic of badgering already vulnerable witnesses to weaken their testimony or relying on jury members being held in contempt. Just my perspective but i have VERY LITTLE faith in the rule of law as a woman. 
I see it fail us all the time, especially in SA cases, which is why we often refuse to report or press charges. Why bother when the odds are stacked against you even more"
Its not because he’s rich it’s because the thing jurors needed to believe was women in low standing and they would rather believe the man they’ve seen physical beat and abuse these people than the actual victims.
He is a waste of space and had a seriously gullible jury!🙄
"Disappointing, but not surprising."
Follow the money of the jury it will tell it all
"It wasnt the justice system that failed, it was the jury lol"
He 100% is going to be part of DT's administration
"Money talks, 💩💩 walks"
It was misogyny. They simply didn’t believe the women.
Of COURSE Trump would pardon him! Women have to unite NOW!!!
"The justice system worked as intended. To protect the interests and the persons with power. It is not, and never has been, about righteousness."
"Please let this dude rot in prison, he's been doing messed up stuff since the 90s."
"This is my third attempt to leave a comment on your video, but YouTube keeps deleting it.  The first comment was an intelligent response.  The second comment was me complaining about YT purposely deleting anti-Diddy comments and they even deleted that out!!!!  Let’s see if this third comment sticks.  Oh yeah!  There’s no intelligent comment in this third posting and the anti-Diddy stuff so yeah it’ll stick."
"Honestly, this verdict made me so upset and so disgusted at the geriatric jury! Stop having people from 1960. Make decisions for women in 2025. It’s absolutely disgusting. Sean is a human trafficking predator who beat and tortured women abused his employees literally committed Rico like activity and walked away because he’s famous tired. I hope the judge gives him the maximum I don’t care. I am furious with this."
"Weistein, Cosby and now Diddy.  Its absolutely disgusting how rich men just get a slap on the wrist"
Witness testimony is the worst form of evidence allowed in the legal system. It sounds like that's why he was not found guilty on those counts. You need something more solid than just a bunch of accusations to convict someone of a crime.
Trump wanted a taste of Diddy party
Rich and depraved are always protected
My point stands that Trump only ever pardons the worst people on Earth.
This whole thing is like a Boondocks episode
Victim blaming.NOT COOL!
And they'll tell women not to use the second amendment
Nope. The witnesses painted themselves as willing participants in the freak offs. Ruined the entire case the more they spoke. He will still do 5-10.
Because they were seeking life. I'm an up-to-20-year-total qualified juror.
Start dishing our your own justice ladies. Just know how to do it
outrageous.  They disregarded the victims.  Anyone found the children yet?  Disgusting!!!
Tell me something new 😢
The fact they keep saying he is going home with a possible 20 yrs sentence . Sounds like simething is shady. Make it make sense
"There was no evidence, I don't know why he even went to jail. I'm not saying he's not a bad person but the evidence wasn't there. I'm done with this channel this lady is too extreme"
"Close enough, welcome back R-Kelly trial"
"Alternatively, we dont know the whole story as we weren't presented any of the evidence nor did we hear any rebuttals against that evidence, all we knew were the charges. Reminder a prosecutor doesn't need beyond a reasonable doubt evidence to CHARGE someone with a crime, they only need Probable Cause"
"You push things too far in one direction, and the pendulum will swing back."
Such bull$hit
Why anyone has faith in The justice system is beyond me
Money
"Nope, all wrong. You have no idea of what's really going on here. I promise it has nothing to do with the metoo movement. This is WAY more complex than anything like that."
Those jurors should be ashamed.
"Lawyers are very skilled at discrediting women, they have methods to paint them as liars and twist their words into seeming like something it’s not. This is why women seldom speak up."
Yasssss. What about those kids and looking into child Protective Services. Where are these kids  coming from.
"All that baby oil was actually just to make sure no one could make the charges stick, apparently"
Free Luigi
20 years in means he’s gonna die 💀 in prison.
Oh well. Seems to me when someone is put in prison we say the system finally worked and when someone is found not guilty we say the system is broken.
"I didn't follow, but I've seen people saying he didn't even have a defense, no witnesses, nothing..."
Trump only pardoned him because he wants an invite to the next party.
Because he has too much money and has too much dirt on other wealthy people. That’s why!
"He’s being not guilty has nothing to do with being black! It’s because of being evil! Christ honors women and demonstrates it by choosing a woman for the 2 most honored responsibilities ever given: birth of Christ; and proclaiming, “He is Risen!” She became the first Evangelist!"
Stay inside
I'm not surprised
I have a friend who is angry about the Diddy verdict but is a full on Trump loving cultist. How do women like her not realize that all of this is tied together?
They didn't have more women on the jury because they couldn't find that many that couldn't say they havent been sexually assualted
Lame take
What about the jailhouse phone call Diddy made telling his sons to destroy the evidence in his house before the cops find it
A rico charge is for an organization not 1 person! That was stupid from the beginning.
Now he coming for the victims.
Amber Heard destroyed the MeToo movement
BTW Lil Tay Just Started Her OF
8 men and 4 women.... Wow. Okay. Probably could have gone with an equal amount of men and women.... That's why they didn't find him guilty.
"#1 is he is rich. #2 idk her name, but the one lady stayed with or came back to him after being raped and abused."
"""witch hunt"" 😂 this country sucks."
I'm sorry but women have a looong way to go to as far as same sentence for same crime n don't get me started on divorce and custody
Trump got him off
Classic. Smh 😪
💙🤮💙🤮💙🤮💙
😂😂😂 wtf is wrong with all. The counts were unanimous so what about the 4 women on the jury? Yup its all men's fault 😂😂
"It's violates human rights to want anyone ever to be convictable of anything, ever, only on believing a victim's word. Word against word is never ever evidence, hence never ever due process."
Also because money
Oof.
🤬
🫴⚖️
I have mixed feelings on the metoo movement especially in regards to the johnny depp and amber heard trial
Why doesnt nowthis post anything about israel?
"I know no details of this case, but it sure sounds like a good place to end jury trials.
Where I come from, we just don’t have them. We may need more judges, but it feels more suitable when times are changing but some people don’t want to go along with it."
That's a stretch to see that the democrat led search is motivated by metoo
You don’t get to have your cake and eat it too. Judy found they were willing participants so yea.
Lol shut up he rapped men to what are you talking about? Stop blaming men
Its all men.
"If that was on the drawer as a woman, I would’ve found him not guilty of every single charge"
Will trump pardon diddy?
"This is the thing with current dems. Most men who vote don't care about this. Woman are vindictive. The voting age men dont like the lgbthdtv movement, or the me too movement. This loses you supporters. i hate current republicans but i dont like the current dems. Most men have to chose the lesser of two bad choices. Shame on you guys forcing your opinions on the whole of dems."
Haha
It’s because the jurors voted not guilty on the serious charges.  A fair jury was chosen.  Maybe the government didn’t prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
For the people who don’t know when diddy was found guilty of “the transportation to engage” he was going to the house of women who worked at nowthis news cause that’s what they are
"Oohhh ummm the sentencing guidline is actually 27 months max. 
Which is why they prosecutors asked for 56 months not that 20 year bs yall heard and that 56 is stacking the charge which the guidlines dont call for so 27 months is the max. He won't get more like 18 to 20 months so diddy will be home by valentines day max 🤷🏾‍♂️ sorry that doesnt make you happy"
"There's more to it than not believing women. This limited scope will lead to villainizing jurors. There are elements of a crime that have to be met, beyond a reasonable doubt, to find someone guilty. Unless you're in the room or hearing jurors victim blaming, this hot take is irresponsible"
He’s not guilty
double the sentence of false accusers
"Absolutely agree with him.
If a woman makes false accusations, She should immediately be sentenced the same amount of jail time the man would get if convicted"
Took him years and tens of millions.
And thats the real problem. The fact that women rarely(if ever) are punished for false accusations against a man.
It's funny how heard claim Johnny beat her but the next day there was no bruising or swelling. Other ladies that were beat up had body and face swelling and bruises everywhere. No makeup can really cover it up. Heard had flawless makeup
"My husband went through this. Unfortunately, we don't have Johnny Depp money, so he had to take a deal rather than get the not guilty verdict"
Living with someone who poops in your bed is demonic. 😂
"*when SHE is cryin, SHE is lyin!*"
It's sickening to accuse someone of rape and abuse
I 100% agree with myron here protect your seed yall avoid this as much as possible its not worth it the risks outways the benefits it happened to 2pac as well
“ Shitting on beds and stuff “ 😂😂😂
That's true . Tha happened too to such a celebrity. Just imagine regular men.
"Sadly due to corrupted women abusing their privileges.  A lot of innocent men are in jail. Even if they prove their innocence, their lives are still forever destroyed."
I have a rule.  If a woman accuses a man of something i listen but don't believe.  If the guy is rich or dated the girl and moved on I immediately side with the guy.
"She's evil, not crazy."
Shitting on beds and stuff 😂
Shit the bed and tried to blame it on the dog
She should’ve been in prison for life
"This dude is 100% right I absolutely agree with him women that do this type of shit they need to be held accountable and I’m a woman saying that, so what does it say about me?"
Shout to all my exes for never shitting on my bed🤙
Don't forget this also had butterfly effects. Completely destroyed the Fantadtic Beast franchise.
Mandatory DNA test for every birth in the US
If it can be proved in the same court that the accuser lied they should get similar punishment that the original defendant would have been facing
I agree 1000%!  Yes protect women if there found guilty. But if caught lying or slandering? Whatever time that man would have got. The false accuser should do.
"I think you’re all being too harsh on her, don’t forget her dog stepped on a bee! 😂"
Jail all false accusers.
He brought up the herd turd right out the gate😂😂😂
"I got accused of grape with a girl I didn’t even get to 2nd base with, some of my friends believe her, lost them, I live in a semi small town so my name was hurt too. The girl lied, nothing came of it cause the grape kit safe me but my name was never cleared. Now I don’t trust. I was this close to going to prison. 💔"
Never fails women's like always...smh just too proof he was guilty smh
"Take note men. Record EVERYTHING. You never know when you will have to use it in the court of law. Every time you feel ""Man, that's not right."" Record it. And don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. These women out here don't care about you bro. And they will destroy you financially out of spite and then rinse and repeat with the next guy."
"Next time you watch pirates of the Caribbean, remember the entire series was ended by one dump"
"Yeah I’m a victim of false accusations it’s sickening, what that woman put me and the rest of my family through"
"In the middle of actively trying to destroy Johnny Depp's life because she is petty, Amber Heard got a modeling contract."
"I thought he recorded in his own home? 
Not illegal"
I watched the entire trial (or at least part of it that was allowed on camera) that crap was crazy
"A woman can write your name on a birth certificate and in most states, even if the baby is not yours, you have to pay or they will go to jail."
I thought falsified police report was a crime in of itself!
But the feminists won’t talk about it🤦🏿‍♂️
"Yes indeed, glad someone has spoken on this. Why is it that the person that cries wolf doesn't get in trouble when they lie. I had the same thing happen after it was investigated they found out she was lying and nothing was done after. I didn't go through the same thing with court and everything but I had to speak to the detectives a few times and then come in a third time to get the information about what happened."
Its not illegal to record conversations as long as one party knows.
"We really need to penalize
Women who are physical emotional verbal mental 
Abusers for not only
Monetary benefit or gain but for everything else that they're abusive for & wanting
To Control & they Lie!!

"I agree, we need to punish those who get proven to have lied about their accusations. Not a matter of “believe all women”, it’s a matter of ensure no lying."
false accusation should hold the same charge as the accusation
"At the very least, a false accuser should receive the same sentence the accused would have gotten."
"She was penalized, she lost the court and was ordered to pay $15 Mil"
"Yall see the video of amber on the stand railing a line of blow? 🤣 it’s apparent she lied about everything, ended up needing the grace of the Yayo just to last"
He ain't lying there
"I am a woman, I was graped when I was 12 and for me it is abhorrent to cry wolf about something so serious... real victims or survivors are often not beleived because of theese dispicable frauds 😮😮😮"
Don't forget he already got found guilty and one court of Law and had to go through the whole thing again
Bro looks stressed out. The life he lives has caught up to him. Was it worth it? Nothing he did changed anything. 304s are 304s and simps are simps.
She should be in jail
He didn't lose the purses of the  carribean he turned the role
Most of us don’t have the money or resources to prove our innocence
🦆 the british courts that sentenced him guilty
"I have audio of a woman literally hurting me, three days after 4 level neck fusion. Laid up in a bed... couldn't even go downstairs. Police arrested me, saying, I instigated it by, and I quote... ""Not doing as she asked and going to wash the car."" Literally, three days after being released from 4 level, neck fusion with cadaver bone.

State of Idaho. CDA. Judge Peterson. Convicted me, I spent my 30 days after fusion, in a cell. Neck fusion. Needed help to even wash my body, wasn't able to shower for a month. Didn't get to see my real doctor's. KMC medical center even said I didnt have surgery... the fired the doctor who did the surgery, she now works in WA state."
So Johnny Depp is the Spokesperson for what Black men have gone through for decades.
The process is the punishment
I just got done with a 3 year battle because of that.
Send these woman who make false accusations to El Salvador for the rest of their life.
"100. She needed punished. She perpetuated evil.
😢
She went free"
This is why I don’t want to be in a relationship
This is so important!
That was crazy work.... shout out to Johnny d
And she never lost her role in Aquaman 2
Johnny deep was definitely innocent smh
100% true. Men need legal protective n from women's false accusations.
"Yup.  Some. People just want money

We've created a monster
"even teenage girls (rarely, i admit) do this too. can't remember the details, but there was this young black man who got his future and scholarships taken from him because she falsely accused him... and she didn't even feel bad about it."
That last part needs to be true
You can use most divorce and custody cases to prove your point.
"False accusations can destroy marriages, careers and lives. Not only that but also i believe it's very disrespectful towards real victims who previously or currently have to deal with real domestic abuse. It diminish the struggle."
Any average normal regular guy who went through with Johnny Depp went through with Amber Heard would have had their life destroyed because they don't have his resources.
"My baby Mama was abusive both verbally and emotionally to me to the point where I had to leave her and then after I left her went to the courts and claimed all this stuff like im stalking and drugging and drinking and  when I haven't even seen her or my kids in  over a year... So I take her to court and the judge just eats up everything she says Without even checking anything like taking a second to like Ask me Anything she just sentenced me to having to do a bunch of hoops to jump through and gave her the  temp restraining order she was asking for when there was no contact at all just to keep me from my kids to punish meverbally and emotionally to me to the point where I had to leave her and then after I left her went to the courts and claimed all this stuff like im stalking and drugging and drinking and  when I haven't even seen her or my kids in  over a year... So I take her to court and the judge just eats up everything she says Without even checking anything like taking a second to like Ask me Anything she just sentenced me to having to do a bunch of hoops to jump through and gave her the  temp restraining order she was asking for when there was no contact at all just to keep me from my kids to ""punish"" me."
"To add on, the public, even the women, believed Depp because he's a movie star. If it's another average guy, none of those broads will care, and will still think he's the abuser. Women decides if you're right or wrong based on things like your money, status and how they FEEL about you. They don't ever make rational decisions"
When men finally wake up and realize that woman are mo longer these innocent frebble soft humsns.  The world will be better off
We went from not listening to women....to believing everything...human nature over compensaing
we can't punish people for falsely accusing women of being witches cause then they won't come forward for the real witches
"I genuinely believe that if a woman lies about sa and its proven that she lied, she should serve the time the guy would've served if he was proven guilty.. anything beneath that punishment is insane."
Key correcton... the recordings were not illegal... they were prescribed by their couples therapist as part of their counseling.
And there are still females who believe Johnny is guilty of Amber's  allegations.
"Thanks ladies, you told men to not ever believe you or take any of you serious. Us men risk jail for even taking any of you seriously. And i never heard of one woman that ever called this out. To this day. Hence why ill never never trust women. Thanks ladies, you ruined it for the the rest of them. Ladies, start at calling the rest of them out and denouncing them atleast"
Don’t know any women to be raped but I know multiple guys who were falsely accused and luckily had receipts as well
#MeLieToo
"Yup, the W always get a free ticket!!! Geez!"
If a person cry wolf. Life in prison.
"Why don't we ever hear about defamation lawsuits against women who try to ruin men?  You mess with me like that, i'm getting a judgement of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS! can't pay? Get out there on the streets and do what you do. always room for one more on Bissonnett. 😂"
"To deter this type of crime— give three times the penalty for false accusations/ allegations!!

Rape of woman = 10 years prison.
False rape allegations = 30 years.

I GUARANTEE you the false accusations would go way down."
The courts should just have you in a neutral ground until they find out what was true and or false before stamping the person as guilty or innocent.
"There are consequences for your actions, and women should not be immune"
Her dog stepped on a bee. To hall with Depp
don't forget about the harry potter spinoff movies he was a part of but got taken out of because of it.
Mgtow saves lives
Straight facts
Call this guy whatever but he aint lying.
"Here is the issue. Most of the time when there is an imbalance there is an over correction. It is true that prior to the metoo movement too often women were dismissed too often. However, believe all women is a good idea that was misused. 

To make it work it should've been believe all women COULD be telling the truth so all accusations should be investigated BUT it should always be anonymously investigated. So the accuser and accused should get the same anonymity. Only when there is a verdict of guilty can the anonymity be broken. Anyone who opposes this literally opposes innocent till proven guilty."
Been in that situation
Exactly
All claims from women on things like that  should not be believed but they should be investigated and if its found that she or he made false claims with malicious intent minium 10 years in prision and fines equaling the cost of the investigation would stop false claims in a day
So true...

"She makes a point about therapy for men, but in my experience (I work in mental health), men get better when they're DOING something, rather than just talking about their feelings. So many young men are single, unemployed, depressed, and feel powerless. They need to be doing something in their lives they can be proud of."
"“Women kept running and men got left behind” is a completely erroneous way of putting it. Women have been propped up by government and DEI initiatives of some form or another. It’s not that women have outrun men. It’s that men have been systemically hindered while women have been boosted. And this is not just in terms of admissions and hiring, it’s a psychological operation as well that has taught men to step aside and encouraged them to be more like women."
"It’s not merely that women left men behind, we chose to reshape society to place and keep women ahead. This systematic female favoritism is in schooling, the legal system, workplaces, technological development, publishing, banking, politics, and the military."
it drives me a little nuts how tradesmen are considered uneducated and for that are unattractive to women.......all the utilities are 99% work done by men.......our hardwork is being taken for granted
"""Choose emotionally healthy girls.""

Ah, great advice. So you are saying be on the hunt for the unicorn."
"""Do not participate in the hookup culture""

Ah, another amazing advice. In 2025 virtually all dating is hookup culture.
Then around the age of 32-38 about 10% of women wake up and desperately try to get themselves pregnant after a lifetime of hedonism, dozens of hookups, STDs, getting demolished by emotional wrecking balls, and so on.
Again the advice is to search for the unicorn - very useful, thanks!"
"Ive been a therapist for 12 years, mostly working with men in addiction. They are denied access to their kids, have no highly paying job opportunities, and are told they are toxic.

"There’s also 1 billion subsidies that support women at the cost of men.

Saying psychoanalytic therapy is the only way to deal with mental health struggles is like saying that we only need oxycodone to manage disease. Simple fact is different therapies are useful for different things.
"ok right off the bat I have criticisms about some of the assumptions made here. the idea that more women go to college means that women got ahead and men are being left behind is a blanket statement that needs to be dug into more: are they going to useful degrees, or are they just accumulating tremendous student debt? what about trades? Are we just going to continue the elitist view that a tradesman is less than a university graduate, even if that graduate degree is in interpretive dance therapy? Also the idea that this adversarial attitude started with MeToo is basically the previous generation saying ""oh no, MY version of feminism wasn't adversarial, it's just this latest wave"" when in reality I see a lot of animosity in my parents' generation, stemming from this ideology that basically treats women as defective men. the adversarial attitude has been subtly pushed by media for decades now; think of the idiot dad trope.

"I gotta say as a man of 54, i can identify with all of this stuff much earlier than some people. I had a mother who was a ground floor feminist, and she built a view of women in our house that they were supposed to be on a pedestal, and that they don't do wrong. It actually made my brother and I are a little afraid of women or maybe insecure is a better way to put it. Fast forward to nineteen eighty three I watched that same mother cheat on my father and destroy her entire family for another man and leave the family. Can you imagine what that did to a kid's mind When he learned the true nature of women? It took me years to unravel that and sometimes I still have trouble with it and I'd be lying if I said it didn't affect my relations with women. In my life i've managed to bed 15 different women. But I have to say there is a little bit of a love hate relationship with them inside me and it all goes back to my mother and the subject that you're talking about here"
"Pro/Con of this episode: +) she acknowledges boys are in bad shape in current culture. -) she sees the only solution as therapy, the cause of this entire mess we are in. It nearly ALL leads south, no matter how well meaning the therapist and subject. Actions matter and need scientific/practical correction, thoughts/feelings are spiritual territory. These therapists are now the clergy. Mostly atheists teaching us how to handle our spiritual reality."
One false allegation was enough for me. Never again.
"As a single dad (widower) raising 6 boys under the age of 9, and also having raised 6 who are now young adults, this was a topic I looked forward to listening to. Being a boy dad is all I've known for my entire adult life. Before having kids I worked with early school-age kids in the public school system, mainly assigned to work with unhappy kids struggling to adjust to the school routine. All the kids I was assigned to work with were boys and all of them felt like they didn't belong in the public school community. In hindsight I can see that I wasn't assigned to those kids because the teachers and admin staff believed I was specially talented at helping them. They simply didn't like the boys or want to waste their own time on them so they used me to keep the boys out of their hair. I could see early on that public school is built like a family, but a thoroughly dysfunctional one that favours some of the kids and pathologizes/scapegoats the rest - the boys. 

When my boys reached school age I tried the public system for a few years and assumed that because of my experience in the system working with troubled kids I couldn't possibly run into any problems with my own kids at school. However, I soon saw my boys as miserable as the troubled kids I'd worked with years earlier. I pulled the boys and started homeschooling. Such an easy solution. They have no exposure to any media, entertainment, schooling or devices that constantly convey the message that boys are defective faulty beings who can only become ""good"" by being more girl-like. They are simply free to grow up as boys without any interference attempting to distort their nature. It's how all boys were permitted to grow up before the woke assault on boys.

I enjoyed the early segments and was in strong agreement with some of Erica's points. As the discussion continued I felt myself drifting further away from her position. It felt like she was mainly trying to sell therapy. Erica recognizes that boys are being pathologized but then she pathologizes the solution to this problem. In her view bad therapies and bad systems create the problems, but then creating new ""good"" therapies and systems can fix them. I agree with your view that if people stop trying to break boys in the first place, in part by fixating on the world of therapies and labels, we wouldn't have such a large problem of having to fix them. Erica suggests that therapy is the antidote to being poisoned by these toxic systems while you (and I too) simply say: ""how about we don't poison the boys in the first place - then we don't need to use the antidote either.

While I wanted to agree more with Erica I felt myself drifting further away from her position and couldn't put my finger on why I felt that way. Toward the end her mask slipped and it became clear. When she made the statement that she didn't trust parents to know what's best for their kids she lost me entirely. And it looked like she lost you too at that moment but you politely allowed the interview to wind down without too much push-back on that.

I thought that statement about the role of parents was ludicrous. For two hours we heard how deconstructionists have created the chaos we see now in our schools and culture. We heard how parents who turn themselves into non-parents by being selfish, narcissistic or by abdicating their parental responsibilities to other non-parents, are the problem. The best solution is for kids to have two solid parents, a mother and father. But then by stating that she has no faith in parents, and wants to replace that role with a Utopian system run by an enlightened class, she essentially admits that she's for the deconstruction of the family. There is no greater act of deconstruction than the dismantling or undermining of the family and parental roles. 

I finally could see then why I couldn't get on the same page with Erica, in spite of wanting to so much. She has spent her working life as a priestess in the church of psychology and may feel that as long as kids are treated by people in her anointed class they may be saved. All other systems, classes, and the family too, cannot be trusted to be as competent at doing what the anointed therapy class can do. This is typical confused progressive Marxist garbage. 

How does the therapy class decide what is good and healthy for kids if they don't trust the parents? They decide on their own without the parents? Isn't this the very problem we have right now with the promotion of all the gender delusions in our schools? It feels too much like the invention of a new religion with a new anointed priest class that has decided it knows what is ""true"" or ""right"", but can only work if it can destroy all the religions that came before it. Deconstructionism.

Erica totally lost me on this. It is not for a woke academic to decide what is true or right, nor will they ever be more in tune to the needs of kids, and more motivated to meet those needs to the best of their ability, than that child's own parents.

Though I headed into this agreeing with the early segments, and by the end had some strong disagreements, I liked listening to this interview, and your others too. Most of my days the only conversations I hear are with boys under the age of 9 so spending a couple hours every now and then listening to one of my people helps me get my bearings back.😁"
"All your talk is about ""what to change on boys""..... Are you joking ? not a word on girls have to change ?????"
"@50:10 Why does she say no in response to “building all of the things”?

Men literally built all of the things. 

Odd"
"7:33 I feel like nearly everything she has said up to this point has been different from what I feel and my experience. Maybe it’s just me.

I’m not angry that my sons might be left behind. I’m angry that people have created systems which punish and reward people based on immutable character characteristics.

She acts like this stuff happened in a vacuum. Women just sprinted past men because… They are just fast?   No. That’s not why men are upset. That’s not why women with sons are upset.

They are upset because 53% of all workers in the United States were forced to take mandatory DEI trainings.  They’re upset because society has been telling boys and men that they are inherently bad.  They are upset because of the demonization of males, opportunities have been given to females not based on the virtue of merit or character, but by the virtue of the junk between their legs and the idea that men are inherently bad.

That’s what people are upset about. They’re not upset about being out done.  Men are really good at understanding and taking place in a hierarchy.  People are upset that it hasn’t been fair.

And they are upset that this unfairness to do great harm to both sons and daughters and the future has been brought about by weaponizing people’s real empathy, but even more importantly, they’re upset that it has been done by corrupt people benefiting from just wanting to look/feel good and virtuous while being anything but.

But I think the things that she says after that point makes sense generally speaking.

I agree with most everything else she says, although I think I might phrase things differently, personally, that’s not something I think is particularly important"
"The ONLY reason women ""got ahead"" is there's a huge thumb on the scale.  Take your thumb off the scale.  See what happens."
"It’s interesting the female therapist asks for more men in her field to help boys yet by nature of a man coming into such a female-dominated industry, they have to accept Academic Post Modern notions which could be contrary to fostering Masculinity and discourages men being men and boys being boys. I don’t think you can have both. The game is rigged. So enjoy the scoreboard, ladies🤷🏻‍♂️ good luck to us all."
"Why do these podcasters/influencers/whatever keep bringing on women to talk about men's problems, especially these big names that always get it wrong?"
The guest loses credibility when she minimizes the impact of divorce on children and tries to claim that the problem is that we just don't divorce well enough. That's simply not true.
A yacht is cheaper than a divorce Bro. Go sailing. 😂
Women took on the male role of CEO but they refused to take in the role of provider.  That is the problem.
"I am the father of two boys. Happily, well adjusted, fearless, and successful. Because of sports, i was able to interact with many parents. One woman, Asian, made a very insightful and interesting comment. She said, ""This country hasn't figured out how to raise their boys.""  The comment was made in 2010. Our sons were in the 10th grade."
"Ex Army JAG here. 38:15 is spot on; in my Brigade during 2020-2021, 40% of allegations were proven to be false . There were NO consequences for the false reporting since Command did not want to ""deter"" anyone from reporting.  It destroyed the lives of those who were falsely accused since the Army's culture is ""guilty until proven innocent"" (i.e. getting flagged, removal from favorable actions due to investigation, promotions suspended, schools suspended, etc. you are just stuck in limbo until it's all over (which could be up to a year). Approaching and making the first move has extreme risk attached to it since that movement."
"No.  No quotas, and don't rebalance classrooms.  It's up to men to build an education system for boys that gives them the academic hard skills.  But it also must let them get out, take risks and exhaust themselves.  Women may never be interested in us again.  But we can still choose to be excellent.  And working together in male hierarchies to overcome challenges is one of our real strengths that we'd better leverage."
"Just removing quotas would solve the issue. Women didn’t knock it out of the park, you were granted special dispensation on an unprecedented level. That’s why we’re in a slow motion collapse in direct correlation to your empowerment. 

Stop weighted admissions and special initiatives. Stop intersectionality, and this will be a corrected situation. You won’t though, too arrogant and secretly afraid."
Don’t listen to everything they are saying. Making the first move and she flips out is a very dangerous situation for the boy and must be avoided.
Men and modern women are not compatible.
"Women select, men struggle and compete to be selected. It's just men trying to navigate the social expectations that women impose. Men don't get to decide what those expectations are. We're never allowed to ask questions about women's expectations or their contribution to the given cultural arrangement, so there's just no solution. I don't know what to tell you."
"When John Papola talked about his son saying ""you don't know what it's like..."", his son was describing how he will be called out, judged and possibly ""shamed"" for ""making a move"" and most importantly, the mocking, shaming and judging  that will come form both men and women  if/when he gets rejected from making a move in the first place.
This is something that seriously needs to be discussed."
"They are not ""hating"" the ladies. They are demanding recompense and fair treatment. As they.should."
"I think the whole ""I won't even try to ask out that woman because she'll reject me anyways"" is so common in Gen Z."
"We don't have the issue that women kept running and men got left behind. Men were told we have to not only let women win. But we have to do the running for them. Round all the edges of competition. Blunt the sharpness of progress, and Tell men if they aren't willing to allow women to claim success during failure it is putting women down to make them feel inadequate. While not caring how hard men and boys try. They either produce or they are worthless. And telling boys the lies we tell girls don't work. Because that lie isn't enforced in the real world like it is for women and girls."
She lost me on the quotas.  DEI - gender version.  Hard pass.
12 minutes in and already this lady has no idea about boys.
The answer is “more top down social control”?
"She keeps on saying ""that girl is not a mentally healthy girl"". Yes, we are aware of that but it's not going to protect the boy from the charge of rape destroying his life. She really needs to be more practical in terms of her advice. How do you identify mentally unhealthy people, because I struggle to do that at the age of 60 ?"
"Some questions. 

1: Given that so many modern women wake up angry and consider anger a source of power, I am curious about why they think male anger is so inappropriate. 

2: Boys and men are subjected to injustice, they are not treated fairly, rules are often tilted in girl's favour, I'd  like to know which other emotion is more appropriate than anger?

3: Do these people realise how unpleasant, joyless and exploitative the experience of dating modern women can be for the average man?

4: Do they understand just how pointless it is trying to date women who often have standards for men that gods cannot meet? 

5: Why do they expect men to meekly go back to a marriage model that even they know is totally broken, abused for personal gain, highly destructive and toxic to the family unit men are expected to build and protect?

6: It's true that a few men are angry at women, it's also true that huge numbers of men just find these women unattractive and this gets reclassified as anger, not disinterest, despite all the evidence that men are not pursuing certain types of women in the numbers that those women expect. Why aren't they seeing this?"
I like most of what this woman guest is saying except for the part that therapy is the answer for everything. Sounds a little self-serving. Especially for young men therapy is definitely not the answer. Mentorship from other men is what is the answer a young boy needs other men around him to figure out how to be a man.
There’s a program being introduced in UK schools to  combat misogyny in men and boys. I’d like to know how that’s going to help. It’s going to make men retreat from society even more . Doubling down with feminist misandry isn’t going to be taken well by men and boys.
"Boys being held back, but why? And by who and what mechanisms? Asking questions like these gets you quickly labeled as an “ist” or “phobe”. The sad part is, when you try to explain this to someone (especially a woman) they often don’t see a problem with it."
"Vehemently disagree with you on Family court catastrophising.  I've been through it and fought only for my kids with a severely mentally I'll mother making every false allegation under the sun and they still awarded custody to her and my kids now no-longer speak to either of us.  The fact that the Court would not apply simple decency and consequences for her terrible behavior AND the fact that my experience is demonstrably and consistently repeated through the Wester world, shows a genuine lack of empathy and seriousness about re-promoting marriage."
"Calling boys “fragile” implies a kind of inherent weakness or instability—like they break easily and need protecting.

But “reactive” is far more accurate and balanced. It describes a response style, not a flaw. It means boys might be more sensitive to stimuli, social dynamics, or emotional triggers, but it doesn’t frame them as weak—it frames them as more responsive to their environment. That can look like withdrawal, intensity, impulsivity, or hyper-awareness—not fragility.

And here’s something important:

Yes, biologically, boys are less resilient in early childhood. That’s not a flaw—it’s genetics. With only one X chromosome, they’re more vulnerable to developmental issues, neurological disorders, and complications early in life. Even into adulthood, women show greater resilience to disease and illness, while men tend to have greater resistance to physical trauma and injury.

That’s not opinion—that’s the biological tradeoff.

But it’s often misunderstood or misused.


The reason “fragile” gets used more often could be because:

1. Psychoanalytic language leans emotive – It’s trying to evoke compassion, but sometimes ends up sounding pathologizing.


2. There’s a cultural undercurrent of framing boys’ mental health through dysfunction or crisis, rather than development or adaptability.


3. “Fragile” supports a caretaking narrative—but at the cost of seeing boys as fundamentally broken, instead of complex and reactive to unmet needs, stress, or chaotic environments.

“Reactive” opens the door to deeper questions:

What are boys reacting to?
What expectations shape their expression?
What gets repressed or misunderstood?
What kind of support builds better responses?

She tries to point out bias narratives but then instinctively chooses not to reframe unfair narratives— id rather not to deny struggle, but to understand it and make room for strength"
I liked the point about female superheroes being a copy and paste of their male counterparts. Made me think of why the titular character Nausicaa from the valley of the wind is so well written. She's the female ideal. She's a strong caring leader that inspires men though her refined feminine qualities.
It is fascinating watching this once great society come unraveled. What a time to be alive!
"When I was growing up in the late ‘80s and into the ‘90s, there were so many boys being placed on Ritalin. I didn’t have ADD; I was dealing with anxiety and a lack of interest in some of the topics we were covering. That problem has only become worse since then, unfortunately."
"""Make sure, if who you're dating is mentally healthy!"", is the quote of the century!!!!!!💪"
"The moment she said women were disempowered at some point in history so it was a good thing we empowered them, this tells me she believes the feminist revisionist history.

I would push back and question, were women actually disempowered? Or did they have all the power they needed to be women and they just weren’t satisfied with just being women?"
Feminist movement “A little misdirected???” Are u kidding 😂😂😂#denial #NOSCCOUNTABILITY
I agree with so much of what this woman says but therapy is not the solution. You can’t train therapists that will help with the current schools. Therapy programs are pumping out terrible therapists. She seems to have no idea of how bad the current schools are when it comes to training therapists. I got my masters in clinical mental health and did not learn anything of value
"Christianity is the only religion that teaches other-centered behavior. And equality in marriage. That is what has changed in our society. Everyone is narcissistic in relationships. Never what we can do for our spouse, but what they can do for us."
"Being a therapist doesn't mean she's not a woman.
Caring about women and women's issues doesn't mean one can't reject feminism. Those two things aren't synonymous."
"I saw a therapist tell the Dad Saves America guy that men need to look for women who are emotionally healthy, that aren’t “paranoid and persecuted”, and that aren’t afraid of their feminine side. I would say the same goes for guys…I had to learn this myself back when I came of age in the 90s and 00s, that a man needs to not be afraid of his masculine side too—he has to have those good male qualities that give him confidence and conviction that avoids him falling into “nice guy syndrome”, like you were saying. Men are at their best when they’re kind, but being nice is not a good place to be because you aren’t in touch with your masculinity enough to say no when you need to, or to express any negative emotions in healthy and appropriate ways. So there are plenty of messed up women and men alike, and both can work on themselves to improve, and they must also work on their ability to identify the emotionally broken people and the emotionally well people, and deal with their issues so that they are not attracted to the emotionally unstable persecuted or mean people who just bring chaos into people’s lives. And above all, men and women both gotta stop jumping on each other right away because sex makes all of this a million times more difficult…you’ve basically bonded yourself to someone before you’ve evaluated whether you should bond yourself to them."
"31:00 it's the progressive ideology, the same ideology that did the french revolution, and the soviet revolution, just read their books, read brave new world, this was the objective from the beginning."
"What Erica explains at 10:05 is important to explain why girls & boys should be separated early in education. I’ve worked with young kids, little boys are more physical due to testosterone & need more physical playtime so they are able to focus better when learning."
Tradesmen used to be respected and provided a very good quality of life...they've been utterly broken and disregarded....it's not only at levels of university or college
15:53 My friend pulled her son out of Kindergarten because he was so stressed out by all the standardized testing. She home schooled him all the way through. He graduated this year.
"That’s why we don’t commit anymore.  We work all day to come home to problems. Women today have the expectation that they will be a stay at home wife and the man is still supposed to work all day, pay her way through life, then come home cook, clean, and serve her because other single women on the internet deluded her into thinking that she’s a 10 when she’s a solid 4 on her best day.  Occasionally getting laid isnt worth all the problems, bills and stress"
"Erica seems very knowledgable and intelligent.  It's troubling to hear her speak of government as if it's an entity that has a role to play.  Government is nothing more that millions of individuals (many corrupted and perverse) claiming authority (illegitimate in most cases), and credibility (unwarranted in most cases).  One does not have to be a libertarian to recognize this.  What it does require is for parents, and society to take responsibility and stop wanting someone else to take care of them.  One could argue that part of why we face so many crisis in society results from a mindset of needing to be protected or taken care of (female/infantile trait?) by somebody or something else.  It's one thing to voluntarily take in information, or to take advantage of aligned resources, but it's completely unacceptable to claim authority to dictate.  I find Ericas assertion that individuals in government have the legitimate authority to tell me what I or my children can consume, and at what age.  It's this Erica mindset that delivers us into authoritarianism, and tyranny.  Good intentions or not, she is deranged and delusional, and this is precisely the sort of people we need to prevent from having power."
"Here is your problem - your understanding of hook-up culture and situationships. Hook-up culture and situationships are for successful men, not for the normal guy. A guy with choice will have women stay in situationships since committing to one girl would be a bad choice for him. If you are a woman, and you feel like the guy isn't committing to you, and you describe your relationship as situationship, it's most likely because you are swinging beyond your league. That guy won't ever commit, you are very likely his side-chick and not much more."
This is all good news for handymen.  Lots and lots of women living alone that need things fixed. Men suddenly have value when the kitchen sink is clogged.
"The advice she's giving here should be directed 100% towards the women: as they decide everything right from the onset of who to ""take to dinner."" 
Men have 0 agency in the decisions women choose or not choose to make."
"51:43
Yeah.  Youve seen the result of men having their space, and over 30+ years wahmen have destroyed every single one of them."
"Some men told us we have to work on us but we never heard someone told a woman you have to work on you, so they take pity and blame other, the government funds women, forced women to run and tight us on a chair by blaming us to warch the run. And women comes to spit on our face to not get on her standards and men we have to accept that behavior. Why men are divided to not support each other , level up together and help each other"
"..and water is wet. how is it that I have been aware of all this for twenty years. Books, articles lecture, intellectuals, they have all be sounding the alarm, screaming in to the void. At this point, these conversations are interesting and I wish Erica the best, but at some point I think it is safe to say that society considers men disposable, men had the upper hand for a long time and now that they're down there seems to be some sadistic enjoyment from people with influence, bottom line nothing is going to change becuase nobody gives a shit. 
All of society, ""There's a problem with X group, lets fix X by supporting, creating programs, changing the systems to help the marginalised class, give money to fix it"".. 
All of society towards men, ""What is wrong with you? Why don't you pick yourself up by your bootstraps? Don't be a loser. Sit down, shut up, take this pill and get on with it""
Yes, it is all broken on all levels, not just school and frankly nothing will change becuase at the root of it men are disposable and nobody gives a shit about men except for mothers who care for their sons and that just doesn't cut it."
Men do well in groups... (First rule: We don't talk about Fight Club)

"""Bad Dating advice for young men""   I watched Rocky with my son and daughter when they were older teenagers. The scene where Rocky stops Adrianne from leaving the apartment by putting his arm across the door was one of the most romantic scenes of the 80's. He loves her, she loves him, but she wanted to leave because of her own fear and insecurity. He pushed her boundaries, they fell in love and that became the main story line.  Both my kids felt he had crossed the line, and called it assault and ""kidnapping.""  He had no intention of hurting her but knew she had to get out of her ""comfort zone"" and move forward.  That scene is integral to the movie. Nowadays there would have been no boxing match as Rocky would have been incarcerated that night. Sad that youth cannot see that. And sad that women are seen as victims in every situation."
The thesis statement of the guest is obnoxious.
"To any guy feeling down about not being able to get involved with a woman, very very few are anything close to relationship material in 2025."
"The industry that I trained for routinely has networking events for exclusively women, non binary people, lbtq+ people, non white people. I’ve never seen a networking event exclusively for white strait men, not saying that we need it; I’d personally prefer if there was no networking events based on identity, but even in the events that include my identity I feel looked over or outright rejected. Maybe that’s internalized self hatred I’ve developed in my 24 years of living, but goddamn does it feel impossible to be a punching bag anymore especially when the product of a majority of larger companies are outright failing. It feels like I wasn’t given the opportunity, and on top of that the people that where are destroying the future opportunities I could have had."
"She fails (or refuses) to touch on the point of how extremely hateful women have become towards men. Especially online. Why would you even bother if, for the past 20 years, you've heard almost nothing but hateful things about yourself?"
"Because of YT censorship there's no way that I or anyone else can actually tell you what you missed, the half truths and the whole lies that were told and I personally am not even allowed to post more than one sentence any more."
Time for men and boys to say no.  Stop government harrassment or persection under Title IX.  Girls and women are stand up to Title IX persecution for speaking up for fair competition and safety from trans in female sports.
School was hell 30 yrs ago. Bet not much has changed. The army was less violent
Men got left behind or held back???
"It has affected all men. I don’t ever talk to women at work after metoo. And arms length in personal relationships. Being in entertainment, seeing how destructive that pendulum swung as to weaponize women against men, I’m forever changed. Nothing that swings the other way will ever make me trust interaction again. I feel VERY sorry for young boys that went through this."
Has anyone ever seen an emotionally and mental balanced woman? 😂
Feminism gained unstoppable power through a sisterhood and all for one and one for all mentality. That shows no signs of abating.
She really sounds like she nose what she's talking about
"Couldnt prove her allegations in court so she says he ""got away with it""

Its innocent until proven guilty. Not guilty the moment a woman says something against you.

They shouldnt allow charges to even be laid without evidence. This is ridiculous."
how many woman get away with false accusations tho?
There was no evidence
Allegations are like currency to them.
"Associated Press, This is amazing! I can't stop smiling!"
No respect for anyone who picks and chooses when to speak out.
Nobody is checking for her…
"She deserves to be condemned for creating a hate movement that destroyed many innocents lives and careers. No one, ESPECIALLY w0m3n, should ever be believed off their word alone. Innocent until proven guilty."
When did they overturn  it?   I never knew.

The people in this comments section need to go behind bars.
Everytime i see who is the founder. I just smh..

Maybe their low conversations because most are false
What about the false allegations?
expressly when women lie about it and get away with it

"Where can I report?

My landlord was ex navy. The navy doesnt prosecute rape. So the unwanted touches, gender based violence and stalking erupted into ritual abuse aimed at ruininh my life incrementally for some sick fetish. I see the innuendo in apparently ""harmless"" looking erotic videos for instance. But the undertext is a malicious serenity that could involve fetishes you can easily witness in virtual economies. Nightmarish experimentations and tech and biohacking. Ie: Neurolab

When I claimed to have unwanted touch by this 3 letter agency to the point of seriously altering my physique and payche, I was gaslit by many misogynists - told I wasnt ""special enough"" and dismissed as a ""victim"" by positivity spiritists.

 I dont want my comment censored because I feel my survival is a miracle during these times of #metoo and missing murdered indigenous women. My besties arent alive so I know they knew the same people. Can anyone help? I had a gun in my back too..the touch was frustratingly pernicious"
The ‘Lee Millers’ of the world have always existed. The milieu has changed and that’s what’s happening. Let’s not be tainted by movements and let it happen naturally by recognizing it for what valor. Would love to see more stories like Jane Addams come to the silver scene.
Men it would seem (by our nature perhaps) simply are unaware of their partner in a way that women are aware of the other person in the relationship. We are real to each other in different ways but equally respected

Megyn you look very nice in your outfit 😁
"I am 69 yrs. I was taught manners and courtesy and respect. So when a woman finds it offensive that a man opened a door for her, I shake my head and wonder how society has sank this low. 
Btw… my grandson is a freshman in high school and he apparently has his first ever girlfriend. Her dad saw my grandson open a door for his daughter, and that girl’s dad told my son at a wrestling meet that my grandson was the most well mannered kid he’d ever seen. so apparently it can be passed on from generation to generation and we need more of it."
I compliment my female employees for looking nice all the time . I don’t give AF.
“Some People’s” Whole Identity Is To Be A Victim!!
"Had a receptionist once, in a casual dress workplace. Shirts with a collar, clean jeans with no holes and track shoes were the norm. She never strayed from that and never wore makeup kept her hair in a ponytail.  After more than a year like this, I came in and did a doubletake when I saw her. Hair done up, makeup,nice dress,jewelry etc. I said, ""Wow. You look nice today."" I continued to my office and didn't think anything more about it. A week later I got a summons. She told the judge how ""violated"" she felt. I told the judge what happened. He looked at her and said, ""You need to grow y and learn what a compliment is."""
A lot of emotional hemophiliacs out there - the slightest thing makes them bleed.
"Totally agree, to sensitive,to the point of ridiculous , l take a compliment anytime of the day, if it’s done respectfully."
I soooo totally agree with you megyn!
"Three years ago I got leaner and put more muscle. A female executive, stated you are looking real good. It was nice to hear . However I would never say that to female coworker. That would a HR compliant"
Make Compliments Chivalrous Again!
"When you actually listen, most of the stories are that petty. Women are raised to hate men therefore anything a man does that gives a woman attention that she doesn't want is bad even when the attention isn't bad and even if he can't know and even if she would like it if it was a different guy (again he can't know)

A good example of how women have lost their mind due to feminism is that video of a woman walks in new York for 10 hours and it claimed that smiling was harassment and so on."
I miss the compliments.
"I know a girl that reported her boss to HR because he said that the color of her new lipstick looks nice on her. 

I rolled my eyes"
"That girl is not offended by the guy who is six feet tall, makes six figures, and has a six-pack.    Her ""honor"" is not insulted by that man."
So right on so freaking sad 😢

The best thing to ever happen to Megyn Kelly and Tucker Carlson was leaving FOX news and the mainstream media all together.  They are AWESOME unleashed!!!😂😂
I no longer complement women on anything. Never will again.
beautiful and absolutely stunning voice i love listening to  you !!
"One woman co-worker complained to HR for sexual harassment when one of the guys said to her ""good morning  - you look great this morning"".
HR warned him so the next day he said ""good morning  - you look bad this morning, are you ok?"". HR dismissed her following complaints"
People will soon walking around saying nothing to nobody
"I agree with you Meghan, it is a movement about someone's ulterior motives."
"Yep! But at the same time and breath!:
Female: ""I'm getting sick of Not Being RECOGNISED in My Job or in the WORK I'M Doing!"""
My ex sister in law would get upset over stupid shit like this. I never understood.
"I appreciate compliments!  BE MEN, MEN!  Screw the toxic whiners!"
It was never about the right thing ..
Society got way too sensitive and many wanted the attention that being a victim brings with it. Just my 2 cents 🤷🏻‍♀️
Megyn is gorgeous in her outfit and I would love to buy her dinner.
Make chivalry accepted again.
Well said Megan
Thank you so much for your incites into President Trump and your no bologna comments. Keep it coming! ❤❤❤
"As the “MeToo” movement began to gain momentum it made me think of the French Revolution. It started as a legitimate pushback against very real instances of oppression, but it quickly escalated to the point that any poor person could make an accusation against someone who was rich or in a position of power or influence, with no burden of proof. It’s understandable that the one making the claim is given the benefit of the doubt because so often there is no proof. However, the willingness to always believe peasant then or the woman today is that it creates an environment where innocent people are assumed guilty. 

Some women have ulterior motives. They may want revenge against someone who dumped them or wasn’t interested in them. Some want attention or money, or to get him fired so she or someone she loves can get his job. Sometimes it’s a case of mistaken identity. Sadly, many women have been sexually abused in some way sometime in their lives. It’s easy for them to be on the defensive and assume that men are dangerous, so they are predisposed to take anything a man says or does as sexual and therefore inappropriate. And then there are those women who are mentally ill, who may genuinely believe a man has abused them in some way when they’ve never even met each other.

It’s simply not wise to automatically take one side or the other. Accusations need to be carefully considered case by case. Even then it’s sometimes not clear what the truth is.

I’m very glad to hear Megyn Kelly address this issue."
"I appreciate when men compliment me if I look good or if women compliment me if I look good, and I do the same to other people. It doesn’t matter the gender, if someone looks good, complement!"
Yes!!!
Does it matter if the boss is a female?
"Nigel in Canada 🇨🇦
apparently no one cares what Canadians think, but ?"
"With most modern day movements, it had good intentions but went way too far quickly. I think that those people jumped on board the worse it got. The human experience: we just mess things up."
"When ""you look nice"" became demonized I switched to ""You look tired"" women love that!"
"It's at the point we just don't talk to women at work anymore.  Simply, do this, this and that.  Work conversation only!!"
That's right ✅️
"It's like that joke, kinda.  Where a guy named Frank, was at the office water cooler.  A female co-worker was near him.  Frank inhaled deeply and said, ' Your hair smells beautiful.'  The woman stormed off, straight to HR.  HR said, so why was it wrong of Frank to compliment you, on how beautiful your hair smelt???
She replied, 'Frank, is 3ft tall!'"
I'm a respectful old man and when I see a lovely woman I am going to compliment with honor
So well said!
One of the first steps to handling sexual harassment allegations was informing the other individual that their compliments or action were unwanted.
"Sadly, some people think others have a hidden agenda.  A compliment, most times, is just that.       IMO"
Well said as usual Mrs Megyn!!
Bang On
"""Sexism,"" ""racism,"" ""harassment"" are getting more debased every second, and I love it."
Maybe she shouldn’t have worn a dress maybe she should’ve worn slacks so it wasn’t so revealing
Overcorrection. Absolutely rampant.
"Such a good explanation of how certain movements ‘over correct’ and the results of doing so, Megyn."
So true!
Amen perfectly explained.
GGOO EVENING TO MAGA MEGYN AND CREW 👍🙂👍
Their goal was self enrichment not fighting any cause.
I don't compliment women at all anymore to specifically avoid this kind of situation.
😢 Indeed... the 'TIME' to PAY someone a COMPLIMENT is while you are ALIVE ❤️!!!
"When I was younger I was afraid to complement a stranger on their looks or attire, for fear that they would take it as me trying to hit on them. Now that I am an old man I do it regularly and watch as I lift their spirit."
"A parallel universe in life. Two men, one ugly, one handsome can give the same compliment to a woman, and the woman will respond completely different to the two men. Ugly men get hauled down to HR in corporate America every day and handsome men don't. The way of the world."
"They never intended it be “noble” causes. Their intention was to control how we think, feel, and do."
"Come on Megyn, we all remember that YOU were a big part of starting the me too movement.  I do have to applaud you for being one of the first news anchors to stand up and point out that things were getting out of hand though."
"To disarm this...
ask the woman if she wears makeup to work.
When she answers ""yes"", you then ask her ""why?""
Then you get the ""zero divided by zero"" look."
I had a charge against me for complimenting an employee in her dress.
"Yes Female look good in dresses, that is a compliment !"
Impressive to see a public figure come out with what a moral social observer has been realizing. Kelly you are wonderful with justice
I've Learned Not To Speak To Lady's.
"Omniscience, a kayaker from Wisconsin got caught faking his death, living in another country, georgia. Thank you Megyn Kelly the Lord is still with you 😇🤓🤓🤓🇺🇸🇮🇱🙏😇"
What he was really saying was “appreciate you taking the time to dress professionally for work.”
"1. What he said: “You look nice in that dress.”
2. What she heard: “And you’d look even better out of it.”"
"I was in the Army in 1992.
We had to do a sensitivity and sexual harrassment training.
Being young adults we handled it like a bunch of juvenile delinquents 😂
But what has stayed with me all these years is how easy it is to be misunderstood, misinterpreted, or offensive when you simply meant to be complimentary or joking.
Offensive behaviour is in the eye and ear or the beholder.
What one person considers a compliment or a funny comment, another person may consider a personal attack.
And unfortunately, two people flirting consenually, may find themselves in trouble if an un-included third party observer gets offended by their words or actions.
That was in 1992.
Things have gotten so much worse since then.
I am surprised people speak or look at one another at all these days."
I miss the days of  just saying have a nice day to someone without the repercussion of that person being offended
It's gone so far I'm hesitant to even speak to a woman nowadays
Because we're all too emotionally weak
Also financially beneficial
"I almost always compliment women who are dressed up, especially my wife."
I agree one hundred percent
Megyn Kelly looks fantastic in everything she wears.
"When I was working in construction I commented to a woman in the office that we were both wearing kaki, only hers fit better because mine were carpenters pants nothing more. I was called in the office the next morning."
"They complain when complimented on how they look, but then complain because a man didn’t hold the door open for her!!"
"How do we make this work? Many men don't understand that hitting on women can be completely unwanted and inappropriate dependingon setting, circumstances and a person. However a nice compliment isn't necessarily the same as hitting on women. I mean the guy could be complimenting in a creepy agressive way OR in a perfectly genuine and honest and lightweight way that isn't in any way inappropriate. This isn't so clear cut. But how do we solve this in a healthy way? I don't mind appropriate compliments at all. But I have received a lot of unwanted male attention that I rather would not have had to deal with. I think people need to learn to read the room."
There is good and evil in all of us.
Remember when you were advised to complement people in the work force and in your family to be thoughtful
So men aren’t allowed to compliment a lady on their dress without retaliation???
"It's not what you say sometimes, but how you say it.  I have been told the same thing and got the same vibe this woman got, & I'm no feminist. So just because you never experienced it Megyn does not mean that someone else hasn't."
"I loathe having to text this but I do not say anything to women anymore. I might say hello or good morning— you can get yourself in trouble lawfully for just being polite. 
  I’m 64 now, been married, single now—whatever. A while after our divorce, I held a door for a lady to a business as i was exiting and she was about to enter. She looked at me with complete disdain and disgustingly said “that she was perfectly capable of opening the door herself”! 
  So I politely shut the door so she could open it  herself and I turned and walked away.
  A little embarrassed by that because several people were around and they stopped and watched.
  I will never forget that."
💯  true story being a bully
This is because there is a sense of glory in being a victim. It can pull sympathy from perfect strangers. This spits on true victims.
"Political Correctness needs to experience ""Cancel Culture"" !"
Love it
"Like the soldier who kissed the nurse at the end of WW2? The woman came out and said ""No""! It was a joyous day, he didn't assault me ""! But they just had to deface the statue!"
You’ve not read black lies matter “vision” and “manifesto” right in front on their website.
"You are  totally right!
And Beautiful!"
Tragically that's the way it is now. Men (myself included) are afraid to interact with women at least at work because we can be so easily destroyed. More and more men are refusing to even date anymore let alone commit to a woman. It's just too dangerous.
Nothing new here. I retired from a big 3 company in 2002. I was a supervisor and by then had reached the point where I would say nothing to my female workers other than business. Never compliment a woman on her clothing. Women generally spend a lot in clothing - for what purpose? To be noticed? God forbid a make co-worker or boss mention that. I saw too many colleagues dragged in front of HR  for the most innocent of comments on appearance.
Oh brother.
"Le seul comportement à avoir face à une victime, c'est de lui dire : je t'écoute et on va enquêter rapidement"
"""C'est l'enfer.""
Elle a fait plusieurs centaines de plateau télé pour vendre son livre, y a pire comme enfer."
"Il faut qu'elle arrete de se poser en victime , elle qui differencie les morts d'enfants😢"
"Fourest : ""je suis journaliste""

Affirme des choses non sourcées et généralise abusivement des cas exceptionnels comme s'ils méritaient un livre médiatique grand publique.

On a déjà des discussions publiques dans les milieux militants et connexes pour discuter de ça et chercher des solutions et s'imaginer que des jeunes militantes et militants seraient pas armés pour éviter de tomber dans les abus c'est mal les connaitre.
Tout comme s'imaginer que si on est plus expérimentés on tombe forcément moins dans les excès ou les biais.

Alerter sur les abus c'est bien si c'est dans la nuance et traiter de façon proportionnelle à la réalité du problème mais pourquoi en faire un livre qui sert la soupe au publique réactionnaire ? Jamais ça ne touchera le publique qui pourrait bénéficier de l'alerte qu'on prétend lancer et au contraire ça donne des prétextes et des armes aux antiféministes pour lutter contre le féminisme qu'ils n'accepteront jamais.

On peut percevoir des réaction comme étant extrémistes ou dogmatiques alors qu'on est dans divers biais qui nous font voir des choses bien différentes de la réalité. Surtout quand on prend de l'âge et qu'on se met a déconsidérer les jeunes parce qu'ils seraient excessifs alors qu'ils n'ont rien de différent des précédente générations et que c'est plutôt l'observateur ou l'observatrice qui n'a pas sut évoluée et progresser avec la société.

La position de Fourest semble tellement déconnectée de la réalité, semble plus dans un raisonnement abstrait que basé sur des réalité mesurées et confrontées a l'esprit critique pour éviter divers biais dont un des pires est le biais de modération.

Bon il serait un peu naïf de croire que Fourest n'a pas l'intelligence et la maitrise sociale pour constater que son travail médiatique pose problème d'un point de vue féministe. J'ai du mal a croire que éthiquement elle ne sacrifie pas (ou a déjà sacrifié) certains idéaux pour les bénéfices matériels et d'influence."
"Personne ne semble oser critiquer un grand coupable dans toute cette histoire : l’institution judiciaire. A force de ne pas condamner, à force de nier les victimes et d’aider les coupables, la population en vient à vouloir se faire justice elle-même, avec ses propres moyens : les réseaux sociaux. Cela concerne éminemment l’affaire d’Outreau, dont le déroulé et le rôle terrible de m Dupont Morretti alimentent considérablement la défiance des gens vis à vis de l’institution."
"Caroline Fourest parle en son nom,n'a pas la légitimité de juger le bien-fondé des plaintes,des procédures et des actions du mouvement Metoo. 
Il y a une nécessité absolue à :
- accueillir écouter proteger et soutenir les victimes 
- s'opposer à la culture du viol et à toutes les violences systèmiques
- développer des reseaux d'investigations judiciaires, actions de formation et de prevention, accompagnements médico-scolaires et sociaux"
Comment apporter un quelconque  crédit à Caroline  Fourest qui dit à qui veut l'entendre qu'une mort palestinienne ne vaut pas une mort israélienne .....
"Que dit Caroline Fourest du fait qu'une écrasante majorité des plaintes soit classée sans suite, ""faute de preuves""?"
"Fourest monte en epingle quelques cas exceptionnels marginaux, comme si c'etait le probleme principal. C'est malhonnete"
Caroline Fourest c'est l'exemple type de l'effet Dunning-Kruger. Une personne incompétente qui tend à surestimer son niveau de compétence !
je peux lui trouver 3 exemples de proches  femmes qui ont commit diverses formes de mensonges a ce sujet  si elle cherche des témoignages de fausses accusations
"Parmi les ""victimes"" de dénonciation nommées par C. Fourest, il y a un producteur de cinéma, A. Terzian, qui a versé plus de 200000 € à C. Fourest pour un projet de film, qui -heureusement - ne s'est pas fait. Hasard ?"
Lol.elle c'était fait bannir sur France 2 dans l'émission de Ruquier pour mensonges repetes...bref elle n'a pas changé
On connaît Fourest il n'y a pas de commentaire à faire
"Caroline Fourest n'a aucun autre but à chaque fois que de faire le buzz pour aller faire le tour des plateaux. Elle est prête à tout pour ça, méprisable."
comparer une main aux fesses au viol de mazan c'est quand même pas très respectueux pour cette pauvre femme qui en a été victime - il n'y a plus de nuance .
Fourest : 🤮🤮🤮🤮
"4:52: ""Dans 99% des cas ce Je t'écoute doit être un Je te crois"", Ok Caroline donc l'intérêt de faire une livre sur les 1% c'est quoi exactement? On rappelle les chiffres officiels : 1% des cas de viol/ agression son traités. Le reste ça tombe en non lieu ou la plainte n'est pas déposée (pour tout un tas de raison que MeToo a mis en éclairage). C'est ça la Réalité aujourd'hui."
"Fourest représente la définition l'opportunisme. Elle sait très bien que certaines personnes sont fatiguées d'entendre la succession  des plaintes d'agressions sexuelles (qui résulte de la libération de la parole) et se sentiront rassurées à travers son ouvrage. 
Je lui repose de faire dans deux ans un ouvrage intitulé ""Comment le mouvement me too a été étouffé ""."
"""Les femmes ne mentent pas plus que quiconque"". Merci en tant qu'avocate d'avoir apporté cette précision..."
"Les conséquences de son livre vont être dramatiques. Les femmes ont tellement galéré à se faire entendre, et elle, elle débarque de nulle part pour dire des conneries, alors qu'elle se prétend journaliste ! Tu ne te prétends pas de droite, mais tu vas être très étonnée d'être appréciée de ce côté d'un coup. Le même discours que Thaïs Escuffion"
pour moi on est coupable quand on a été juger coupable  par la justice !!!!! la vindicte populaire non merci !!!!!
"Caroline Fourest est une meilleure avocate que Anne Bouillon qui ""ne croit pas"" la sincerite de Caroline Fourest qui pose de vraies questions si notre societe ne veut pas se transformer en tribunal sur les reeaux qui, comme nous le savons,  est un receptacle qui peut mettre en danger ses adeptes."
"Bravo Caroline fourest, et courage, de te battre contre la bêtise de masse. Quand l'avocate dit qu'il faut croire sur parole les femmes qui se disent victimes de viol, sans enquête sans jugement ca ne choque personne ?
Elle affirme qu'elle ne""connait aucune femme qui accuserai à tort pour salir une réputation..."" Merci de ton témoignage mais on s'en fou. Et donc on ne peut pas imaginer qu'une femme cupide sans honneur sans foi ni loi accuse un homme pour le plumer ? Ca ne peut pas exister?
Mais quelle faiblesse d'esprit. Il faudrait vraiment que les études supérieures, basent leur sélection plus sur de l'intelligence plutôt que sur la mémoire, ce n'est pas possible de voir de tels avocats, il faut arrêter de donner du pouvoir à des gens avec aussi peu de jugeote."
"Une main aux fesses vaut 5 ans de prison alors que des centaines de milliers de dealers de cocaïne se promènent dans les rues tranquillement, relaxés ou laissés en liberté! Cette avocate est une honte."
"Il y a clairement très peu de victimes qui sont mal intentionnées. En revanche, il y a des personnes, peu importe leur genre, qui ont des problèmes psys qui peuvent les entrainer à imaginer, exagérer, mélanger. Il y a des phénomènes de foules où les gens portent des jugements sur des personnes dont ils viennent d'apprendre l'existence. Il faut donc s'interdire de négliger la parole des victimes, comme ça a été trop souvent fait, parce que ça nous arrangerait. La parole des victimes est à écouter et à prendre au sérieux. Mais à l'heure des fake news, on ne croit pas aveuglément, non."
"Tu vois, l'affaire M'bappé est un bel exemple de ce que Fourest raconte. C'est devenu un peu facile, le viol est devenu une arme par des gens mal intentionnés, et cela dessert ceux qui sont vraiment victimes de viols."
"Fourest qui trouvent normal que les bombardements israéliens provoquent des dégâts collatéraux, trouve inconcevable que certaines accusations sont le fait de femmes malades et tout à fait minoritaires. Et du coup ce petit nombre qui doit être condamné justifie de discréditer tout le mouvement féministe et Meetoo en particulier."
Honteux la manière dont Catherine Fourest se victimise
"Si un homme, ou une femme, venait voir cette avocate en lui expliquant qu'on l'accuse à tort de harcèlement, j'aimerais connaître son sentiment."
Oui faut condamné sévèrement les pointeurs mais c'est pas simple quand c'est parole contre parole sans aucune autre preuve et c'est pas au médias de jouer au procureur comme madame rousseau qui dénonce bayou a c a vous sans plainte n'y rien sa rappelle staline ou les délateurs pendant la seconde guerre mondiale
"je ne suis ni pour l'une ni pour l'autre mais pour les victimes et toutes les victimes des deux cotés.
Ne pas vouloir admettre et concevoir que certain(s) certaine(s) puisse(nt) instrumentaliser une accusation en faux. C'est la même chose que généraliser et dire que tout les hommes sont des violeurs. 
La lois ne prévoirait pas le délit de diffamations et de faux témoignages si tout le monde disaient la vérités"
"La duplicité de Fourest consiste à ce que d'un côté,dans des débats comme ceux-ci, on entend quelque chose d'étayé.

D'un autre côté en revanche, son livre fournit aux pourfendeurs réactionnaires de Metoo un argumentaire pour etayer leurs propres idées. Et c'est celà que diffuse un tel livre dans la société.

Et cela, elle ne met pas d'énergie à venir le corriger, au contraire."
"Une main !!?? Pas une agression ,voyons.... plutôt un compliment ! Les affreuses ne risquent rien ! C'est tellement évident. 😂🎉🎉"
"Je suis une jeune femme (24 ans), j'ai une amie qui a été agressée sexuellement par un homme, en voyant toutes les procès de viol qui se tiennent depuis le mouvement Metoo, cela me fait perdre espoir en les hommes quelques fois (je ne vous le cache pas), mais je reste convaicu qu'il peut y avoir certaines dérives du mouvement. Il faut vraiment être stupide pour le nier. Je suis certaine que la plupart des personnes en commentaires n'ont pas lu le livre, perso je suis en train de le lire et je peux vous dire que Caroline Fourest est une féministe qui défend les droits des femmes et les aide dans leur démarche à porter plainte.
Je suis sûr que la plupart des personnes en commentaire n'en ont pas fait autant pour la cause des femmes. Même petite, Caroline Fourest a écouté et aidé une de ses amies quand celle-ci a été agressée sexuellement par son père.
Mettre en doute sa loyauté envers cette cause est pour moi intolérable.
Vous devriez lire le bouquin avant de commenter..."
"Elle a raison, Madame Fourest. Peut-on prendre une seule de ses paroles pour dire qu'elle a tort ?
Par leurs excès parfois psychotiques, les ""Me Too"" sont du caca qui détruisent les rapports entre les êtres humains."
"Tellement d’accord avec Caroline Fourest : on est rendu dans une société qui juge avant le tribunal, qui jette en pâture des personnes avant que le jugement ne soit rendu, qui se sont retrouvés harcelés alors qu’ils étaient innocents.
Vraiment soulagé de la prise de conscience du phénomène metoo, que les victimes d’agressions sexuelles soient désormais écoutées dans les commissariats.
Le problème ce sont les prises d'opinions publiques sur l’émotionnel pour faire le buzz, les jugements hâtifs avant même le début de la moindre enquête ou que l’accusé n’ait pu donner sa propre version des faits.
Bref oui au féminisme, non au féminisme extrémiste fermé au moindre débat."
"Juste ta gueule Caroline, je crois que c'est la bonne expression, et faire de l'argent avec, je trouve ça pitoyable !"
Elle veut faire du buzz et de l’argent … l’inviter sur tous les plateaux participent à diffuser une parole nauséabonde qu’est la sienne dans tous les sujets qu’elle traite…
"Pour quelques uns accusés à tort, contre 94% de plaintes pour viol classées sans suite, je sais où est mon camp."
"Pourquoi tant de violence envers Caroline Fourest, c'est un point de vue intéressant qu'il faut avoir l'honnêteté d'écouter et essayer de comprendre avant de le démolir"
"Madame Caroline Fourest, vous êtes très courageuse, merci de prendre le parti de la nuance et de ce qui vous semble juste. C'est justement en denonçant les dérives du mouvement que vous renforcez son intégrité, sa crédibilité, son importance. Merci ❤"
"Beaucoup de sottises,  peu de rigueur intellectuelle,  un opportunisme éhonté  ,  pas mal de mensonges et d'approximations ,mais quand va - t - on cesser d'offrir des temps de plateau à  Caroline Fourest dès qu' elle nous fait un petit caca  nerveux afin qu'elle en fasse son beurre ?"
"Non. Non et non. Les présumées victimes, je refuse de les croire sur leur simple parole. 
J'ai le devoir de les écouter, voire de les aider à prouver, etc. 
Mais les croire a priori non.
Elles sont présumées victimes jusqu'au jugement coupable d'un présumé innocent. 
Si on sort de ça, on sort de l'état de droit."
Les commentaires négatifs face au simple appel à la nuance en dise long sur la société actuelle.
Elle zoom sur moins d'1% des cas et probablement moins pour en faire un bouquin. C'est très inquiétant. Elle fait son business sur des cas de niche.
"Entièrement d’accord avec Caroline Fourest!
C’est beau de voir une femme faire une « not all men » 😂
Sa réflexion a du fond. L’instrumentalisation parfois intégriste du mouvement « me too » pose question."
Caroline Fourest 😊👍
J'admire cette journaliste qui essai d'être objective.
Pour qu'il y ait abus de pouvoir il faudrait que le pouvoir soit de notre côté.
"Comment a t’elle pu oser dire cette phrase à Caroline Fourest ? Pour une avocate, on ne peut pas penser que ça lui à échapper comme ça oups pardon hein…"
"Je comprends tout à fait le malaise ressenti par Madame Fourest pour le vivre moi-même sur les forums de discussion. Dès que vous essayez de prendre un peu de recul par rapport à un sujet quelconque et d'y apporter de la nuance, dès que vous refusez de prime abord de hurler avec les loups en somme, on vous soupçonne de faire partie de l'autre camp. Vous vous faites accuser comme si réfléchir constituait un délit. Il semble difficile pour beaucoup de sortir de la vision simpliste et rassurante du camp du Bien contre le camp du Mal..."
Une avocate écoute avec inquiétude un discours qui rappelle à la prudence devant les accusations ! La justice est entre de bonnes mains.
"« Ce Que j’écoute doit être un je te crois à 99%» , oui donc ça vaut vachement le coup d’écrire un livre pour ces 1%… ah pardon t’as l’hypothèque de ta maison à racheter sur le dos des femmes qui se font agresser."
Pourquoi elle écrit un livre sur ce sujet ? On s'en fout. Ça fait avancer quelle cause ? Aucune. Caroline Fourest est hors sol.
"Je trouve les commentaires sur Caroline Fourest passablement delirants et donc inquietants...croyez vous vraiment que cela mette en danger le mouvement ""me too"" et pensez vous reellement que "" me too"" ne puisse pas etre interrogé ? Pourquoi ?"
Oui mais c était pas 1 pouce😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂EDF
Caroline Fourest est brillante et je salue son courage face aux contresens permanents de ce qu’elle dénonce. C’est une vérité de dire qu’il y a des hiérarchies dans les abus que subissent les femmes. Mettre de la nuance et de la précision apporte au contraire de la force au mouvement meetwo qui est le mouvement sociétal le plus important depuis…ouh…. Il n’y a jamais eu un mouvement de société aussi important. Je pense que les deux femmes sont d’accord mais l’avocate est partie bille en tête en faisant un faux procès à la grande féministe qu’est C. Fourest. C’est dommage.
"Caroline Fourest ne fait que nous prévenir et nous alerter sur les retour de bâton potentiel, comme elle l'a toujours fait . Et honnêtement je préfère que sa vienne d'une féministe que d'une personne qui est contre ce mouvement . Le point essentiel ce n'est pas de ne pas croire les victimes mais de réfléchir, pour les journaliste, à la médiatisation d'une affaire qui au font n'en n'est pas une, et ainsi les 1% vont décrédibiliser les 99% restant .
La preuve en est que nous pouvons avoir des débat entre Humaniste, et qu'il n'y a, pour le moment, pas de débat contre ce mouvement mais juste contre ces dérives potentiel"
"Bravo Madame Fourest, toujours dans la nuance et démasquant les revers de toute démggie."
Mais c'est vraiment si compliqué de comprendre ce que dit Caroline Fourest ?
Et ben tout ça parce qu'elle veut mettre un peu de nuances...ça en dit long sur la société actuelle...
"Les néo-féministes ne comprennent pas que le combat de Fourest est au contraire hyper utile pour le mouvement meetoo, car les anti meetoo se serviront toujours du moindre écart et de la moindre instrumentalisation du mouvement."
"Caroline Fourest a raison de questionner le mouvement ""me too"", ses possibles dérives et sa récupération à des fins parfois politiques/électoralistes. Quand on sacralise un sujet, il n'est plus permis de le questionner et c'est alors la fin de la démocratie. Merci à elle pour, une fois de plus, son courage et son audace."
"Ouaiiiisss, elle est contente Fourest, elle a réussi son business, et les médias qui l'ont tous reçus l'y ont bien aidée."
Madame l'avocate ce n'est pas parce que ca ne fait pas partie de votre quotidien que ca n'est pas une realite.
Caroline est nuancée et réaliste. L'avocate fait son beurre sur les outrance langagière. J espère que ses consultations sont gratuites et qu elle ne vide pas les poches des victimes pour plaider?
"Cette avocate est bornée. 
La démarche de Caroline Fourest est rationnelle et responsable."
"Il faudrait que cette avocate se renseigne davantage sur les fausses accusations (en justice ou par la voix médiatique) en France et ailleurs, il y en a un bon nombre disponible en quelques clics."
Je pense cette Caroline manque de talent et que ce une fabrication de Medias .mais cette avocate en face est encore plus Singler et givré.
"8:00 ""Les femmes ne mentent pas "" effrayant. Une illuminée."
Il y a  de vraies victimes et il y aussi un vertige Meeto Mytho.
"Elle raconte n'importe quoi sur Outreau, les victimes, encore aujourd'hui maintiennent leurs accusations"
"Il est inutile de discuter avec elle.Un peu comme avec les Cons.Incapable de changer d'avis,de remise en question,de méa Culpa."
Catherine Fourest contrairement au vin...vieillit mal !
Très courageuse Fourest de chercher la nuance sur un sujet aussi casse gueule !
"""les femmes ne mentent pas plus que quiconque"" ...et donc mentent autant que les hommes. Tout est dit ! Bravo Caroline Fourest d'avoir le courage de porter un discours de réflexion et de nuance, face au militantisme politique partisan, dont notre société a besoin ! 👌"
"J'ai pas tout suivi, mais être une ""avocate puissante"", ça me gêne... Un avocat n'est pas sensé être puissant !!"
Le feminisme a geométrie variable...
caroline fourest qui dénonce la pseudo victimisation des minorités et qui se victimise sans cesse
"Bravo Caroline, enfin un peu de raison"
"""Les femmes ne mentent pas"" ?? Ce serait pas un mensonge ça madame ? 😂"
Quel courage Caroline face a cette meute wokiste! Tout est dans la nuance.
mytho pas metoo la fourest
"Merci Madame Caroline Fourest pour vos propos et écrits , équilibrés ."
Bravo et merci à maître Bouillon
Catherine Fourest aurait pu se dispenser de cet ouvrage.
"Les réacs parlent toujours de présomption d'innocence (ce qui, dans le cas de viols, signifie ""présomption de mensonge"" de la part de la victime, soit dit en passant). Le souci de la justice, c'est ""surtout ne pas prendre le risque de condamner un innocent"". C'est très louable, personne ne songerait à critiquer cela. Mais on ne parle jamais du risque de ne pas condamner un coupable. Et donc, de condamner la victime à voir son agresseur impuni, et son statut de victime non reconnu. Jusqu'à la fin de ses jours."
"on dirait que tous ces gens n ont pas entendu parler de l affaire d outreau, et de ces vies gachées,car la parole des enfants etaient sacrée et le doute ne devait pas exister"
"Le rôle de l'avocat ce n'est de faire émerger la vérité. L'origine du terme est celui qui porte la voix.

Croire et douter c'est la seule posture intellectuelle qui permet de tendre vers la vérité."
Tout mon soutien à Mme Fourest. J'apprécie beaucoup son positionnement éclairé.
"Nombre des accusation à tort ? exemple de femme qui s'est enrichi  pour de fausse accusations ? 
cette femme a écrit ce bouquin pour vouloir se faire des copains agresseurs et leur donné des excuses à leur violence"
"Mais du coup, il sert à quoi son livre ?"
"Si des gens n'ont pas compris ce qu'elle a voulu dire , c'est que c'est mal exprimé voire mal écrit."
"Le ""Je te crois"" est une parole prononcée dans le domaine de la foi, du religieux. C'est la soumission à une parole divine qui ne peut souffrir, au risque d'être excommunié, d'une remise en cause, un questionnement, un débat contradictoire.  La formule est inappropriée dans une affaire où les féministes réclament justice. Puisque pour rendre la justice, il faut qu'il y ait un débat contradictoire qui amène la preuve mais aussi qui conteste les faits.  Et s'il est tellement difficile d'aborder la justice avec des affaires d'agressions sexuelles, toutes les parties, en ce y compris les avocats, doivent se questionner sur le rôle systémique qu'ils tiennent dans cette institution."
"Quel courage Mme Fourest ! Cette avocate exaspérée qui n'a rien de la tempérance des grandes intellectuelles est un bel exemple de ce que cette nouvelle page de l'histoire de la pensée féministe est : une dérive sécuritaire et identitaire. Metoo a fait basculer le féminisme dans les pensées politiques de droite, voire de droite dure, en se concentrant sur des thématiques sécuritaires. Metoo est à gerber"

Do such report in Bolywood also. You will find 10x more issues.
Its a routine in India
Mam this has become common in every wood...you must fight it out 💪
What about media industry?
Nothing will change...
What about the bhojpuri industry?
"Palki, the rot extends to Music organizers in Mumbai and abroad also."
"Nothing will ever change!!
Just people names will be thrown for sometime and then same people will be holding more powerful positions."
It’s an industry where it’s very difficult to stop such things because few are ready to do anything and few are trying to do the right way and with talent. On top of that nepotism. All new comers have to make a position for themselves and even established ones need to retain their positions.
"Atleast the WCC forced the  Malayalam film industry to open the Pandora box. In other film industries in India, eg. Bollywood,Tamil,Telugu,Kannada,
Bangla, Bojpuri, film industries the Pandora box is still hidden somewhere and first of all they have to find it out! 😅"
❤😮❤ my palki
"Dont compare with Bollywood.in Bollywood it was someday someone called the media and raised allegations. It was just a baseless move from Bollywood. In Mollywood, women have formed a committee first and studied very well the issues and gone to the media. Its not the same.. They cant be like a Mollywood women."
"Bollywood or Nollywood their stories of mivies must be shown to the home ministry/ cultural division prior to eorking on the movies. People pay money mam, THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BE INSPIRED. Hope country thinks its fair ?."
"she always talk allegations about china , their growth is unpredictable than our india . Learn from them bring good things to india . No development always blame and  going behind of them . Study the competitor strength than focusing weakens"
Like Bollywood is good. Everyone like to talk about others not their own backyard
"It happens every where and if you start digging Bollywood, you would talk for years."
In a country where 70 percent abuse cases are false it's difficult to determine who is telling truth and who is lieing
Well .nobody generally calls it mollywood😂
Sick
Its a bunch of lies for media attention. 😂
🙂😂incredible India... let's see some other news.. many other better things to watch and pass time.
D’accord ok et du coup on fais quoi ?

9:35 Starts talking about Diddy.
Fascinating
Hip-hop and me too are oxymorons as hip-hop at its core is misogynistic amongst other things.
😂🎉 GO PUFFY! GO PUFFY!
"Sam , Super Babe"
Diddy is a monster!
Now they all talkin N 2025🤦🏾‍♂️ smh. They better hope he found guilty. He been doing this stuff since the 90s.
FreeDiddy ❤❤❤❤❤
So we are going to completely skip Heavy Metal's and Hard Rock's turn again?
Free diddy kong ✊️
"Diddy isn't, and never was hiphop"
People obsessing about the fact Diddy had sex with men kinda makes me think about how people treat rape in prison. They offer it up as another form of punishment because as men we often feel that it wont happen to us. Rape is often about power and there are some twisted men out there that are not gay but are hell bent on expressing their power over you.
"Thank goodness for voices like Taylor, Caroline, and Kat on these matters. Truly appreciate the work all three of these women do!"
"Babe, wake up, Taylor is horrifying us with education again."
"15 years ago when I was a freshman in high school, Ia remember seeing writing on our bathroom walls about Chris Brown and how “he can beat me any time” and how Rihanna “deserved” it. I cant believe we’re going back to that"
"People are highly motivated not to understand coercive control as a dynamic, because recognizing it fundamentally upends the way that our society has viewed certain sets, the nature of crime, victimization, and power... And would force us to reckon with how much our lives are full of coersion."
The Taylor Lorenz/Kat Tenbarge/Matt Bernstein cinematic universe is my jam.
"thank you for mentioning Chris Brown. the support this man gets is disgusting and I will never understand it. as she said in the video he is a known abuser, why are people still supporting him? this accepted mistreatment toward women is disgusting and i'm not here for it at all."
lol this panel is a misogynist’s nightmare i love all three of you. thank you taylor 🙏🏼
My ex husband used coercive control on me for 15 years. No one suspected a thing. He turned everyone against me when I left. I'm glad to have survived. I almost didn't survive. My love goes out to everyone who has been subjected to any type of abuse. Mutual abuse is not a thing and reactive abuse is also not a thing - that's victim blaming with extra steps
"I'll never forget the first time that I listened to a lecture on sex trafficking. The presenter said ""Many people who are trafficked go home and sleep in their own bed that night."" People just fundamentally don't understand it, somewhat because they hate women, but also because they just LITERALLY don't get it."
"I'm old enough now to see this 15 year cycle with celebrity women where they go from the young, hot icon to making progressively more explicit art/media to unpopular, to smeared, to clearly having unhealthy coping mechanisms like drugs and having very public mental breakdowns, and later learning which powerful man was abusing them the most when it's way too late to do anything about it."
dreading the impact of the trial's outcome and what it may lead to for future SA and DV cases
"The 2018 Grammys pretending to care about the me too movement, then giving Ed Sheeran’s shape of you the Grammy” for best pop vocals” over Kesha’s praying, then making her perform the song live after losing is when I knew the movement was a joke. I’ll always be thankful for Rose McGowan, Kesha, Cassie, and the many others for their bravery, but I will never forgive the industry that did this to them then pretended to care."
Caroline! Yay! So happy to see Caroline here and hear her thoughts on this 😊
"While I don't like Blake Lively, I can admit Baldoni did start a smear campaign against her to bury the allegations. My bias against her made it easier for me to believe Baldoni but once I actually looked at the evidence, like the messages between the two, I changed my mind."
"The Heard Depp trial was one of the worst things to happen to women outside of the repealing of Roe v Wade.
As a survivor it was absolutely traumatic to hear other women talking about Heard and victim blaming."
"YES! Completely agree on the pop culture affects politics, I hate that we're dismissed for talking about this stuff as it's ""women's issues"" as if we're a Completely separate, annoying issue which deserves to be sidelined. The way so many women I've interacted with who have horrible internalized misogyny because of women like Candace Owens is honestly shocking"
I can’t say what a relief it has been to find your channel and hear you talking about these topics. It’s so frustrating to see even people educated in DV who don’t see the parallels between all of these cases.
"13:00 I appreciate you journalists sharing information about domestic abuse because it does help audiences with understanding cases of abuse in their own lives. I remember that growing up, the police frequently showed up at my home due to domestic abuse/IPV against my mother by my father. She was a 5’ 4” chronically ill stay-at-home mother with a history of mental illness and he was a 6’ 4” truck driver with regressive views on many things including gender roles. Once when things got heated between them both and my mom returned aggression with aggression, she got overwhelmed and called the police and since neither party acted with perfect innocence, my mother ended up spending the night in jail. After my mother died, my father went on to abuse both me and my sister and his next wife blamed the problems in their marriage on us. This is how abusers evade the consequences for their actions over and over and over again. Please keep up what you do. You all speak truth to power."
As a teacher I’ve had to stop using Kahoot/Quizlet and use random names on Blooket instead because reliably there will be at least one student every time who will call themself Diddy
I feel like this country has moved so far right since 2021 that things that were unthinkable in 2017 or 2020 is now happening pretty commonly.
Such a harrowing subject but great collaboration! I love Caroline and she is so intelligent and entertaining
It's such a relief to know that people like yall exist and are actively having these conversations on a public stage.
"The Racketeering may have been a stretch, but the trafficking was pretty slam dunk.  I can't understand how the jury acquitted him of trafficking."
Celebrity trials have always been political. Fame gives wealth and power. The law protects power.
"17:58. What's not to understand?  I grew up watching Johnny Depp and loved his movies, but even I was like ""what an a$$hole"".  No normal nonabusive man jokes about putting his girlfriend in the trunk on his car.  She didn't even say his name when venting about abuse. He went after her financially and ruined her career because she mentioned ""someone"" abused her. WTF

I don't know enough about the evidence of Lively / Baldoni . . .I do acknowledge men get the benefit of the doubt and women get hated more.  But I don't think she deserves hatred in the meantime . . .while evidence and witnesses are spoken about

Also, Woody Allen got away with calling Mia Farrow ""crazy"" for trying to protect her daughter . . .even though HE married her other daughter whom he also abused.  Just sick"
"In regard to Depp V Heard, I remember Johnny Depp’s supporters would ridicule Amber Heard. Some of the things they ridiculed her for is: 

•Being a single mother
•Being homeless and relying on Johnny Depp for a place to stay after the divorce 
•Sleeping with someone after their breakup 
•Making an SA accusation 
•Defending herself

When I look at that list I personally see a vulnerable woman. When someone else looks at that list they see damaged goods. 

There was no empathy extended to her. People pick apart the right and how to de-radicalise them but here it seems the issue wasn’t the information they had but how they processed that information. 

What we really need to start asking ourselves is how do we encourage empathy when there is none?"
Thank you for speaking up about this. this topic is too triggering for me to engage with rn but i really appreciate the work you & others put in to un-silence the voices of victims and survivors!
"Unfortunately, I was one of the people who was swayed by ""mutual abuse"" discourse when Depp v Heard was on going. My whole tiktok algorithm was belittling/making fun of Heard and supporting Depp when the trial first started and I feed into the algorithm. After the whole trail I watched Kat and Matt's video and one more content creator's video about Amber Heard tittled how she was the victim. Those two videos made me realize I was an idiot and I am 100% susceptible to propoganda. I will forever carry the shame of participating in that misogyn slop in me but I am happy to announce that I learned from my mistake and you guy's video and now when it comes to women who suddenly get all these hate (Cassie, Blake Lively, Rachel Zegler, Megan Markel, Megan thee Stalion) I take a step back to see what is the source for this sudden surge of hate is and I am always suspicious of the presented reasons for the hate campaigns."
"I would argue it isn't just sexual violence that has been normalized, but all forms of social violence have been normalized."
"If Diddy weren't a celebrity, the public wouldn't have the same reaction, nor would Diddy receive the same sentence. The fact that so many people can use fame as a shield to avoid accountability and consequence is appalling."
"Thank you! Excellent conversation as usual. You and your guests always put into words the stuff I notice and ""feel"" but just can't articulate. I enjoy circling back with friends on these topics and being able to explain better my views and reactions to news cycles and ""the monetization of misogyny"" (thanks for that one)."
"It completely infuriates me how people never believe women. They didn't believe my mother, they didn't believe me, they didn't believe my sister, they didn't believe my friend. Even when there is evidence upon evidence, people will bend over backwards to defend a male abuser"
"What's funny to me is there is sooo much drama in the muscle guys community it's insane, male creators whose main content is the drama itself xD but if a woman did that it would'nt be seen the same"
Oh hi Caroline Kwan! Glad to see these minds weighing in together 💜 thank you all
"Thank you ladies for a great discussion. 
I was a misogynist woman until my early thirties when I went back to school. A class in women’s studies was the beginning of my intellectual change. Learning to love myself as a female was another imperative beginning to break out of woman hating. I was a misogynist for many of the reasons you stated. I wanted to be on the “winning” team because it was clear women were the losers in patriarchy. I didn’t even know what patriarchy was. I had to read When God was a Woman to get it. 

Misogyny was fed to me through entertainment like I Love Lucy. By the time I was in my early twenties I had seen so much disparagement of women through media, our bodies as smelly, our emotions were infantile, our thinking was trivial, our conversations were vapid and unimportant…all of that I took in on a subconscious level and then complimented myself of how I wasn’t like “them” trying to gain favor in the eyes of men by shitting on women. I attempted to raise myself in the hierarchy like crabs in a barrel. What is CRAZY is that I had been sexually abused and assaulted since childhood through my young adult years BY MEN WHO HATED WOMEN!! I must have had some variant of Stockholm syndrome to not be able to tie it together as a result of misogyny and patriarchy. Because it was and is  invisibly entangled into culture. We swim in it every day. 
There has to be such a complete revamp in order to change the tide BUT capitalism favors men, is geared towards males whether it’s a product sold to women or sold to men, it’s still about what will be pleasing to men! They are the CEOs, the execs, the decision makers and the consumers with greater spending power. 
I think the solution is women who wake up to the cultural misogyny need to stop having sex with misogynists, whether they are women or men. Animals isolate other animals that are antisocial. Why not try what works in the animal kingdom."
"Thank you for weaving Sabrina into this, I feel like I'm going crazy seeing everyone hate on her for ""feminist"" reasons"
"I've started to notice when these hate campaigns start how confusing they feel. 

With Blake Lively, I was shocked that someone cared about the press of the movie. I grew up with a tv channel called Lifetime, and it was wall to wall mellow dramatic domestic violence stories. On top of that, the way murder cases involving women are talked about, you would think there was no domestic violence or sexism involved. A man killed his wife for money, or he wanted a divorce. Before that, they had the perfect life. Holding Blake Lively ro a higher standard is just bizarre. She was even held to a higher standard than the woman who wrote the book."
and the tech industry using algos to amplify these dynamics and monetise them. These digital platforms need proper and evolving regulation.
Shout out to Medusone for making videos regarding the DISGUSTING way Depp v Heard was covered by nearly everyone
Caroline Kwan letsgooooo!
"I think of my mom who I talked to before she died about why she was so critical of her daughters, herself, and other women around her, especially when it came to “respectability“. She felt immense guilt about it at the end of her life, and had realized that it was her own way to try to keep her daughters safe and protected. If she and all of women could just fit in enough then they would be safe from being ostracized and isolated, which makes any woman more vulnerable. Ultimately though it’s just a fantasy, and you never have true freedom if you require permission and approval from people who are bigoted or biased against you."
Does the general public even have a clear understanding of what sex trafficking is? I remember watching a YouTuber talking about how she almost got sex trafficked and I was horrified because it initially sounded so mundane
The Amber Heard case was definitely a cultural tipping point. In my own life I also had both men and women disagreeing with me vehemently when I would try and talk about the weird mysogny that was taking place in the media. It felt like people were being brain washed into their opinions.
"Absolute BANGER of an episode. You're killing it, Taylor."
"THANK YOU for touching on the sabrina carpenter thing. as a woman i feel like the message the internet is telling me with this whole thing (and it's not just this, it reflects a broader cultural shift towards swerfiness and pseudofeminism) that if i choose to express my sexuality publicly, i will be criticized not only by the puritanical right for being too slutty but also be accused by a large portion of the left of being anti-feminist. THAT is setting women back, not her album cover."
"Great conversation! Also, correcting yourself publicly is so important and laudable, especially when misinformation is so rife on the Internet these days."
3 queens discussing the fall of civilization
"Men are almost infantilized in abusive situations. Like Depp was a poor little guy, he's just quirky and he's went through all this stuff, and Amber was so lucky to have the opportunity to take care of him.  If she hadn't been so mean he would have been her little puppy, and all those women just know they personally would have done it right and the opportunity was wasted on Amber."
"I'm not US based so the discourse and facts arround the case are perhaps not as clear to me, but when it comes to the sex trafficing charges: didn't Diddy basically deploy a variant of a loverboy approach? How known are lovereboy tactics in the US? In my country there was nation wide education programms starting ~10 years ago bc of increased frequency of cases and people now recognize that you can be trafficed by your romantic partner."
"12:55 Attorney here: the “reasonable doubt” thing doesn’t come from a belief that both sides are bad. It’s a fundamental piece of our legal system, that is intended to protect the accused. If the prosecution can’t prove that the crimes charged were committed “beyond a reasonable doubt”, the jurors are instructed that they cannot find him guilty if they still have doubts, based on the facts and testimony that were presented at trial. I do acknowledge that a direct result of that legal doctrine is that the public viewpoint then switches to “both sides are bad” “Cassie isn’t credible or she abused him too” but that’s people letting their assumptions run wild, and ignoring or being unaware of the research-backed understanding we have today of abuse and control dynamics. It’s NOT the law saying that she’s also responsible or an abuser. Important distinction."
"I was wrong about Depp v. Heard for about a year, and that is something I will freely admit. As a survivor myself I am ashamed that I fell for the PR narrative. But the desire to do right by my fellow survivors outweighs that shame. It sucks others can’t do that. It definitely made me way more critical of the sensationalism around trials, especially celebrity trials.

Thanks for the video Taylor, Kat, and Caroline! Great and thoughtful as always ❤"
"Some good news from all this: I, and MANY women like me, saw how much the internet was fueling the cultural shift these days, and how much the internet was run by men, and decided to enter the fray and be heard. For myself, I decided to troll the trolls; I made this account, I anonymized it (that's right, COME FOR ME bros, you'll never figure out who I am) and I devote a lot of my online energy towards relentlessly making gamer dudes who go after women's days just a little bit worse. It makes me feel powerful, and reminds me that the internet is the ultimate equalizer, it does not mater on here if you are big, or rich, or white, or male, the best comments win 🙂 To anyone who feels like you are losing hope; you can do something, your voice matters, and there's more women than men on this Earth, if we ALL speak up.....we got this!"
"Thank you so much for covering this. I love your work and your medium;  you cover such important topics, write excellent scripts, and have engaging guests on, and make everything digestible to the common person. ❤"
Social media == personalized tabloids
"So on the T.D. Jakes portion, this is an example of lazy research. T.D. Jakes is not a ""random preacher"" and the connections between Diddy and Jakes is deeper than just SEO connections. Jakes was one of Diddy's spiritual mentors and Diddy has publicly associated with and thanked Jakes. That is not to say that Jakes did anything nefarious but it is to say that there is more to the story and that is what fueled the more extensive algorithmic manipulation and public interest."
"How likeable someone is plays a huge factor in how much they are believed. Depp is seen as far more likeable than Heard. Cassie is more likeable (or at least sympathetic) than Heard and Lively. Diddy has been disliked by many for years, including a strong suspicion that he had something to do with prominent deaths. It's insane to me that we had video evidence of extreme abuse in the Diddy case and people insist it was a consensual sexual relationship. Yuck!"
"Thank you all for the work you do, it means so much to our collective understanding (and our mental health!) 💖"
"Content creators are establishing a troubling precedent, acting as willing tools in smear operations"
"The trial verdict was a slap in the face to SA victims and horrific upholding of rpe culture.

As with Obama becoming president and the Black Lives Matter protests, there was such visible progress being made with MeToo a lot of regressive people and hateful bigots got so freaked out at any sign of change they dug their heels into harmful existing power structures even more."
"I'm always torn between ""this is a matter of power structures and education around abuse"" and ""it's grotesque and inappropriate that so many people are obsessed with the abuse these victims went through."" I don't engage with any of it if I can help it, because it feels like the reasons people are obsessed with it are very much the wrong reasons."
"I’m not sure what’s meant by leftists in this context. But as a socialist / communist; I clearly understand why these cases matter, despite wanting to eliminate the entire concept of celebrities from humanity if I could. I definitely wouldn’t follow them beyond a show like this because the gossip / drama YouTube accounts don’t appeal to me. But that’s why journalists like Taylor and guests who do bring these cases to the attention of a different audience are so important.

It would definitely be ridiculous for people to suggest that it’s irrelevant and just a story for women. Or it’s beneath them because it’s gossip. Or whatever the reason given."
This is exactly why we still need Me Too as a society and it's on us men to keep amplifying it.
"I never actually thought to look into the details of the Heard/Depp case, I just assumed that it was a case of a man not being taken seriously for being the victim of abuse. Thank you for raising awareness! Empathy is being able to value and understand the experience of someone else, even when it doesn't align with your own experiences, and empathy is required to make a positive impact on the world."
"29:03 STILL HAVEN'T FORGIVEN YOU ABOUT AMBER, HASAN."
"As I kid I was a 2Pac fan and I remember hating Puffy back then. As that beef went away, I no longer hated these people and even disliked hip-hop beef culture. But I found out just how much of a monster he was, I wish I hated him more back then. It's just proof that hip hop or rock and roll, Hollywood or DC, rich and famous men in power turn into monsters."
"My husband was all over the Depp trial but, when it came to Diddy he just said ""yeah, I can't watch that..."". For him the Depp trial was entertaining. It was something to grab your popcorn and Michael Jackson meme over. The Diddy trial though, that was too real for him. It wasn't entertaining - it was disturbing."
"Some of the same reasons people kick down at the poor. They are weaker, have fewer resources, and have fewer strong friends who would come to their aid."
"It's so distressing how so many people just don't care about sexual violence. I never, ever want to hear about how ""everyone believes victims"" again"
I do agree being called Perez Hilton is the ultimate insult
"Please could yall do an analysis on Pharrell, he legit intertwines with all the controversies and I haven’t heard anybody talk about him. He has worked many times with Diddy as a song called Diddy, he’s good friends with Gwen Stefani, he jump started Justin Timberlake career. Raised 60 million dollars for Israel. Has two legal disputes over Chad and Kelis music. Has a song called blurred lines which is about not asking for consent. And he put rose parks face onto a k pop stars underwear for the met gala. Like he’s just getting more success and praise, it’s just so strange nobody’s talking about it."
Amazing collab. 3 of my favorite commentators ❤
I love public drama. But like... The low key kind where two KnitTok creators are beefing over accusations of pattern theft
"Really interesting conversation, thank you all for talking about this and speaking out against misogyny"
"27:56 Go Kat Go! 

Love the purple headphones and the best argument/rant ever."
I've just never understood the mindset of believing someone would go out of their way to falsely accuse someone of such a crime when the odds are so stacked against them. What is the perceived benefit in doing that? Riling up right wing support for the accused who then viciously attack the claimant? People honestly don't think deep enough about the the follow through in these kinds of beliefs
so so SO grateful to find out that there are women in the creatorsphere that believe amber heard!!
Also Taylor lol Caroline wasn’t talking about Megan Markel when she said Meg. She was talking about Megan Thee Stallion….
"Just speaking from personal experience with past abusive relationships... As a victim, what can end up happening is you are basically cornered and trapped by extremes. There were times where from the outside I looked like the most toxic abusive person in that relationship. But the details of that relationship pushed me to more and more extreme behaviors because I was so consistently unsafe, violated, not respected, boundaries were not a thing. It took me a long time to grapple with that fact because the person I was in that relationship is the opposite of what I want to be or have strived to be. 

There is also a perpetuation in the mental health sciences that blame victims... It's less obvious now but there is a deeply rooted mysoginistic factor to the DSM. Borderline Personality Disorder (PBD) is an extremely common diagnosis for victims who have endured abuse. It is especially true for those with CPTSD. The diagnosis makes it about that individuals behavior when the issue is the trauma and how that affects their behavior. This whole ""well they are both toxic""... That behavior I described of being explosive and looking from the outside like the abuser, this is very commonly diagnosed as BPD. It's a behavior that manifest as a result of abusive situations and extremely high control situations. The majority of time when people seek help, it is the victim, because abusers do not see themselves have being the issue. 

So yeah I find it sick that this is the narrative. It's one of the reasons I never pursued criminal charges, among the other factors like people not believing victims, and justice largely not being carried out in these situations. This is just another example of this. And fun fact, so is the Epstein scandal. Why aren't the victims being interviewed and believed? Why are the perpetrators getting off on charges, having their names redacted in files etc. It's sick."
Appreciate your videos so much Taylor!❤
"This was enlightening.. I was one of the people who was not at all interested in any of these trials because ""there's more important stuff going on."" 
Thank you for another banger of an episode"
Big fan of Caroline
"I think its important to defend women speaking out about abuse regardless of whether they're right wing and also question whether people are normalizing/enabling/commiting violence against women regardless of whether they're right or left wing (insert wtv idealogy here). I think a lot of women on the left have a blind spot for left wing men who fit the mold of what they ""want"" a man to be but the dude does the same shit as conservatives at the club house/country club/yacht party with no cameras/concerned parties. People are just ignoring how close the clintons/other career democrats/conservatives were to epstein because they want to pretend like its just the conservative maga cult elites. Same story with diddy just through a different lense."
Great video. Still reeling from the surprise Brace Belden appearance and now u give us Caroline 😍
really enjoying what you have been doing on here lately
Another great episode. Thank you
"I love Laura Richards, she's a true hero. Great video."
this was such a great video. great work taylor

CAROLINE MY QUEEN
Amazing episode. Bring them back
"I’ve been watching a lot of Twitch recently. Mostly female Korean streamers who travel around or play music or things like that. And also people like Hasan. It can be fun, but there’s always a feeling of it being incredibly right wing, incredibly idiotic, and bigoted. Whether it be in a sort of jokey way or seriously. When you try and talk politics on a channel that’s not specifically political, you can get warned or timed out if you’re on the left, but the right generally can say whatever they like. And the way the chat moves so fast makes it almost impossible to make a serious point anyway. I can imagine there are a lot of closeted people on there. Particularly women who have the most to lose by coming out. In terms of both crucial financial support as well as potential abusive language or worse that could result from being open and honest. I have to say that the world would probably be a better place if Twitch didn’t exist. Live-streaming can be great, but I don’t think Twitch can really be reformed, and I don’t think we’d be missing any secret sauce that couldn’t be replicated. I think Kick has shown how easy it is to copy the Twitch model. And that platform is even more toxic. I think we need something entirely new with a socialist mindset in order to make it a healthy pastime."
It's encouraging to see you all doing this work! Thank you!

Neutral wäre ""Warum gehen sie juristisch gegen die Vorwürfe vor?""

Wobei sich die Frage dann selbst beantwortet"
"Irgendwann kippt der Beitrag ins Schäbige. Man zählt darauf, dass immer etwas hängen bleibt."
Ich sehe einen zerstörten Menschen.
"Den RBB „Qualitätsmedium“ zu nennen, ist (nicht nur in diesem direkten Zusammenhang) schon mutig….."
"12:42 „Wir haben Fehler gemacht“, aber in Einzelheiten will man sich nicht ergehen. Alles bleibt, wie es war."
"Ich denke nicht, dass alle verloren haben, zumindest Gelbhaars Nachrücker nicht. Ich denke auch nicht, dass die Hürde nun unermesslich hoch ist sondern in eine richtigere Relation geschoben wird: Wenn keine sexuelle Belästigung nach StGB vorliegt, liegt keine vor. Das sollte man bei jeder metoo-Debatte (die sicherlich ihre Berechtigungen haben können), bedenken."
Es habe nicht alle Beteiligten verloren. Manche Leute haben davon profitiert. Dem wird nicht nachgegangen.
Wie Demmert zu ihren Posten beim RBB gekommen ist auch fragwürdig!!
"Er hatte ja zu mehreren Vorwürfen Alibis präsentiert. Nicht nur eine Anschuldigung also falsch. 
Wer hat die Intrige denn koordiniert? Falsche Beschuldigung muss hart bestraft werden und Schadenersatz und Verdienstausfall fällig werden.

Was wirft man nun vor? Flirt unter Kollegen und Berührung am Rücken?"
Es haben nicht alle Verloren... Audretsch hat sein Mandat... Beim RBB hat keiner seinen Job verloren... Alle bekommen ihre hohen Gehälter weiter (da stellt sich wieder die Frage warum die ÖR so hohe Gehälter zahlen wenn nie jemand Verantwortung für irgendwas tragen muss) Der RBB bekommt weiter seine Rundfunkbeiträge auch wenn er seinen Auftrag nicht erfüllt hat... Nur Gelbhaar muss die Konsequenzen tragen.
"Wer profitiert?

Nachrückerin Julia Schneider und Stefan Audretsch. 
Zu deren Rolle in der Gelbhaar Affäre wäre ein Teil 2 sicher sehr interessant um den Vorgang in den Einzelheiten näher aufzuarbeiten."
"19:07 ""Härte"" ist relativ. Ich finde die Wortwahl ungünstig, da man der Autorin unterstellen könnte, sie wolle Herrn Gelbhaar als skrupellosen, kalten Taktierer darstellen. Als Beschuldigter nutzt man halt alle juristischen Mittel, um sich zu wehren. Ob man dies dann ""hart"" findet, ist schlichtweg subjektiv."
"Die letzten drei Sekunden zerstören den guten und ausgewogenen Bericht. ""Bei dem Fall haben alle Beteiligten verloren"". Nein, es haben nicht alle verloren. Das Mandat von Stefan Gelbhaar hat jetzt jemand Anderes eingenommen. Dieser Aspekt wurde überhaupt nicht beleuchtet."
"Interessante Reportage, die u.a. zeigt, wie durch die Auswahl von Interview-Teilen, das teilweise nachträgliche Kommentieren von Aussagen usw. auf eine subtile Weise ein Eindruck hinterlassen wird, dass Hr. Gelbhaar ""im Grunde"" doch nicht unschuldig sei.
Interessant auch, dass sich in dieser Reportage wenig konkrete Belastungs-Indizien finden lassen. Soweit ich es entnehmen konnte, geht es um Berührungen an Arm und Schulter und nächtliche Nachrichten (mit welchem Inhalt?).
Besonders schwierig ist für mich nachvollziehbar, wenn ein entscheidendes Kriterium ist, wie jemand etwas empfindet. Und das verbunden mit der Erwartung, dass der andere diese Empfindung spüren muss und sich entsprechend vorausschauend zu verhalten hat.
Wohlgemerkt, ich kenne die Details im Verhalten von Hr. Gelbhaar nicht, kenne auch die entsprechenden gerichtlichen Beweisaufnahmen, Entscheidungen etc. nicht. Aber diese Dokumentation beleuchtet das in meinen Augen auch nicht klar. Deshalb sollten auch eine unterschwellig eingebaute Wortwahl oder gar ein Säen von Zweifel unterbleiben.
Als Fazit bleibt für mich: In einem solchen Umfeld sollte man den Umgang nur auf das Nötigste beschränken, keinerlei auch nur ansatzweise vertrauliche Verhaltensweisen anwenden etc. Dass unangemessenes Verhalten oder gar strafrechtlich relevante Verstöße völlig unakzeptabel sind, und geahndet werden sollten, versteht sich von selbst."
" Mir tut der Herr Gelbhaar leid: Erst kostet ihn die vermutlich ideologiegesteuerte ÖRR-Berichterstattung seine Karriere, dann setzt der nächste ÖRR-Sender noch einen drauf, indem er fragt, ob er nicht doch ein schlimmer Finger sei, da er doch eine Frau am Arm berührt haben soll! Mo bleibt der Maßstab, wo die Ernsthaftigkeit?"
Gelbhaar hat meine volle Solidarität
"Die vorwürfe die noch im Raum stehen hören sich lächerlich an, wenn man den Vergleich zu anderen MeToo Opfern zieht. Berührungen an Arm und Schulter sowie „nächtliche“ Chats sind kein Grund eine politische Karriere zu zerstören, egal ob sie stimmen oder nicht."
"Das Postulat, dass die Unschuldsvermutung in solchen Fällen nicht gelten soll, wird hier letztlich bekräftigt. Es widerspricht aber den Grundfesten des Rechts."
"Es ist erschütternd, wie in dieser Doku die nachweislich falsche eidesstattliche Erklärung – die von einer nicht existierenden Person stammt – zwar erwähnt, aber dann fast beiläufig abgehandelt wird. Das war der schwerste Vorwurf, der sich als komplett haltlos herausgestellt hat. Statt diese offensichtliche Intrige weiter aufzuklären – inklusive der Frage, wer davon profitiert hat – richtet sich der Fokus plötzlich wieder auf andere, gleichzeitig eingegangene Vorwürfe, als könnten diese völlig unabhängig davon doch irgendwie glaubwürdig sein. Dass Gelbhaar sich juristisch gegen diese koordinierte Kampagne gewehrt hat, wird ihm nun auch noch als überzogene Reaktion ausgelegt. Diese Umkehr der Perspektive – weg vom eigentlichen Skandal hin zu einer impliziten Täter-Opfer-Umkehr – ist journalistisch fragwürdig und inhaltlich absurd."
"Wenn alles ""Gefühl"" ist, dann gibt es auch keine Rechtssicherheit und damit auch keinen Schutz des Individuums mehr ... Nur weil jemand das Wort ""übergriffig"" in den Mund nimmt, darf noch keinerlei Rufschädigung ins Werk gesetzt werden ..."
"Der größte Witz.  Für 60.000 Euro Zwangsgebühren wurden externe Berater beauftragt,  die den Profis vom rbb die Mängel in ihren Geschäfzsprozessen aufschreiben sollen."
"Warum wird hier verschwiegen, wer vom ""Abschuss"" Gelbhaar profitiert hat?"
"Und hier stelle ich einmal fest: zu behaupten man wurde sexuell belästigt oder misshandelt, wenn es nicht stimmt, ist genau so schlimm als hätte man so etwas getan!"
"Stefan Gelbhaar hätte sich nicht zurückziehen sollen, weil er doch genau wusste, dass nichts an den Vorwürfen dran war. Letztendlich ging es nach meiner Wahrnehmung nur darum, ihn aus dem Weg zu schaffen, damit die Nachrücker profitieren. Das hat ja geklappt."
"Wow - der einzige ""Beleg"", den die Autorin gegen S. Gelbhaar konrekt anspricht, ist eine Dame, der gerichtlich verboten wurde, wahrheitswidrige Beschuldigungen gegen S.Gelbhaar weiter zu verbreiten.

Was für eine Rechercheleistung!"
Ihr habt alle mitgehetzt🤮🤮🤮
Wann kommt der 2.Teil zu Strippenziehern und Nutznießern der Intrige?
"Zu 19:36
Warum kann die Zapp-Journalistin die Frage, wann der Fall für sie geklärt ist, nicht konkret beantworten? ""Wenn man verstanden hat, was vorgefallen ist"" ist unkonkret und nebulös. Wer ist ""man"" in diesem Fall, wessen Verständnis soll hier ausschlaggebend sein?

Bislang ist in der Sache nur im vorläugigen Rechtsschutz entschieden worden. Eine konkrete Antwort wäre zum Beispiel gewesen, dass die Sache nach einer Hauptsache-Entscheidung als geklärt zu betrachten ist. Darauf will sich die Journalistin aber anscheinend nicht festlegen. Warum nicht?

Durch die unkonkrete Beantwortung der Frage entsteht der Eindruck, dass hier ein sog. ""goalpost moving"" vorbereitet werden soll. In dem man sich nicht auf konkrete Kriterien festlegt, kann man sich immer neue Vorraussetzungen ausdenken, die erfüllt sein müssen, damit die Sache als geklärt betrachtet werden kann. Das ist eine offensichtlich unfaire Strategie, welche mit Qualitätsjournalismus nichts zu tun hat."
"das Erbauliche daran ist, wie der Beitrag auch inhaltlich und formell bestätigt, dass Schuld eine Frage des Charakters und nicht des Geschlechts ist. Besonders tragisch dabei, dass dieser Grundsatz in Verbindung mit einer Partei, offenbar missachtet wurde, die sich eigentlich gegen JEDE Form der Diskriminierung aufgrund von Herkunft und Geschlecht einsetzt."
Schwierig wenn alles so schwammig gehalten wird. Es wird nicht einmal irgendwas konkretes genannt & immer nur drumherumgeredet.
Audretsch wollte seinen Konkurrenten los werden für den Bundestagsplatz.
Ist ja der RBB fein raus. Mach den laden endlich dicht.
"Dass es unter Metoo häufig zu Kollateralschäden kam wo jemandes leben zerstört wurde, der unschuldig war, ist vielen egal."
Solche Journalisten müssen sofort entlassen werden
"Als ob man Fröschen den Auftrag geben würde, eine Studie zur Trockenlegung des Tümpels zu erstellen.........."
"Gab es wenigstens eine strafrechtliche Verfolgung der ersten Dame, die alles erfunden hatte? Irgendwie werden solche unwichtigen Details immer bei diesen Berichten vergessen."
"Ich liebe Zapp. Ihr habt unglaublich differenzierte Berichte, die sonst nur schwer zu finden sind. Die Fragen der Reporter:innen sind super, und sie machen immer einen tollen Job.

Hier hat mich aber gestört, dass die Spiegel-Reporterin als „Expertin“ befragt wurde. Nur weil man über ein Thema schreibt, ist man nicht automatisch eine Expertin. Gerade bei so polarisierenden Themen braucht es mehr als nur viel Wissen, um als Expertin zu gelten. Meines Erachtens ist die Reporterin voreingenommen; „Expertin“ suggeriert (zumindest für mich), dass sie so neutral wie möglich ist.

Außerdem stört mich, dass nach dem Einspielen des Lage-der-Nation-Podcasts suggeriert wird, dies sei Teil jener Berichterstattung, die Gelbhaar ausschließlich als Opfer sieht. Dabei wurde im Podcast durchaus angesprochen, dass weiterhin Vorwürfe im Raum stehen. Faktisch gibt es erfundene Vorwürfe – und unabhängig von der Causa Gelbhaar stellt sich abstrakt die Frage, inwiefern MeToo nicht nur juristisch oder durch Ombudsstellen akribisch und ernsthaft aufgearbeitet wird, sondern auch in der öffentlichen Wahrnehmung vorschnell verurteilt.

Die Opfer müssen ernst genommen werden – und trotzdem sind sowohl die Ombudsstellen als auch die Medien offensichtlich zu schlecht darin, ihre eigenen Vorurteile kritisch zu hinterfragen."
Alleine die gestelzt genderneutrale Sprache wirkt sehr gekünstelt. Insgesamt geht es offenbar weniger um kritischen Journalismus als um ein moralisches Statement
Das in Deutschland der tolle Journalismus RBB dich machen
"Das muss dieser Qualitäts Journalismus sein, von dem der ÖRR immer spricht und damit die Beiträge rechtfertigt"
Ich habe die Gründung der Me Too Bewegung seinerzeit sehr begrüßt und unterstützt! Mit der Zeit wurde mir die 'Bewegung aber immer suspekter! Und zutiefst zuwider!
"Dass sich Intendantin Demmer ernsthaft in Respektsbekundungen ergeht, anstatt die Rücktritte von Chefredakteur und Programmdirektorin als eine Selbstverständlichkeit zu bezeichnen, erklärt, weshalb die Zahl jener stetig steigt, die den ÖRR für unreformierbar halten."
"Wie sollen sich denn Menschen, noch finden, wenn sie nicht mehr flirten dürfen? Soll das nur noch über die App laufen?"
Das dumme Gegender ist nervig
"Wenn der RBB scheinbar so ein Saftladen ist, wie viel Saftladen sind dann die anderen Sparten? 🤷"
"Der vorletzte Satz ist aber auch nicht ganz richtig. Es gibt immer wieder große und auch viele kleine Anschuldigungen die falsch sind und wo es glücklicherweise auch raus kommt.
Das ist aber wichtig um zu wissen, dass es sowas eben auch gibt. Es ist nicht die Regel und die meisten Opfer sind auch Opfer, aber eben nicht alle. Das muss man dabei immer für beide Seiten im Hinterkopf haben.
Und wie hier eben auch, nur weil eine Person lügt, heißt das nicht, dass die andere Person fehlerfrei ist.
Man muss immer hinterfragen und, aus gutem Grund, journalistische Standards einhalten. Der allerletzte Satz trifft es da dann doch gut, denn hier haben zumindest wirklich alle Beteiligten verloren, der Journalismus, Herr Gelbhaar, die Person die ihn falsch verdächtigt hat und alle Leute die sich wirklich belästigt gefühlt haben."
"Ist ein ""Qualitätsmedium"" das sich nicht an Standards hält denn wirklich ein Qualitätsmedium?"
"Zum Thema ""übersehene Perspektiven"": Im Beitrag kommen vier Journalistinnen und nur ein Journalist zu Wort: Christian Latz, Ann Katrin Müller, Lena Kampf, Ulrike Demmer, eine nicht genannte Frau ab 19:35. Die Frauen bestehen allesamt darauf, dass es sich um einen Fall von MeToo handele und gehen Gelbhaar in geradezu Inquisitorischer Weise an. Herr Latz schildert lediglich kurz, wie er die konstruierten Vorwürfe gegen Gelbhaar aufgedeckt hat. Der ganze Beitrag ist im Ergebnis dezidiert tendenziös und setzt das Narrativ vom mächtigen sexuellen Belästiger Gelbhaar fort. Ein entsetzliches Beispiel für den ""Haltungsjournalismus""."
"19:10 Es ist schon irgendwo ironisch, dass in einem Bericht, in dem es um Vorverurteilungen geht, so eine Frage gestellt wird. Er wehrt sich dagegen Punkt. Wenn er unschuldig ist, ist das nicht überraschend, wenn er schuldig ist aber auch nicht. Das einzige, was mit dieser Frage erreicht wird ist Framing. Interessanter wäre gewesen, was gefragt wurde, als er das Interview abgebrochen hat. Dass er das macht, anstatt alles für haltlos zu erklären, ist auch interessant. Das wird aber leider nicht gezeigt."
"Dass am Ende des Beitrags auf die ""Opfer sexueller Gewalt"" verwiesen wird, obwohl die verbliebenen Vorwürfe gegen Gelbhaar damit nichts zu tun haben, ist erschreckend. Was soll dieses Framing?"
"Beschämend, verlogen etc.👎👎👎"
Mit diesem Bericht ist der NDR seinem Ruf absolut gerecht geworden.
"Welche lächerlichen Argumente ... er habe sie bei einem Gespräch mal am Arm, mal am Rücken BERÜHRT ..."
"Hier wird offensichtliche Korruption wenigstens nicht totgeschwiegen!
Hier wird die Korruption schön eingeordnet und relativiert.
-> Qualitätsmedium"
"Das mit dem Machtverhältnis halte ich für sehr schwierig. Wollen wir nur noch Partnerschaften zwischen wirtschaftlich gleich gestellten Personen erlauben?
Viele junge Frauen sind mit älteren gut verdienenden Männern zusammen. Was machen wir daraus?
Die alten Männer dafür verurteilen, dass sie auf junge Frauen zugehen, oder die Frauen dafür verurteilen, dass sie bei der Partnersuche anscheinend auf das Geld achten?"
"Wäre dieser Beitrag ein Schulaufsatz, würde der Lehrer ""Thema verfehlt"" drunter schreiben.
Hier geht es um eine politische Intrige. Solche gab es in der Politik leider schon immer, um parteiinterne Konkurrenten aus dem Weg zu räumen, damit für einen selbst der Weg auf den ersehnten Posten frei wird. Dabei ist der Grund der Anschuldigung zweitrangig und wechselt mit der Zeit ( noch in den 80ern war beispielsweise der Vorwurf der Homosexualität ein Totschlagargument). Die eigentliche Frage ist aber ""Wem nutzt es ? "". Also wer hat von dieser Intrige profitiert und wer hat sie insziniert. Und natürlich die Motive der Helfershelfer beim RBB. Waren sie wirklich so naiv oder schlichtweg Komplizen der Intrige ?
Keine dieser Fragen wird beantwortet oder auch nur gestellt. Stattdessen Me too Gelaber und die Unterstellung, es könne vielleicht doch etwas dran sein an den Vorwürfen der sexuellen Belästigung."
Eine Feministin von Dpiegel zu Fragen ist an Blödheit nicht zu überbieten.
"framing: metoo wurde beschädigt, so geht ÖRR . was ist metoo: Vorverurteilung und Vernichtung von Männern , ohne etwas juristisch Verwertbares in der Hand zu haben"
Das erste Drittel hatte offensichtlich nur einen Alibi-Zweck.
tl;dr: der Grünen-Ideologiepartei gehts um Macht. Wundert das irgendwen? Mich nicht. Gute Nacht!
"Es wäre gut klarzustellen das ""eidestattliche Versicherungen"" gegenüber Medien genau nichts Wert sind. Es hat keine Konsequenzen wenn diese falsch sind. Es ist genau definiert welche Behörden eine solche Versicherung abnehmen können..."
"Wenn man erwischt wurde, ist das Wort ""Verantwortungskultur"" Schwachdeutsch!"
"Das wird das wohl beste Spiel des Herrn Audretsch gewesen sein. 
Da kann man nur den Hut ziehen.
Bezüglich Herrn Gelbhaar tuts mir leid. Seine Position war einfach zu begehrt. Zur falschen Zeit auf dem falschen Listenplatz."
Bei Stottersprech bin ich sofort raus
25:52 Zapp hat die Relativierung nicht nur gefressen sondern als Fazit eingeschnitten.
"""geht mit aller Härte gerichtlich dagegen vor“ wie soll man den gegen so schwere Vorwürfe vorgehen?"
"""... Sie waren überfordert damit, wie sagt man einem Bundestagsabgeordneten, das man einen Kontakt haben möchte, aber anders?"" Und das ist dann das Problem des Bundestagsabgeordneten? Dann muss die Person sich halt Rat holen, aber nicht Dinge kritisieren, welche man einfach abstellen kann, nur diese Person halt nicht. Wenn mein Gegenüber mir nicht mitteilt, dass etwas für Sie/Ihn nicht in Ordnung ist, dann ist das nicht mein Problem."
"""Reporter:innen"" 🙄"
kennt man von Kachelmann ...nichts neues
"Irgendwie wird man in dieser Diskussion als junge Frau zum unmündigen Kind gemacht. Wenn Gelbhaar dafür geschätzt wurde, auf Augenhöhe zu kommunizieren, dann kann man doch erstmal davon ausgehen, dass er eine Grenzziehung auf Augenhöhe nicht mit einer Machtdemonstration beantworten würde."
"So sieht Journalismus in Deutschland aus 😂😂😂 
ein Witz einfach."
"Andere fertigzumachen , zu ruinieren und dann unterzutauchen verdient überhaupt keinen Respekt!!!!! Die sollen aus der Deckung kommen und sich öffentlich entschuldigen und vor Gericht angeklagt werden."
"und immer wieder :innen, kann man in der Pfeife rauchen!"
Trozdem ist diese doku immernoch als vorwurf gegen ihn formuliert .... Anscheinend lernt man nicht aus den fehlern .....
">""Zuschauende""  sind Personen , die gerade etwas schauen, ""Zuschauer"" sind Personen in ihrer Rolle als Zuschauer, also zeitunabhängig, z.B. einen youtube clip - soweit  zur Causa ZAPP"
"Wie sagen die Amerikaner so schön: you don't fish off the company pier! Keine Flirts am Arbeitsplatz! Keine unnötigen Berührungen, keine zweideutigen Sprüche und kompromitierende Situationen vermeiden!"
Ich bleib da konsequent! Wenn gegendert wird bin ich raus. Somit war die Reportage bei mir schon nach 3 Minuten beendet. Hört auf unsere deutsche Sprache zu verschandeln!
Wer hat denn den größten Profit aus dem Rücktritt Hr. Gelbhaars erwirtschaftet?
"nein es haben nicht alle verloren, es ist ein Lehrstück und wer das nicht erkennt ist der Verlierer. Das Schlusszitat ist ärgerlich und zeigt das die Redaktion ihre Lektion nicht gelernt hat."
"14:40 Mal eine Frage, würde diese Journalistin auch sagen, dass man ""MeToo"" auch dazu benutzen wollte um Gelbhaar zu schaden. Dass sich zumindest die Journalisten des RBB, spätestens als man sich entschied die Alibis von Gelbhaar gänzlich zu ignorieren, darüber bewusst waren welchen Zweck diese Vorwürfe offensichtlich hatten?"
Das ist der wunderbare deutsche Journalismus   Das passiert momentan ununterbrochen in diesem besten Deutschland aller Zeiten. Sorgfalt gibt es dort nicht mehr. Ist auch nicht erwünscht
1:39 Da sitzt der große Nutznießer. Zwischen Spitzenkandidatin und damals noch Ministerin Paus und Helga Feddersen.
Euer gendern macht den ganzen Bericht kaputt
euer ernst..flirten wird hier als Grenzüberschreitung gewertet...dumm
"@ZAPP  Was ist denn in Minute 18:30 die ""vermeintliche Einladung in eine private Wohnung""? Eine vermeintliche Einlandung, ist doch gesichert keine Einladung! Ein vermeintlicher Dieb ist kein Dieb, sondern jemand der fälschlich für einen Dieb gehalten wurde. Was ist denn hier mit VERMEINTLICH gemeint?
 
Das ist doch ein Vorwurf, der offensichtlich gar kein Vorwurf war, sondern nur für einen Vorwurf gehalten wurde, oder? Sonst wärs ja keine vermeintliche Einladung, sondern eine Einladung!"
Schade 🥼🥼🥼 für die Grünen. Schade für unsere demokratische  Zukunft in diesen schweren Zeiten.
Endweder richtig oder gar nicht NDR.  So nur peinlich....RBB  ermittelt und so 😅
"Der beste Beweis, als Mann bist du in solchen Fällen schuldig bis du freigesprochen wirst. Und selbst dann bist du ja eigentlich doch schuldig."
@zapp leider nicht neutral
"Alte Weisheit ""gib einem Ferkel einen Posten, schon wird es zur Sau""  trifft leider quer Beet zu😕"
"Noch eine Anmerkung zu Min 19:26: Scheinbar ist der Redakteurin der Ablauf im Eilverfahren nicht bekannt. Seit 2020 muss in solchen Fällen immer die Gegenseite angehört werden, was hier auch tatsächlich passiert ist. Klara Schädlich hat ihre Argumente vorgebracht und trotzdem hat das Gericht so entschieden. Hat Gelbhaar das nicht gesagt? Haben Sie das rausgeschnitten?"
Junge Frauen sollten erstmal was lernen und nicht gleich von der Schulbank in die Politik gehen. Die Grüne Partei hat auch Verantwortung!!!!!!!!❤
Minute 10:44 : Der gute Ruf des RBB :))) ich brech ab... das meinen die noch ernst
"JA ÖRF ""Ihr habt alles richtig gemacht"", ""Ihr habt aufgeklärt und Konsequenzen gezogen""!
Notiz an mich: JA ich bin ein zynischer Mensch."
"10:14 Kriese, das ich nicht lache, und das da zwei zurückgetreten sind soll wohl eine Strafe darstellen? Schonmal deren Abfindungen und Zahlungen gesehen?"
Unglaublich was hier angerichtet wurde und welche Debatten man heute über solche Fälle führt.
5 ans avec sursis et 5 viols ? Apres on s'étonne qu'on porte pas plainte... Justice a la con !
Interdiction d'exercice et interdiction de poursuite des études médicales.
Il est juste étudiant et il fait déjà des dégâts en stage ! Qu'est-ce que cela sera quand il sera seul avec une patiente dans son cabinet ! Pour moi c'est un malade pervers et ça ne m'étonnerais pas le choix de cette branche en médecine !!!
"S'il devient médecin, même généraliste, il continuera !!!!"
Tolérance zéro qu'on lui interdise d exercer.
Le rêve français. C’est beau l’impunité
"C'est meme pas l'hopital ou la fac le problème, cette personne devrait être en PRISON pour au moins 15 ans...."
"1/ du sursis pour 5 viols!!! On ne parle pas d'une occurrence alcoolisée avec une erreur d'interprétation, etc. On parle de recidive!!!! 
2/ un métier où on est souvent amené à etre seul avec un patient diminué !!! Certains métiers devraient etre interdits à certains profils ou alors on prévient le patient avant. Attention vous allez etre en tete à tete avec un violeur. Perso je ny vais pas pu si je nai pas me choix, je demande la presence d'une personne de confiance avec moi."
"Six mois avec sursis 😮 , sérieusement 😢😢
Quand à la fac de médecine.... Toujours fière de leur serment d'hypocrite 😢😢😢"
"Parce que ceux qui donnent la sentence font ce genre de chose… ils ont du rigole au tribunal ´ha bah faut être plus discret mon cher ami ´
Les viols et la pedoxxxcrimxxx c’est grave chez nous! Comme le juge chargé des affaires pedxcrimixxxx qui a été pris sur des sites degueulasses entrain d’échanger des photos de sa fille…"
Décidément certains avocats ont vraiment pour passion de défendre des agresseurs sexuels continuez comme ça les gars continuez à défendre ses monstres
"5 ans avec sursis, la commence la honte"
"Est-ce la même chose pour l'alcool au volant dans un ""Cadre festif"" et non au travail?"
Il y a tellement de médecins qui sont des prédateurs mais je trouve que c'est assez tabou encore même si les langues se délient.
"Élève,  polanski, jakubowitz, le laxisme et l'inaction. Il s'appelle comment cet heureux élu 😅"
"😳'' c'était dans un cadre festif, ça n'a rien a voir avec ses études ''  😳❗
C'est comme Dupont Moretti, c'était dans un cadre où il était avocat, ça n'a rien a voir avec son ministère 😳❗
C'est comme Fabius pour le sang contaminé, c'était dans le cadre de son ministère, ça n'a rien a voir avec sa responsabilité civile 😳❗
🤨Non mais qui ose encore appelé le système judiciaire français, la justice 🤦."
5 ans avec surcis pour 5 agressions sexuels mais un SDF condamné à 6 mois ferme pour avoir volé des bouteilles de shampoing. On voit la priorité de la justice française.
Cet etudiant: stephane delatre
Mdr c est festif de v......quelqu un
"Le viol c'est donc autorisé dans les cadres festifs et privés, merci de l'information...."
On peut être interdit de territoire dans tout un département  ???
Il va finir politique
"Un condamné, combien de violeurs en libertés ?"
"Pourquoi en tant qu'infirmière, dans nos études et pour chacun de nos emplois, on doit fournir un extrait de nos casiers judiciaires et pas les médecins ?"
"OK donc t'agresse des femmes on te change juste d'école 
😂
OK on est vraiment en france"
Pourquoi cet étudiant est-il couvert ?
Également avocat de Lelandais
"Quand on voit la tête du mec qui le défend ,on a directement compris 😂 . Après on est en France attouchement sexuel pédophilie viol ça fait partie des meubles ! Il peut même faire de la politique,ah ouais du moment qu'on a un problème avec la justice, minimum ministre !"
Bizarrement ont voit pas les racistes qui nous disent encore un kevin ou mateo. Jne chance pour la France. Radié point!
"Le parcours du combattant pour arrêter ce violeur, donc il agissait en toute impunité et la Fac n’a rien fait… magnifique !"
Scandaleux.
"Les excuses sont donc que c'était hors du travail? 
ALORS, Prenons un exemple similaire! Ceux qui sont chargés d'apprendre à conduire les poids lourds, bus, etc. Si ils ont une amende et retrait de permis, ils sont *renvoyés!* Et ne peuvent plus enseigner, donc.
Cette justice est déplorable."
"merci j'ai signé la pétition et à Tours cette histoire était connu dans les milieux militants. Honte à la justice. Qu'il soit sous médicament qui lui couic ses ""désirs"" et pourtant je suis pas pour des médocs à tout va mais là"
"Ça ces notre beau pays !! un voleur de nourriture prendra du ferme un violeur prendra du sursis , cette justice ces : Touche à ma fille , Mets touche pas à mon portefeuille. Quel honte ce pays !!!"
il ira en Hongrie ou Belgique pour terminer ses études et exercera en France.
Et cet étudiant doit appartenir à une communauté très puissante😮
"ALLUCINANT, grrrrr"
"Cet avocat a defendu Nordhal Lelandais...
Bref !"
"Je ne comprendrais jamais pour quelle raison en France personne ne se positionne en faveur des victimes. Mais quel est leur problème ? Je ne comprends pas pourquoi on défend les pédophiles et les violeurs et on condamne deux trois pauvres gars qui vendent du shit à des peines bien plus graves.... 
Pays en dérive complète.... Société malade 😮"
La gynécologie et obstétrique devrait être interdit à l'homme.
"Une vraie vocation chez lui, la gynécologie..."
Justice soi. Même….
Parcequ'il ėtait toujours autorisé à des cours de gynécologie.... normalement il est interdit nationalement et la sanction des écoles est sans retour
"Avocat de polanski? Tout est dit. Enfant de boss, avocat de boss, jugement de boss"
Qui protège cet étudiant ? Et surtout qui protégera ses futures patientes ? Notre système judiciaire est une honte.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻rien à rajouter
C'est complètement dingue cette histoire
5 v*ol -> 5ans de prison Les personnes v**lées -> Reste gravé à jamais ou du moins longtemps. Courage à toutes les personnes qui ont subis ce jaure de choses.❤️🕊️
Honteux 😢 belle justice si elle existe 😢
J'imagine que personne ne fera aucun lien dans cette affaire 😅
"Le principal, c'est quand même qu'il soit un BON médecin, capable de SOIGNER les gens qui ont une vraie MALADIE. Je ne me fais aucun souci pour les ""agressées"" qui auront toujours toute latitude pour se plaindre. Quand on sait ce qui est qualifié ""d'agression"" par beaucoup de victimes, on prend peur pour leur santé mentale."
"Honte à la justice.
Honte à l'université."
Deja un homme qui veut travailler la dedans c'est déjà bizarre
ca donne envie de se faire justice soit meme. Ce monde est corrompu et injuste.
"Le principe de précaution pour la protection des patientes ,par pitié !!!!"
Incroyable...
"Je veux bien que l'avocat laisse à cet étudiant, la possibilité de donner des cours particuliers à ses filles. C'était dans un cadre festif, donc ça va passe"
Le laxisme des responsables judiciaires et de nos fonctionnaires en charge de respecter leurs missions et au service des citoyens.
"Pour info, son avocat à défendu nordal lelandais🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮"
Suis je étonnée de l absence de réaction et de la décision de la justice .... Non. On sait d'avance qu'elle sera la décision... Comme d'hab injuste décevante et incompréhensible.... Le monde devient fou. Que Dieu nous protège.
"C’est pas rare qu’en médecine il y ait des cas d’agression. Pour avoir étudié dans la filière deux ans, je me rappelle qu’il y a déjà eu des cas d’attouchement et vi*l dans ma promo. On peut avoir peur si c’est ça les médecins de demain."
"Sans trop de rapport, évitez de mettre des lumières clignotantes dans les vidéos, merci. Les épileptiques vous remercieront."
"5 plaintes Rhooo. Ça va  .. faut pas chipoter,.. sympa l avocat , voit clairement qu il métrise le sujet , il a les moyens le stagiaire ! Issue de  bonne famille .."
"5 ans avec sursis mais où est Bardella pour en parler, c'est incroyable."
"vive la justice du pays des droits de l’homme , elle fait honte a beaucoup."
Il est le fils de qui?
Ont veut son nom ?
"J'adore l'argument ""oui mais c'était pas de le cadre de ses études""... Ben oui parce que c'est bien connu qu'un gars qui sait pas se tenir en dehors de son école va se tenir quand il aura plus de profs et un permis d'exercer... en particulier dans une profession où il sera face à des femmes à moitié nues et vulnérables...

5 viols c'est pas juste un malentendu avec une copine pendant une soirée, c'est de la perversion à ce niveau là et c'est dangereux de laisser ce mec exercer dans le milieu médical. Si on refuse les gens avec des casiers judiciaires dans la fonction publique, il y a une raison et pour les métiers de la santé ça devrait être pareil.

D'ailleurs je comprends pas non plus qu'après 5 viols reconnus le gars ait pas une obligation de soins parce que ça va clairement pas dans sa tête."
D'accord donc le mec à 5 plainte pour agression sexuelle et vous le mettez en gynécologie gg gars
Prendre de l’argent à l’état et plus grave que de violer une personne si la justice continue à être autant bête il y’aura plus d’agresseur que de dealer
😱😱😱😡
Alors la c fou... comment il faut se battre pour se protéger et etre en sécurité
il faut donner son nom et sa photo un point c'est tout. Comme ça il se sauvera loin pour se cacher
J'ai travaillé avec le Cabinet Jakubowicz
L'humanité va de mieux en mieux ..
C'est quoi cette Justice qui protège les violeurs et autres Pédos et emprisonnent les victimes??!!! LA C'EST TROOOOPP!!!
"Pas de nom, pas de pays d’origine ?😂 s’agirait t’il de Louis?😂"
Bizzare cette justice qui ne souhaite pas condamner les viols au sein de la société.
La bonne question c'est qui est derrière (papa ou tonton) pour qu'il soit aussi protégé.
"Waouh l'argument de l'avocat ""oui i la violé mais ce n'était pas dans le même contexte donc ca compte pas"" ??? 
Dans ce cas on ne peut *jamais* privé quelqu'un d'accès, ni même l'emprisonner, car le contexte change toujours (au pire il y a la temporalité ""c'était avant"").
Bon après c'est le boulot de l'avocat de défendre sont client, mais le Juge ! Comment a-t-il put accepter cela ?"
Tiens tiens défendu par jackubovitz l'ancien patron du CRIF ça sent la communauté de l'anneau ça....😏
"Pas besoin de l’exclure de la fac, 20/30 de prison ca suffit il recommencera ses études a 50ans"
"On vit dans un monde ou des personne qui vole de largent de quelconques maniere prennent plus de temps de prison que des violeur en tout genre.
Cest a ce moment la quon sait que largent dirige le monde et pas le coeur."
Quand on voit qui est son avocat On se demande de quelle communaute
"Pour le coup il est nécessaire de différencier vie professionnelle et vie privée, un crime commis dans un milieu n'a pas forcément d'influence sur l'autre. Si ça avait été pendant les examens réalisés là oui il faut faire quelque chose, si c'est en privé c'est totalement différent."
"a une epoque pas très lointaine, les etudiants se seraient occupe de son cas sans l'aide des tribunaux!. Un petit coup de bistouri au bon endroit, et le probleme est resolu."
"Déjà il n'a pas à être viré de son travail si ces faits ont été en dehors du lieu de travail. Ensuite il a été reconnu coupable, donc il devrait aller en prison si ces faits sont en l'état des viols. Si les faits ne sont pas reconnus, rien. Si ces faits sont reconnus : prison .. c'est pas compliqué."
"Mais je vois que beaucoup ne comprennent toujours rien! 2 poids 2 mesures c'est gens la peuvent faire des génocides sans sanction, alors des viols!!!!! ils sont intouchable!"
Il a bien été orienté... Professionnellement parlant 😞

Tina stayed with Ike for 16 years before she left…
"I drove a Taxi for many years.  And I helped many women get out of an abusive relationship and to a shelter where she and, usually, her kids, could be safe at last.  I know first-hand how hard it is to get away from an abusive man, so when someone named Twigs says she could have bought a plane ticket any time, it makes me mad.  Most women trapped in abusive relationships don't have that easy out."
"I left my abuser, it was sure a lot easier than staying. Then I get a call recently form his current wife of 15 years that she's leaving. Surprise! he didn't change, the victim just did."
Fear is a powerful tool. It can take time to build the courage to make the move you need to make. An abuser will weaken you that is their game. In the beginning if you sense something is wrong it is. Get out early before it gets worse.
"For the love of god fire that guy that always says ""yeah"" to everything. He does it in every monologue and it's annoying as hell"
"Rest in peace, Tina Turner. And thank you for everything you’ve given us."
Tina was with Ike a long time before she left. This is not an issue and problem to be so easily solved. If only it was so easy.
I watch on mute at this point and read subtitles.  The fake audience reactions are getting worse.
"Most women trapped in these relationships weren't selected by accident. There is usually something in their past that primed them for it, and reactivated, prevents them leaving, especially if they were childhood abuse survivors who literally depended on their abusers to survive. This can have lifelong effects on agency.

Also, you can't discount the strength of coercive control, the extent of gaslighting that affects your reality until you believe you are the problem (especially if your trauma response is Flight or Fight), the constant C-PTSD scrambling your brain and leaving you sleep-deprived til you can't think your way out, the fear of retribution, old, destructive trauma responses such as Freeze or Fawn which actually put you back into harm's way or means you just just shut down or placate them without realising, or put yourself in harm's way to save your kids. 

All trauma messes with executive function, which is the thing you need to plan and pack. You could have had all the agency in the world before you got abused but if you can't think or make decisions, you won't get far alone. And this is while you're trying to work out if you're 'overreacting', as your partner tells you, or you imagined it, or you're going mad, or it's your old trauma causing it or changing how you see it, or you took it the wrong way, or you started it, or deserved it, and all the other counter-narratives they'll tell you to stop you going. And that exists in a sexist soup of people telling you women who leave are manipulative, man-hating gold-diggers.

Then there's codependency, financial abuse, the lack of social circle because the abuser cut your ties with people, so you may have noone left to turn to, and outside of shelters, probably don't have anyone who understands. Or the dopamine hit in the DV cycle where victims start to rely on the ""I'm sorry"" phase to make everything better.

I'm so tired of hearing the 'why don't women just leave?' argument from people who are judging from a place of ignorance and essentially, privilege. If you don't get it because you could plan and pack up, you could think straight. you have self-esteem and financial resources and you see yourself as an independent person, you aren't in the same boat. To many abused women, that's like an Olympic athlete wondering why you don't just run fast enough to get a medal."
The audience “yeah!” guy is the new audience “wooo!” guy.
"If only it was that simple...
Unfortunately, oversimplifying a subject doesn't make it so."
"Thanks, Bill for telling people ""just to leave,"" an abusive relationship. Don't think they ever thought about that!"
"As a woman who has been abused, there is a psyhologial effect that happens to the point where you even gaslight yourself. You can't really believe that someone is doing this to you, you wonder so many things  Abuse damages your mind and unless you have gone through it you won't ever understand it, these are facts."
"All these people/women telling Bill he is not a woman and has never been in an abusive relationship should accept that they are not men, and have never been in an abusive relationship from the man's standpoint. Abuse comes in every shape and form, right? A lot of men are being abused in very subtle and twisted ways too, and are being held fully responsible for their reactions (which I agree they should) while the other party is never held accountable... Go ahead, I am ready."
"Post separation abuse is VERY real and often way WORSE than the abuse experienced in the relationship!!  Abuse is all about control and when a victim leaves, it harms their ego and amps up their need for control.  There are MANY cases of victims who have left their abuser only to end up dead. So it’s not so simple to “just leave” an abuser."
It's like you can hear the applause light sparking on and off
The most dangerous time in an abusive relationship is when they try to leave.
"Bro, no. You are so out of touch, it’s incredible. How dare you?! The Nerve show has you nailed the wall on this. I suggest you apologize, but you’re gonna have a real hard time digging yourself out of this PR hole. I’ve lost all respect for you as a man."
"I find myself agreeing with Bill Maher on just about everything these days. One of the things I've hated about the Me Too movement is the infantilization of women in certain situations. Listening to a woman claim that she wasn't responsible for a one-night stand because she was ""verbally coerced"" is the pinnacle of pathetic. Just because you regret a decision doesn't mean you have the right to abdicate responsibility for it. Equating casual flirting with actual rape is also completely unhinged. I genuinely feel bad for men these days because feminists have turned every interaction into a battlefield. The actress Brie Larson whined about having to be on ""the defense"" because a guy asked her for her number. Complaints like that undermine the very real issue of sexual violence. Crying wolf over these type of situations conditions people to ignore or question the veracity of accounts of sexual violence."
"He’s leaving out the psychological effects of the abuse, how it twists the mind of the victim."
"The most dangerous time/highest mortality risk for a woman in an abusive relationship are when she's pregnant/having a kid, and when she decides to leave. You don't know what threats Cassi or other victims had hanging over their head. But thanks for being the new expert. For laughs. Well done."
People who never been a victim of domestic violence don’t understand and never will. Victims are manipulated and isolated. Their lives are at risk when they try to get a way.
The ignorance and arrogance of Bill Maher lecturing and shaming women for staying in abusive relationships. I've been a fan of the show for years but not after this.
"Like when Bill offers parenting advice, I will file this one in the “out of his depth” category."
Unfortunately a lot of women in abusive relationships were also abused as children and it takes them a long time to realize they’re worth more.
Just this week my town had not one but two cases of women murdered by the exes who didn't appreciate separating
As a fan I was SO disappointed with this.. .Bill Maher understands NOTHING about domestic abuse...please educate yourself on the subject Bill before talking about it.
Great I never thought I would see Bill try to be a therapist for abused women. Victim blaming is not the solution bill. What about all the young boys that were abused for decades until we finally uncovered the systematic cover-up and abused by the church. Should they have spoken up earlier as well?
What about the grown men 2x the size of Cassie and probably stronger than Diddy who admitted that their silence was due to fear of what Diddy would do?
"I experienced childhood SA and have been a part of many support/therapy groups for survivors. Of the people who went to the police, 0% were helpful. CSA is different than being abused as an adult, but I still doubt that most police departments are helpful in these cases. People often still blame the victims or do very little to help."
"Sorry Bill, you're on the wrong side of this issue.  Kids sometimes don't have the finances or support to leave.  They may have children or dogs they don't want to leave behind and need time to make arrangements.  And abusers often find ways to alienate people from their supports prior to escalating to physical violence.  I agree with you when it comes to people who are very well off, but even then there are sometimes circumstances which make it difficult or even seemingly impossible.  Abusers can threaten to harm loved ones if you leave, and violence is most likely to happen when the victim leaves or threatens to leave.  Most murders of spouse's happen in those circumstances."
"Bill Maher strikes me as the kinda guy who tells women ""oh just calm down, youre so emotional"" and then gets dumped"
"Anyone who has seen the video of Cassie leaving Diddy, only to have to sh&t beat out of her for it by an elevator, knows you sometimes can’t “just leave”. I usually love your show but this was monologue was beyond ignorant."
"This is great advice for the high profile cases of the MeToo movement. Unfortunately for those women and yes men who are in toxic relationships who came from a toxic family it’s not quite as simple as Bill makes it out to be. 

My mother was in an abusive marriage to her second husband. The only reason we got out is he locked us out of the house. I was 13 at the time and when I saw her being thrown out of the bathroom I went across the street and called the cops (and then they called his mother who lived a street behind us), they didn’t really do anything other than have him unload the .357 revolver that was under his driver side seat. I had to go to the store with him and he told me “Next time I’ll give you a reason to call the cops.” 

Some people who are in these types of relationships think that’s the best they deserve and have no where to go and no one to turn to especially when there are kids involved and especially if you live in a neighborhood that is very religious and protect their own as we did. 

So yeah, while Bill makes it sound really easy it’s actually not."
I see that Jake Tapper was a guest. Did he mention his new book 10 or 20 times?
"Guys like this keep coming after you. Coercive control is also very real. There's a reason dogs don't just run away from their owners even if they're off leash and have the chance to make a break for it. There's a reason cult followers don't see the abuse or the many chances to escape until they've left. This is clumsier than usual, step up your game."
"Abuse doesn't always start at level 10. It can build over time. I witnessed this happen to someone i wont mention. As a women, it may be your preganant and the abuse starts. Or after having a kid. 

Then you think about leaving but cry because, where will you go, how humiliated will you be, how will your children see you?

How many of them may blame you for the divorce, for the strugle after?

Yes, today is easier to get help and get attention, but abuse is mental and phsyical.  If you dont have income but have people dependent on you, you have that stress added on top. Plus maybe child support or visitations for your children. So you have to watch your children be around your abuser. 

A single women with her own income, sure. Same for a man. As a man, i had an abusive girlfriend. Developed over time. Alcohol was what triggered it. I cared to try and help and suffer through it but I eventually said no and walked away. 

But i had nothing tying me down, good income and we werent married. So as a man, it was easy and a choice i made because it affected me. 

But many women have to think about their children, how they will provide. How long they will have to fight in court, find a job, take care of the kids all while having to worry about how they are treated when they visit the husband. And even if the women gets away.

Say she wins in court, he is arrested, put in jail. The income is gone, the mental strain of explaining to your kids, family and friends. The embarassment you might feel. Then, who knows, your own kids blame you. Thats probably the worst.

And this can happen to men as well, just not as comon but can happen. 

If your a grown adult, are not dependent on a spouse, then walk away if they abuse you. Thats easy. Especially if your rich. 

If your low income, have kids, bills etc. Not so much."
To paraphrase: “If you don’t fit my definition of the perfect victim then you don’t deserve to have your experience heard.”
I don’t think he understands how real world works.
I’m an abuse victim and speaking from experience it really isn’t that easy for most. I have kids involved and that makes it 100x worse
"Kids, money, fear of being literally murdered when you try to leave…… there are still reasons why it takes some time to get out of DV situations safely."
wow bill maher just solved domestic abuse cases worldwide. what a genius
This is so wrong Bill! You are not taking into account the challenge of recognising entrapment perpetrated by a powerful person.
"You have no idea, Bill.  Stay in your own lane."
Provocative essay. The issue is parents don't teach their sons or daughters to not put up with abuse. You have to actively teach this
"Always great to see a guy tell victims of abuse they need to set better boundaries with their abuser (or leave the relationship. Even tho they fear for their life and are being perpetually psychologically conditioned.) ... Life is just a lot easier to do when your really rich, giving you options of moving, being able to pay a lawyer to defend yourself in court.... I just don't get how anyone thinks it's fun to dunk on victims of abuse?"
"100% right! If you are being mistreated do not stay. Its crazy that someone files a complaint 15 years later and we are expected to take their word for it. You can't do that when it comes to racism, police brutality, work mistreatment or for anything else on the planet. Much less still be sleeping with the person, somtimes initiating the behavior in question, taking their money, and going on trips with them--RIDICULOUS!  Stuff like this makes it harder for women who are true victims."
Emmanuel Macron is the president of France and he can’t get away from his allegedly abusive wife. How does Bill Maher expect a regular person to leave an abusive partner?
You have no idea the mental and physical power an abuser has over his victim
As a rape victim who faught kicking and screaming and other rape victims that I know I believe we can all agree collectively we find the me too movement infuriating to hear that women who didn't leave when they clearly had the choice to do so are now the real victims. This we do not understand.
"Oh poor Bill, never married or a father, giving women advice on how to leave an abusive relationship. Deluded, uninformed man. His ego has no bounds. 😮"
"You may not remember this, but just 50 years ago, getting a divorce was a radical, push back against family and church and society. And abusers are everywhere. In your family of origin, the workplace, church, general public. Women should be protected. 
In P. Diddy’s case, as well as other high-profile cases, the situation is extreme. The benefits to staying are enormous and the reasons against leaving are huge. Unrestricted and unaccountable violence, public shame and blacklisting."
BILL- I was a huge fan for years.  Never miss an episode of Real Time or Club Random.  Love your centrist views and humor. Thought you were hilarious and the smartest guy with a platform.  But this editorial is ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. You should be ashamed. YOU NEED TO ISSUE A RETRACTION AND AN APOLOGY
"There's a thing called trauma bonding, it's a real thing Bill, look into it before you condem women for staying too long, or placating their abuser out of survival, when your life or your children's life is threatened, you will play the game as long as you can, including sexual games , you will do whatever they say, especially when you've lost all hope, have only fear, and can't see a way out, she did run from him and he ran after her and kick the shit out of her, so Billy boy, don't lecture what you know nothing about!!!!!!"
The moment he brought up metoo you could hear a needle drop in that studio.
"Sorry Bill, but how dare you ask people to be accountable for their own bad choices? The children are victims, drugged women/men are victims, girlfriends are enablers."
And don't make false accusations.
"In Cassie’s case though she was very very young and grooming is a factor. They knew each other when she was 19… when she was 21 he bombarded her with all the affection and “treated well “. Months later the crazy happened. She didn’t really have a baseline of what relationships should and would be. Also it is not uncommon for women to protect their abuser too. There is more on a psychological level to this. Also there is still love there despite the craziness she went through.  Still to this day I have fear of my ex but if I was alone with him my brain goes in survival mode and would just comply. I left when he was passed out. And went to a shelter. I also had to cut out his family as they would just bring me back.  I was with my ex from the time I was 17-24 with 3 kids I’m 48 now.  Just want to give perspective. Also Cassie was subpoenaed by the government the government because they are trying to get Diddy on Rico charges, and if it wasn’t for that security guard, grabbing a screen video of what happened they would not have had the evidence of how violent he actually was."
"Cassie's texts - simple:  she was fawning. Playing along. Complying. Obeying. Being submissive. Doing and saying what she felt she had to at that point to keep the predator pacified and satisfied.  That's the game you find yourself playing in order to try to create and or maintain whatever it is that seems like relative safety / the possible best outcome of a dangerous situation at that point.

It's also interesting to know that apparently he had her drugged half the time. To help keep her from trying to walk away / keep her under his control.  

This whole thing is so sick and tragic."
What would abused women do without this profound advise. Disgusting.🙄
Has anyone thought of telling men to not abuse women?
If only leaving really were that easy for so many women... some ignorance here.
"Tell me you don't understand abuse without telling me you don't understand abuse, Bill."
Tina Turner suffered many year before she found the strength to leave ❤ 💪💯
"4:52 Best bit of the show in years. Shut up the ""yeah!!"" guy."
I love Bill. Agree with him on many issues. This is one he should have left alone. 1. He is a man. 2. He will never be a woman in an abusive relationship. I love how people like to make a problem black and white. The psychological manipulation that transpires in an abusive relationship is powerful. He obviously didn’t see the footage of Cassie being dragged down a hallway in a hotel and kicked. Diddy was a powerful man and he could convince a woman he would find her wherever she would hide. Please Bill stick with politics. You have no idea the experience of an abused woman so no clue how to stop it. It’s never just as simple as LEAVE or women would be doing that.
Stockholm Syndrome is a thing.
"Obviously Bill didn’t read Tina’s book 
“Happiness Becomes you “ not smart enough Bill ?????
She prepared her escape it took years ! She was terrified! 
Read it Bill and stop insulting women like myself"
"I remember when I watched Bill Maher because you got to see an informed dialog between opposing viewpoints. Now he just trashes on the younger generation and anyone who opposes the ""Jen O'Side""(google blocks it every time I use the correct spelling, thanks algorithm) in Gaza. You lost me Bill."
We literally saw a video of her trying to leave a situation with him and watched him beat and kick and drag her back into that situation. Many people understood by watching that wasn't a 1st occasion or 1 off on his behavior towards her.
"Abuse is horrific but you don’t need to send text messages expressing you are ready for the next time. 

Very good monologue as hard as it may be to swallow."
I have been an abusive relationship situation myself and I can assure you Bill you are talking out your arse.
"When he first started speaking, I wasn't sure I was going to like it.  But by the end, I thought Bill had a point.
What's truly depressing, reading the comment section, is the amount of people watching this channel who have Zero ability to hear and tolerate Nuance.  Like: ""How dare you suggest that some people have some responsibility in their own lives!""  It's Hard!  My mother was abused!  Anything that is true for one person is true for all!!!!!  (It's not.)  Take a breather people.  You are Exhausting."
"I’m mixed about this one. Yes, anyone in an abusive relationship should walk away. Unfortunately, sometimes people are too afraid to do it and that’s where we need to step in to help. The me too movement went too far and it ended up allowing random and baseless accusations. That needs to be addressed. Maher is right. No one is forcing you to send messages like the ones on here, in writing, saying how into it you are. You can’t just say you’re bullied into it. If it’s in writing and your own words, I’m going to believe you meant it. Maher said at 6:20 what lots of people, I’d say the majority, have believed since me too, but have been too afraid to say it. If you’re going to repeatedly allow someone to do things to you in exchange for money and fame, then yes, you do have some of the blame. I’ll say this, Rose McGowan wasn’t complaining about Weinstein when she was getting roles, but when the roles dried up, she then became a victim. Doesn’t change the fact he’s garbage and deserves what he got, but don’t reap them benefits when it’s convenient and then switch it up. I’m also not interested in anything that happened decades ago. If it happened, report it, don’t be like the woman who had sex with Axl Rose in the 80s and two years ago tried to say he sa’ed her, the day before the statute of limitations ran out."
YESS BILL SOOOO TRUE!! This needs to be said more TO BOTH WOMEN AND MEN. BUT WOMEN IN GENERAL
"It's easy to tell someone else that they just shouldn't put up with abuse. But things are not black and white. I was in a relationship where everything was great at first. But bit by bit, he started becoming controlling, manipulative, and demeaning. It was so gradual that I didn't recognize it as it was happening. (I also wasn't sure at the time if it really was abuse because he never hit me). The thing is, the manipulation can basically brainwash the person and the abuser isolates the abused from friends and family. I had lost my sense of self and didn't know anymore how to live without him. Even after we finally broke up, I had to work with a therapist for months to undo that damage."
Yes Bill and when women report it done by  powerful people they are often not belived
"Abuse isn’t the only reason a woman stays, you seem to be describing ""women"" as a type of woman without realizing this is the most sensitive subject, it involves women from all kinds, backgrounds, inmigration status even. This monologue is very dangerous, out of touch and uneducated. ""Some of that is on you""? This is said so lightly  it's heartbreaking media still do not understand domestic abuse is so complex. ""Go to police first"" I liked this part, but I think this type of statements could only be said directly to an specific case you know about very well Bill.. like a sister or a friend, but not model it for others as a type of speech to tell all victims of abuse because it can cause damage."
Bill Maher- little man who couldn’t get a girl before he had fame: Shut up. You have no idea what it takes to “just leave”. You’re not helping women or society. Why not ask the ABUSERS to get help “after the first time”?!
"The problem is, sometimes the victim doesn't leave right away because they are in shock, and being mentally manipulated about the abuse.  Sometimes it takes a few months to get your bearings and process the events."
"Maher is clueless. He obviously has no idea the emotional and mental trauma of abusive relationships. ""Just leave"" is what morins who don't understand would say."
"Guess what people who think that it is easy to just go to the police.  Some abused women do leave and they still suffer serious consequences or get murdered by that abuser.  I am not suggesting that those women should have stayed what I am saying is lets be sensitive as to why they stay...they are afraid to leave.  It is not a laughing matter. Bill Maher you should be ashamed.  By saying that these women can leave whenever they want without knowing their personal circumstances you are, in affect, saying that they deserve what they got.  You haven't a clue as to the psychology of an abused person. You are not an expert on anything, especially on abused women."
"Please Bill wake completely up!,!!!"
"Bill are you listening to what Diddy and his compatriots did to men and women? Sweet talk come to my party, drugged  screwed heinous and filmed. Blackmail to follow. They were scared of him. Men scared of what he did to them afraid to speak out."
"To Bill and all the commenters agreeing with him:  it sounds like you should educate yourself on the dynamics behind abusive relationships.  How they happen, why the victim stays or seemingly puts up with it, etc.  In reading the comments for this video you might find a few answers. 

This isn't about modern women, talking about accountability for them, or anything like that.  

Abusers are a real problem in the world and what's very much needed is education on what an abusive relationship is, what abusers are and how they operate.  Finding oneself in an abusive relationship can happen to anyone and even with that knowledge it can be difficult to identify abusers until it's too late and you're no longer safe.  

And that doesn't even cover the pipeline phenomenon of children growing up in abusive homes or getting abused in other ways from non family members, who, find themselves in abusive romantic relationships because they're not educated about abuse and don't understand that without work and education, their past almost makes an abusive romantic relationship the default that they'll find themselves in.  

Unfortunately this is a more complicated and nuanced and sensitive subject that requires an informed, educated understanding of it in order to discuss it responsibly.

Just because Bill and people like you think it's a simple topic with a simple answer doesn't mean it is. 

If it were, abusive relationships wouldn't exist.  People wouldn't fall for them. People wouldn't find themselves in them. People wouldn't find themselves not knowing how the heck to get out without making things even worse, and risking death more than they already are. It's a catch 22 with abusers - stay, hoping he (or she) won't keel you, leave fearing he or she probably will definitely try to now."
"I see a lot of disagreement with Bill on this one but he’s right. People have to start taking accountability. 
I was in abusive relationship where I thought I was in love with the person. I still left after the first noticeable realization that the person was abusing me with manipulation tactics before things got really bad. I was able to do so because I was always taught that I am the only one responsible for my actions. 
If everyone is treated as a victim for theirs actions they co-sign on, well, that’s what they are always going to be… a victim"
I guess I'm the only one who doesn't care about Diddy or this trial?
Just leave…of course why didn’t we women think of that…Cassie was trying to leave when he dragged her back by her hair. Leaving is when women get killed it’s the most dangerous time.
"I can’t watch any more.  The incessant long pauses for the audience to yell and clap for the dumbest, laziest joke writing has jumped the shark.  This show isn’t clever or funny anymore.  The studio audience is either drunk or getting paid for their affirmation of this crap."
"That’s over simplifying the issue. It’s much easier to walk away, if it’s the first or second date. Harder if the transition was insidious, after establishing a dependent relationship. 
Again, not that simple"
This should be retitled “bill mahar suggests women take an adult amount of accountability for their actions and feelings that are equal to that which they demand of everyone else”. I can’t believe they let him do this! This is the first time I’ve ever heard somebody on the left actually call on women to take personally accountability. Can’t imagine it’ll go well.
Bill's gunna get a lot of $hi+ for this lol
"I doubt she really enjoyed any of that abuse. 

She was suffering from battered women’s syndrome. 

I’m sure she would say anything to him Just so he would not beat her."
"Victim blaming? What an old creep. Dude thinks he’s smarter than he is, younger than he is, more popular than he is."
Big facts 💯
"So, by Maher’s POV racism ended when Obama was elected, we have no more drunks because we have AA, women are no longer abuse because we have acknowledged there is a problem all from the man who keeps talking about the girl who dumped him in high school 50 years ago. 
WTF Bill.
Get some much needed therapy to get some badly needed insight."
The reason Cassie seemed enthusiastic in freak off text was probably to appease Diddy so he wouldn't freak out on her. Its different when its a powerful man whose threatening anyone and everyone.
Age doesnt matter when it comes to abuse but Cassie was 19 years old meeting Diddy
"So many of these comments from victims complaining about how ""its not that easy"".  Bill ISNT saying its easy.  He's saying that victims need to USE the tools they have won over the last decade.  That isnt saying ""its easy""."
If your abuser is broke call the police if your abuser is rich call the lawyer

"""Repórter não é juíz. Repórter não é delegado. Repórter não é pra condenar ou inocentar ninguém. O papel do Repórter é apurar os fatos"". Assertiva irretocável. Congratulações a cintilante Adriana Negreiros."
"11:20 a Me Too protocola uma queixa crime contra o Silvio Almeida, pois ele extrapolou a sua liberdade de expressão, alegando que caluniou a ONG sem provas. Ora, não foi exatamente isso que a Me Too fez com o Silvio, denúncia de abuso sexual sem qualquer prova, mesmo 1 ano depois da suposta acusação?"
"Uma verdadeira jornalista, não passa pano e não acusa sem prova concreta. Adriana Negreiros"
Resumo da ópera: a intenção era só DERRUBAR o Silvio Almeida!
"Silvio Almeida  estava se destacando demais, era todo dia nas redes batendo de frente com muita gente poderosa. Estava na cara que ia dar nisso."
Destruíram a vida pública de um homem. Essa ong tem q ser punida
"Se o inquérito foi aberto por conta da denuncia do Me Too e este não tem dados concretos, então o inquérito foi feito sem os dados das vitimas? Ainda bem que existem jornalistas das antigas. Talvez estejamos testemunhando uma denúncia por encomenda."
7:11 - A presunção de inocência é um princípio fundamental do direito. O ônus da prova é de quem acusa.
"Sei não, mas eu tô começando a achar que o Mee Too Miin Tiu"
"Se a ministra dos direitos humanos, Macaé Evaristo, se manifestar contra a privatização de presídios também, será acusada de assédio no dia seguinte."
Caraca! Pode ter sido cometida uma grande injustiça com o Silvio Almeida. Caraca!
"7:21 sim Fabíola, o ministro é inocente até que ele seja condenado. Como qualquer pessoa no nosso país"
"Querem que o Silvio seja acusado e nao se defenda? Fala sério, já desenhado que ele foi injustiçado... Vergonha alheiaaaaaaaaa dessas mulheres"
"Assustada com o que fizeram com o Silvio Almeida, o condenaram em ""praça pública"" sem provas e até agora as provas nao apareceram.... Absurdo, e é inadimissivel que isso aconteça,   a injustiça está se desenhando.... Aguardemos!"
"Dona Adriana dando uma lição de bom jornalismo. Ética n é p todos e todas,infelizmente!"
"Não existe aula de Ética na faculdade de jornalismo? Jornalistas nunca ouviram falar do caso Escola Base? A imprensa está lucrando muito com isso. Antes mesmo do julgamento oficial, do Poder Judiciário, a mídia já destruiu a reputação de uma pessoa."
Esse caso precisa ser esclarecido. Pra que não haja injustiça de nenhum lado.
A Aniele Franco é a aluna mais fraca da Dani Calabrezakkkkkkkkkk
"Uma mulher vingativa, em disputa de poder e de egos, destruindo a imagem de um homem honrado sem absolutamente nenhuma prova."
Tá na cara que Silvio Almeida é inocente!
"A Fabíola inverteu toda a lógica processual e constitucional. Para ela, a pessoa começa o processo condenado, e no curso do mesmo,  o sentenciado pode ou não ser considerado inocente. Voltamos a idade da pedra!!!😅"
"Provavelmente mais um caso de falsa acusação de  abuso sexual, é imprescindível que mulheres que façam essas falsas acusações sejam acusadas e punidas com o rigor"
"Como assim, ""isso não quer dizer que ele é inocente""? Se ele não foi condenado, é legalmente inocente! Pode ser suspeito, mas culpado, ainda não é."
Que papelão da Metoo Brasil...
"Assim como disse o Silvio, "" a aniele se perdeu na personagem"". Sempre foi uma sem noção"
A Madaleine deve estar com raiva... Pq ela acha que reporter tem que ser juiz... Baixo nivel completo.
"Se você diz que uma pessoa é culpada, aprensente as PROVAS."
"Significa que ele é inocente até que se prove o contrário, Fabíola."
Isso tudo foi para prejudicar o Silvio Almeida uma verdadeira vergonha nacional
Desde o início penso: tá mal contato isso aí…
"Fabíoloa Cidral, enquanto não houver provas o Prof. Silvio é inocente, sim."
Minha pergunta é: por que a Anielle e sua turma optaram por uma ONG internacional para denunciar?
Não se pode condenar um homem por simples desconfiança ou por simples ouvir dizer.
Mais um indício forte de que armaram para o Sílvio Almeida! Até hoje não engoli todas essas denúncias contra ele. Há algo muito errado em tudo isso.
"Na minha opinião, Aniele não está sendo honesta. Toda a atuação dela na política é esquisita."
"Essa ONG tinha que ser investigada também e, conforme for, processada!"
"""Repórter não é juiz. Repórter não é delegado. Repórter não é pra condenar ou inocentar ninguém. O papel do Repórter é apurar os fatos"". Depois dessa eu to seguindo ela no instagram"
"É inocente até que se prove o contrário, Fabíola! Pisou na bola, jornalista!"
"Vergonha alheia da Fabíola. Parabéns, Adriana, pelo trabalho de reportagem!"
"Fica tranquilo, UOL, ele deve ser culpado! Porque segundo a lógica do Josias de Souza (O Especialista em tudo do canal) se o Silvio Almeida não sabe pq alguém mentiria, o Silvio deve ser culpado..."
Intenção era derrubar o ministro.
"Eu não duvido nem por um instante, da inocência do professor Sílvio Almeida. Eu acho que a irmã da Marielle quer se crescer demais às custas da morte da irmã."
"Enquanto não tiverem provas, Sílvio Almeida é inocente. Como tb o prof. Alysson Mascaro."
"QUERO SABER SE A FABIOLA, JOSIAS E SUA TRUPE VÃO PEDIDR DESCULPAS AO SILVIO ALMEIDA CASO ELE SEJA INOCENTADO."
se não apresentou as provas é porque não existem!
Torço muito para que o ex ministro seja inocente. E nesse caso que consiga provar.
Armaram pra cima dele. tô cantando essa pedra desde o começo.
"Sra Fabiola, o ex ministro É sim inocente. Quem tem que provar a sua culpa é o estado"
"Uma vez perguntei pra diretora do Me Too se ela conhecia o trabalho do Mascaro (o maior intelectual brasileiro marxista do pensamento crítico do direito) e ela disse que o achava ""superficial"" foi aí que eu percebi a desonestidade intelectual dela
agora compara o lattes do Mascaro e o dela, vcs vão ver do que falo.
Vejo que uma ala da esquerda quer entrar no Coliseu sem ao menos saber da luta. 
Boa sorte a Ong americana Me Too e a todos os jornalistas liberais."
Eu sempre acreditei na inocência do ministro
"Adriana Negreiros vem dando uma aula de bom Jornalismo, sempre respeitando as Partes envolvidas, bem assim nos Princípios Constitucionais da Ampla Defesa, do Contraditório e da Presunção de Inocência, diferentemente do Senhor Josias e a Senhora Cris que, diuturnamente, insistem em condenar antecipadamente. Uma verdadeira aula de Jornalismo."
Excelente Adriana fazer esse trabalho.Perfeito.Parabens.
"A Fabiola cometeu um erro de comunicação. Ela erra quando fala ""nao quer dizer que ele seja inocente"". Quando o mais coerente, nesse caso, seria dizer ""nao quer dizer que ele seja CULPADO"". Haja vista a presunção de inocência até os fatos julgados."
Só mais um desserviço do fraco jornalista Guilherme Amado... Já não bastasse a vergonha que passou no caso Marcius Melhem.
Aniele Franco já demonstrou ser uma pessoa pouco confiável e pouco competente. Mas só o tempo dirá quem mentiu.
Me parece que a Fabíola já o julgou e o condenou...
"É grave o que fizeram com ele , que a justiça prevaleça"
"Fabíola, enquanto não for julgado, ele é inocente!"
Adriana ensinando a Fabíola a não seguir o método Lava-jato!
Fazeram uma tremenda sacanagem com o ex-ministro Silvio Almeida.
"Acusar é fácil, provar é que é difícil!!!!"
"Da imprensa de direita, claro, não me surpreendi pelas acusações. Mas vi uma grande e imatura ansiedade da imprensa de esquerda e das que fingem neutralidade por acusar Sílvio Almeida, como se fosse uma defesa prévia do próprio trabalho de imprensa dizendo ""a gente não tolera isso de ninguém, não é porque é de alguém de esquerda que vamos passar pano"".
Mas, ao tempo que qualquer desrespeito ou outra forma de agressão contra as mulheres é intolerável, seria tolerável prejudicar a vida de outra pessoa? Quantos prejuízos podem vir desse tipo de acusação? Profissional, familiar, amizades...
Claro que existe assédio, mas também existe calúnia. E agora?
O fato de ser um crime que existe ""aos montes"", covarde porque raramente a vítima tem como provar, não justifica prejudicar a vida do acusado. Que arrumem uma solução sem esse risco, não me perguntem como, não sou jurista nem investigador.
Com tudo isso, não me sinto seguro em defender Sílvio Almeida, mas também não acuso, e, ""in dubio pro reo""."
UMA VERGONHA. IDENTITÁRIOS ATACANDO IDENTITARIOS. PURO OPORTUNISMO.
"Assédio é algo extremamente grave e claro deve ser investigado e quem praticou deve ser punido, mas sempre achei esse caso muito estranho, vamos aguardar."
"A inquisidora Fabiola Cidral ERROU e condenou ao dizer que Silvio Almeida nao e' inocente. Todo acusado e' e inocente e CONTINUA inocente ate' ser provada a culpa. Ate' la', e' inocente sim."
Que repórter incrível! Muito consciente. Parabéns!
Tentaram destruir o cara e a verdade veio a tona.
"'In dúbio pro réu', outro famoso instituto jurídico..."
Essa irmã de Mariele é oportunista e maquiavélica
Tinha que ter vindo do Guilherme Amado.
"A abordagem: Você foi abusada pelo Silvio Almeida?

Muito sério e confiável."
Silvio Almeida foi condenado sumariamente.
Se teve as denuncias feita pra esta ONG tinha que ter registros e relatorios na data da denuncia feita
"Primeiro demite o cara, difama o cara e superempodera a mulher...depois apura..."
Injustiça....
"Madeleine, o fato de mulheres sofrerem abusos não quer dizer que toda denuncia seja verdadeira. Enquanto não se apresentar fatos que corrobore a denuncia, ele é inocente! Que pressa é essa em querer condenar sem provas?"
Estar à frente de uma Ong parece trazer poder e dinheiro.
Se essa denuncia for falsa vai queimar tanto as pautas sobre assédio!
e por que a PF não ouve as vítimas??????
Sabe o que está me parecendo isso tudo? Lawfare.
"O calo da me too é dinheiro e o Silvio pisou nele, a me too gosta é de muita grana para pagar gordos salários a esse bando."
"Dizer que ""isso não significa que ele é inocente"" é muito grave. No Brasil o que há é presunção de inocência. Infelizmente populismo penal também faz parte do campo progressista."
Agora qual a consequência para a elas?!! Acabaram com a vida do cara
"Enquanto a Madalena não condenar o Silvio ela não sossega!!!  Sou mulher,  mas é deprimente certas atitudes feministas!!!!"
"Madeleine bem fraca na defesa das ""vítimas"" sem provas até o presente momento."
"Há criminosos sexuais, bem como há falsas acusações. A fala da Madeleine é absurda! O fato de haver abusadores não torna toda denuncia verdadeira. A falsa acusação tornou-se um modo barato, seguro e eficiente de vingança. É barato porque bastam palavras; é seguro, pois o agressor é tratado como vítima; é eficiente, pois o acusado sofre danos de todos os tipos desde o momento da falsa denúncia."
"Não se acusa alguém sem PROVAS, e é isto que apg fez"
"Desmoralização  do ministro, e o pior é  a desmoralização  de vítimas verdadeiras de outros casos."
"Ou seja, acabaram com a vida do cara sem prova alguma. É f0d4, viu"
imagino o relatório sendo entregue com capa desenhada a mão com canetas coloridas e adesivos brilhantes kkk
Quais os jornalistas e repórteres que farão o mea- culpa e se desculparem em público para o ministro Silvio Almeida?   E a esposa dele? O casamento?  🤦🤦‍♀️
"Esse mee too não ficou satisfeito em acabar com a vida do Silvio, ainda quer ganhar dinheiro. Pense."
Dependendo da imprensa o povo condena antes do julgamento na justiça
"Sinuca: como acusar ou se defender se não se sabe quem, quando ou o quê?...🤔 A PF vai acabar arquivando o inquérito."
As mulheres no BR são livres para denunciar em qualquer delegacia não precisam de ONG mee too...estranho esse caso..
Eu sempre ouvi falar que as delegacias da mulher são exemplares no brasil. Por que precisa de ong então?
"""Precisamos encorpar a denúncia "". O que é isso? Diante disso, qual a veracidade, a confiabilidade dessa ong?"
"Essa história é um escândalo absurdo!
Destruição prévia de um homem que tem carreira séria. 
Essa história tá muito mal comtada."
"Ele já foi condenado sem processo, como muitos. Agora, em investigação da PF a ONG não fornece relatórios oficialmente?"
"Truthfully, after that case, I'm wondering if Cassie was the one who introduced Sean Combs to ""Freak Offs?"" IMO, we've got to return to the days when women were forces to take responsibility for their behavior.  The MeToo Movement has ruined that."
"April you are so interesting to listen to and never seem to fail to see straight to the core of a matter, it's so necessary in these times but I would like to tell you it's so refreshing to see the ways In which you adorn yourself, it's beautiful bringing honor to yourself as well as your husband and family. It has become common to do the opposite today when too many are degrading themselves by their abuse of cosmetics and other trends seemingly totally unaware. It has not always been this way and it's so sad."
From the beginning of this fiasco I had my doubts that Cassie was a victim. Things just don't add up that she is a victim 😮.
These ppl participated period
"It depends on which one you’re referring too. The one that was created to support black eomen who experienced sexual assault, or the Hollywood one meant to silence black women?"
So JLo was  a profesional participent ?
"You have to understand that most of the singers pushed to the forefront today are glorified backup dancers or background singers with good production. Cassie isnt even that. Shes a model who DOES ""singing"". Not a singer. She understood this and made the necessary moves to still make millions. Same as the rappers who needed to be put over. They may have more music talent, but the entertainment industry is all about the gatekeepers putting you on or getting down with a clique."

Et c’est qui qui va sortir la carte de l’antisémitisme ?😂😂😂😂
"Il avait déjà la tête, maintenant il passe pour un"
"Après l'altercation avec Edwy Plenel (très revanchard), j'avoue m'être demandé ce qui allait tomber sur Darmon (comme ce fut le cas pour Elisabeth Badinter). Politis, journal d'extrême gauche, se charge de la sentence. J'aimerais croire ces femmes, mais que des journaux à la gauche de la gauche ne trouvent à incriminer que des personnalités qui ne s'affichent pas ""engagées"", ou ont une liberté de ton, ça revient à faire de la presse un outil de mise au pas et de règlement de compte. C'est assez puant. Le totalitarisme ne s'y prend pas autrement. Décidément, cette période est vraiment inquiétante.
(PS : Politis est le journal dont le rédac-chef est père d'Ersilia Soudais et ami de J.L. Mélenchon ; pour info, concrète celle-ci)"

Bravo à cette actrices pour son argumentation très intéressante
Cest bien de prendre la parole pour toutes les victimes et d'expliquer les choses merci ❤
Bravo
"Sara nous explique très bien ce qu'elle a vécu et ce qui se passe trop souvent, effectivement ceux qui ont été témoins et qui n'ont rien dit agissent comme des complices, ils doivent rendre des comptes !!"
Je suis surtout d'accord sur la neutralisation des complices.... les journalistes faux-jeton notamment.
Très bonne actrice. Tout mon soutien 🍀💫🌟
Talentueuse et vraie.
"Je suis pas étonnée dans les milieux fermés avec des grosses sommes d'argent c'est certain qu'on faisait taire je l'ai vécu je l'ai connu  dans d'autres milieux et oui ça se passait ainsi. Mais c'est bien on avance, de toute facon se taire a un prix un poids de culpabilité et de conscience c'est horrible. Donc autant parler et il y a aussi un prix  tout combat même petit a un prix. Mais cest commme ça que ca avance que ca change. Le mot, la parole, est importante tout le monde n'a pas cette chance d'être écouté à travers un média. Et tout ça là c'est la voix de toutes les agressés, j'ai subi aussi jeune et je sais ce que c'est, et je me suis tue car j'avais personne et je savais que plus ces agressions javais pas l'énergie de subir plus car le pognon ou moi j'étais rien c'est une bataille donc force a tout ça vraiment."
Le Spectacle est visiblement peuplé de gens détraqués mais c'est logique.
Exactement .....
Pauvre Sara Forestier qui s est fait humilier

Je ne suis qu'une femme lambda pas du tout dans un milieu artistique mais je me retrouve dans leurs mots et leurs combats 💪✊❤"
"Il y a une question qui me tracasse. Est-ce que le mouvement Me Too arrivera à changer le regard sur le corps de la femme qui la réduit à une marchandise exploitée par plusieurs arts visuels (revues, clips musicaux, télévision, cinéma…). C’est une marchandisation qui rapporte beaucoup d’argent et il faut dire que beaucoup de femmes sont elles-mêmes promotrices souvent inconscientes de ce système qui leur permet de connaître parfois succès et richesse. Est-ce que le véritable aboutissement du Me Too ne passe pas aussi par une démarche de courage des femmes pour désormais refuser de fonder leur succès et leur richesse sur cette marchandisation? Car ceux qui sont au sommet de ce système auront toujours tendance à considérer qu’ils ont des droits sur les « biens » qu’ils achètent. Je pose les questions. Je ne prétends pas avoir les bonnes réponses."
"Le cinéma français est un milieu bourgeois où ceux qui tiennent les rennes évoluent parmi les journalistes, les politiques, et leurs enfants.. Ce n’est rien de plus qu’une transposition d’un système féodal, qu’une bourgeoisie omnisciente perpétue. Les violences sont là, prêtes à germer, car le pouvoir n’a pas de contradicteur , lorsqu’il y en a un, il est évincé. Quant à la législation sur le travail, régie, décoration, production regorgent d’illégalités au code du travail. Tout ce monde le sait, les milieux artistiques sont des microcosmes de société, l’expérience peut être inoubliable… ou votre pire cauchemar. Attention aux enfants, la DASS devrait intensifier ses visites sur les plateaux, ce sont les premières victimes !"

"Now that Malayalam industry has started this, I hope other industries too follow the same"
Palki as far as I know AMMA is not state run.  It is an organization started by the malayalam film actors for the welfare of both the actors and actresses but it is very clear it's for these hooligans and not for any woman. The state run  is the film academy.
"For those of who are saying that Mollywood is shameful, Keralites are shameful let me ask u, u guys think these kind of things happen only in Mollywood?? It’s everywhere !! Now Mollywood is on focus because  their actresses showed courage to come out n speak and unlike what happened in Bollywood many big actors like Prithviraj,Jagadeesh coming forward in their support, even the audience majority of them are standing with the victim, the revolution is big enough the entire members of executive board in AMMA resigned, I hope every other industry take it an example"
So proud of the Hema committee for putting this through. This will cause some birthing pains but it will help woman all over India to bring up a new standard. Malayalee people telling the truth and taking responsibility. So proud of the Malayalee people for taking this bold step. Every industry should learn.
"It’s not a meToo movement, we already had a meToo movement just like everyone else. This is start of a new movement."
Salute Kerala for bring this out… imagine if this will happen in another 100 years in Bollywood… Kerala always leads the race
"On a serious note, if entertainers can have a sense of decency to resign at the first instance of accusations, when will our elected representatives in parliament show this level of decency in the face of greater accusations and resign?"
This should continue across the industry
"1:19 AMMA is not a state-run body ,it is an association of Malayalam movie artists. It is run by these movie artists.  Kerala state government has no role in the functioning of AMMA."
To anyone still defending these actors.. I hope you open your eyes one day
"I think every film industry will have such things, it is just a matter of time to get exposed."
This is just a beginning in the Indian Film Industry…
"Kerala always lead,others should follow"
"Glad Palki is reporting on this issue. But some serious errors noticed. AMMA is not a state body. This was started as a collective by few actors and grew into a larger association over the years. The government kept the report under the wraps for over 4 years without publishing. Eventually published when courts and others got involved and forced them. Even now some parts as not published. Also, the graphics and in the beginning part of the video is very misleading. I regularly watch this channel. I have noticed some major reporting errors when Palki talks about American politics and election campaign going on now. I am a Malayali who lives in US. Now I am wondering how much of the things I hear here about other areas that I am not familiar with is true or false. I still like this channels compared to most others out there. Hope Palki's team will strive to be more truthful."
its not 4 days but 4 yrs they did not release the Justice Hema report!
I always thought Palkis information was right but now I doubt! Always don’t portray this issue as something that happens only in Kerala! U should have given a wider perspective!
Very soon every other Film industry is gonna go through this same issue. Hope Judicial system is gonna take appropriate steps
"One of the rare occasions where you disappointed me, Palki. You say you have been tracking this story from day 1, but it seems no proper work has gone behind your/your team's research. How can you make such basic mistakes? AMMA is an association of Malayalam movie artists. It is not a state-run body. They did not sit on the report, the government sat on it for 5 years. The movies made over 1000 crores in the first quarter, not 100,000 crores as you said. And the current allegations from women have nothing to do with the report. It's so messed up that the perpetrators will escape and the good ones will eventually spoil their names."
AMMA is not state run...it's a private body!
"Miss Kerala ex-winners died in a mysterious car accident incident and some celebrities and high profile figures were involved, nobody talks about it anymore!"
Now Keralalites have shown the way in bringing out the truth..Will other states follow..?
"This is not a mee too palki. .To all those people who doesn't know. Hema committee, which is under Retd judge of kerala high court Hema madam which is commissioned by kerala government as an aftermath of the sexual assault case of an actress  in  2017 ,  its only formed in 2017, doesn't mean it was started working it was on paper, and there after she took 2 years for study ( including all film lightboy to actors to directors)  and  report framed as per the standards of reports. These are allegations , so to avoid defamation , they are curated , which is the proceeding of the law in this country. And there is a 7 member investigation team by ips officee including 4 females, now the victims have to comeforward and give case.  And amma is an actors federation not any state run, because palki said so."
1:45 It was the Kerala government sat on the report not AMMA
"The movement brought by the women in the film industry in Kerala will be done in other industries.. They deserve to be congratulated. Especially in the current situation in India.

￼"
Now you know the reason why they say Kerala is educated? At least the women artists from Mollywood have the guts to come forward and form a committee. Who knows what's happening in the media world
Kerala is like Japan. Society is so rotten on the inside but everyone tries to paint everything so nice that an outsider would always see it like a wonder.
If such a report comes in Bollywood ☠️ not only women there will be exploited men as well !!
Just have a committee in Telugu anr Tamil  snd Kannada and Bollywood you be even more surprised
What started in Bollywood was me too movement. Is there a WCC equivalent...an organization by women actors? Did the state govt work on a committe like the Hema report?
"In India, Labour laws don't apply to the film industry. Bollywood is the best example.
Unfortunately none of the government is keen to reform film,  entertainment & fashion industry"
I hope mollywood becomes safe and respectable place to work for women.
The interesting fact is that there has been no response from artists from any other Indian film industry - just wondering why..😂😂😂
Kerala has set a precedent by being the first state to openly confront this problem within its film industry. I hope this will inspire other regions to conduct their own investigations and contribute to a healthier and safer working environment for all.
Thanks so much for not sidelining the news of Kerala thanksssss❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ incredibly great ful coz PPL should discuss this.....this topic is not getting enough attention from north
"Not just Mohanlal, every executive members resigned."
Malayalam Industry leading by example. All the other film industries need to retrospect as well.
Im digressing here but can we appreciate the news reporter for her absolutely beautiful way of speaking. Love watching her speak
"One thing i deny Palki is, she is trying to generalize things here."
"It's a shame and I had recently watched a couple of movies based on liberal, socialist themes. Well, unfortunately in India the left liberal gangs are way too active. If a person like the UP chief minister Shri Yogi Adithyanath has a solution, they protest b**chch and moan about him being cruel, on the other hand they go on a propaganda saying women are not safe... specially blaming Modi Ji. This state is not run by BJP otherwise there could have been a lot going on internationally, from BBC to Al jazeera."
"Me too has to come to Tolloywood and get the truth about heroes, Directors and producers."
"But years later still no report, news section from you on misuse of section 498A..
Nothing nil...
 showing only one side problem.. Instead of ground level real life treating issues faced by good men's..

Great journalism.. 👍👍"
I hope the rest of the country finds courage to expose the bad apples too.
"Atleast some committee is there speaking about this issue in Kerala. Other state governments , police, & courts sitting silently like they don't know what's casting couch & like it never happened or happening in the film industries of those states.
Many actresses & actors talked about this happenings in other film industries but no state or central government reacted on these issues."
Why only film industry is coming out in this Me Too campaign where often the body contact of male n female is called as Acting ? 😂
"AMMA is not a state run body it's a private body, just and association of actors"
"Hope these investigations bring back the focus on bollywood. So many deaths, drugs, trafficking and rumours of the casting couch, but nothing happened."
Kudos to all actress 👏👏👏👏👏👏
"Palki..This sure is story line in the entertainment industry..allover India or rather world over.
Hats off to hema committee and the Malayalam actresses who dared the devil's"
"Stop calling it MeToo, this predates the MeToo movement! And for the love of all things good, stop calling it Mollywood 🤢. Nobody calls it that here in Kerala. Malayalam Cinema will do."
"Great work to the Malayalam movie industry apart from making great movies ,Now, for taking action before other Indian states. Also kudos to AMMA office bearers to step down on moral grounds !"
The irony of the situation is only because it is Kerala the world will know about this..I can bet that it is worse in every other Indian film industry but sadly no one will be the wiser…
Malayalam actress had the courage while others dont have..tats it..
Even firstpost took it upon to clean swipe  AMMA😂😂😂what a shame for us  keralites
"They disgraced the the noble term ""a.m.m.a."" !😂"
Sexual predators abound in Molywood. It has been there since the beginning..Now the stink has come out. Hopefully this  will be a new beginning.
He is the Main Culprit
"Can we keep this rolling , have a committee in other film industry too 😁"
"All this is there in every workplace-- even in old times-- but then things were not as complex as they are now--- even in buses , trains and walking on the road  these things do happen.As long as the world is there sexuality will exist"
"It's KERALA. That's why the news is coming out. Because the audience itself is much more self aware and has higher social standards and morals. For Tamil, Telugu or Bollywood such revelations will take 200 years. Just like everything else Malayalam is going to be the starting point of cleansing this misogyny too. :)"
But why Mohanlal resigned if he is clean.  He should speak out and come clean
"palki is misleading people by saying ""Amma "" is a state run, because of her hatrid she haven't followed the facts this time😂😂😂."
This should put up a pathway for similar movements to reveal what’s going on in other film industries in the nation . It’s a shame indeed .
I’m starting to doubt her credibility as more and more videos come out where she is seen speaking half the truth or just blatantly categorizing
"It's not just the ""me too"" stories that have been dugged out. Some of these actors/actresses are even pointing out the existence of an upper caste lobby in the malayalam industry. Palki will never utter a word on it. The rest of ""Palki"" and her politics says the reason."
As a Bangladeshi its very common every Where.. I didn’t expect from kerala 💔💔 i really feel bad..huge fan of Malayalam Movies
Hema Committee Report shows The Real Kerala Story
Heard it a raging topic among all❤❤🎉🎉
Mr Mohan Lal acting masterbution during film fare function for that mummutti and other actors mimicking for his act
"No other film industry or state gvmt in India will have the courage to set us such a judicial committee to enquire about the exploitations among top influential  actors. Exploitations happen across all industries, but the backbone to identify, acknowledge and take right judicial steps biaslessly to correct the problem, is unique to Kerala. Thats because people are informed and their rational thinking is beyond hero worshiping. More power to people 👍"
Ask Mohanlal why he is resigned ?
Its been like this for a long time good its out now
Imagine going to a corporate company for an interview and the interviewer says if you adjust you will get job. There will be huge uproar. Art is also same but the industry operates it differently. There are no contracts for junior artist or technicians sometimes. An office boy in corporate will have contract but not in cine industry. There should be some kind of strict audit and law.
Good job ..
Pretty sure there are darker and sinister stuff happening behind the screen
Palki thinks she knows everything. She is just another loud mouth who does anything for popularity 😅
this is an offline video and in that she said hundred thousand crores instead 1000 cr . They didnt edited or reshooted. just released the false information
How they have not learned from the MeToo movement in America is beyond me. Why would the continue to still do such a horrible thing
"This is a movement to malign south indian film industry, specifically Malayalam Film Industry, by the rivals. Malyalam artists are decent people.  These incidents are much more in Bollywood than all of South India combined. Yet no one talks. . They cant stand South Indian/Malayalam movies doing so well across India/globe. Shameful!!"
Awesome presentation ❤
It’s the follow-up which is more important. The sexual predators must be punished so that it doesnt happen to anybody else. What happened to singer/dubbing artist Chinmayi shouldnt happen to any other victim/survivor. Chinmayi accused Tamil lyricist Vairamuthu of sexual misconduct during the metoo movement . Since then Chinmayi has  been officially banned from dubbing work in Tamil film industry until now. Vairamuthu didnt suffer any penalty
A m m a is not state run..please Correct it
"The headline is misleading. The executive committee was dissolved including President and Secretary. When you point out Mohanlal's name some may interpret it as he also is facing allegation. He resigned his post as President taking moral responsibility. 
So the headline should have been executive committee dissolved including President , rather than Mohanlal resigned due to #Me too"
"Resigns say it all!! 
Such a shame of so-called educated state."
"When is Bollywood going to publish  their ""Hema report""?"
"This wont finish with this , the accused and the hiding ones will be caught and they will be forced to answer .  people will not allow this to over just like that .  with this hope other industries will also wake up ."
CBI must investigate
"While saying that we live in the 21st century  , not only in the film industry do things like this happen , it happens in every industry , politics , sports , name it and this sexual harrasment occurs . Saw one clip where Adv. Kapil Sibal walks into a room where there was a gathering of senior lawyers and one senior lawyer was busy on his phone . Sibil was greeted but he was not very pleased on seeing the seated advocate . The clip shows an advocate telling the seated advocate to stand up and pay respect . Is this hierarchy ."
It is not a state run body. Its a body made by the malayalam artists themselves for the welfare of the industry and its members. Moreover he resigned now so he is not obliged to speak or comment whatever the media wants. We don't know who are the real culprits and the real abusers until then rather than blaming everyone the people should wait for the report and the court verdict.
"So many heroine have been taken on faily basis by so called mohanlal and Mam hotty 
Honey rose 
Rasmika 
Nayantara 
Tapase 
Eliana 
The list is big 
Its same in bollywood and hollywood 
So no difference 
Few days drama then new heroines will come and join the industry for money name all will enjoy like before"
"They should be arrested...why partiality.. Consensual Rape happened.. where is Court,.. Indian power group can do anything...shame to Indian parliament..."
So sad. Such hypocrites. I can’t watch Malayali movies in the same light anymore
"Nothing ain't gonna happen, these actors have huge fan following in Kerala,"
"Who are these 10-15 men?
Please mention their names"
It gonna remain the same until women produce or people would like to watch women star centric movies..
Stop making the internal power dynamics of the Malayalam film industry as some grave national issue.
Change your title… it’s misleading
Even hollywood has the same....every film industry shud be  under scanner...but i dnt think that media wud take it forward in the same way that kerala media has taken it
"@firstpost - AMMA is a private association founded by bigwigs. Not a state run association. Not everyone are accused as claimed to be. A handful, less than 10 folks and two of them are powerful. Mohanlal himself has not been accused, rather he resigned being the president of the actors body. Facts and news are way off on this one."
It's not state run association!
4:01 A hundred thousand crore!!!
😂😂😂😂😂
En toute impunité pas sans 😉

"不是直接開除,你三粒該倒"
拒看三粒！
是性侵不是性騷
"算了吧 ！黑人 黃子佼 NONO 這些人最後都收到什麼懲罰？！
像我這種沒背景的 被打還手可能都要被關"
幫自家人馬賽克??怎麼不見幫柯還是其他人馬賽克呢?
辦去來，有犯罪就抓去關。
三立敢對江祖平怎樣，大家拒看三立。
三立最愛這一味～
"在茶水間貼標語有啥鳥用？？
貼副總辦公室門口比較實在吧  笑死"
"我擔心在三立工作的女性朋友，是否還有性騷事件未爆出！
畢竟這種事情發生在高層！
如果三立內部還有女性受到不平等待遇性騷！應該要勇敢站出來！
支持性騷零容忍！"
暫離現職啥意思
綠色媒體跟政客...........唉~~~~道德低落~~~
別怕~三立有黨政的
這新聞看起來不像護短😂
牛逼，下藥性侵，說交往。
正式改名兩粒電視台
真的希望政黨輪替，讓三立獲得應有的處理😂
喔是喔 呵呵
這種行為絕不能因為當事人有背景就低調處理，三立作為台灣人抵抗共產主義的輿論防線，更應該 用公正的態度處理此事。
三立演員不知還有沒有受害者⋯⋯
"怎麼三立對於江祖平的新聞都只報導三立的聲明稿而已,其他的都不報!"
"不護短？😏
因為與政治無關所以沒差？😏"
都已經要調查了還有人在酸
J'ai toujours aimé le bon sens de Kévin Razy.
"MERCI! C'est important d'appuyer le point essentiel et d'oser exprimer ton opinion. Je ne fais pas partie des femmes concernées par cette affaire mais j'ai fait partie de ces femmes, nombreuses, pour qui la justice n'a rien fait. Moins de 1% des plaintes pour violences sexistes et sexuelles   mènent à une sanction pénale. Et encore! Encore faut-il que la plainte soit prise par la police... Pour ma part, il y a des années j'ai poussé la porte du commissariat en tremblant, ai vécu un moment horriblement malaisant sur place et suis repartie sans qu'on ait pris ma plainte, davantage traumatisée qu'en y rentrant. 
Alors oui, quand la justice fera son travail, on n'aura plus à faire justice soi-même. Mais bon, avec des hommes pareils à la tête de notre gouvernement, corrompus et/ou complices de ce genre de délits, on a bien compris qu'on ne pouvait pas compter sur nos institutions par les temps qui courent! A nous de faire bouger les choses! Alors ce genre de prise de parole comme la tienne, ça compte dans la balance et ça fait chaud au coeur ."
L'affaire Théo en dit long
"Bon, déjà force aux victimes. Peu importe tout le bullshit que l'on raconte on doit commencer et finir par ça, c'est le plus important.

Ensuite ben.. C'est compliqué..

C'est compliqué et effectivement tout les problèmes découlent en réalité d'un seul problème qui est la façon dont sont traité les victimes aussi bien par la police que par la justice.

Si la police et la justice ferait leur travail correctement on en serait pas là à devoir juger, à devoir douter, à se demander si l'on pense correctement ou pas et à culpabiliser de ne pas savoir.

Donc ça c'est vraiment la chose qui doit changer en priorité et très rapidement parce que du coup personnellement à mon niveau de personne lambda, même si pour ce qui est de l'affaire Seb Mellia j'imagine que Florence Mendez est suffisament intelligente pour savoir d'où proviennent ses témoignages et que, ce milieux n'étant pas non plus si grand, la place au doute est quasi-nulle, ben concretement il ne me reste plus qu'à croire aveuglément une seule personne qui porte la parole de 20 autres sans avoir la moindre preuves de quoi que ce soit ou, si j'émet l'idée que j'ai pas envie de croire quelqu'un aveuglément, passer pour un salaud tout ça à cause d'une poignée de fonctionnaires et de magistrats incompétents/aux valeurs louches/dangereux.

Tout comme je pense que se faire justice soi-même n'est pas une solution mais dans ce contexte encore une fois emettre cet argument c'est prendre le risque de passer pour une raclure.

Alors est-ce qu'il y aurai pas d'autres méthodes pour faire en sorte que la parole des victimes soit réellement prises en compte par exemple via des associations qui auraient plus de poid ? Je sais pas et puis on ne devrai même pas avoir à se poser ce genre de question.

Encore une fois que ce soit au niveau de la police ou de la justice il faut vraiment que ca bouge parce que même si on met un stop à la carrière d'un violeur et qu'on informe le publique sur ses crimes c'est peut-être toujours mieux que rien mais sans condamnation ce ne sera toujours qu'une demi sanction.

Il faut que les vieilles mentalités masculinistes/patriarcales/malsaines au sein de la police et de la justice soit éradiquées une bonne foi pour toute parce que les _""vous êtes sûr que vous ne l'avez pas un peu cherché ?""_ les _""vous étiez habillé comment ?""_ et la complaisance parce que _""il a du talent""_ ou même simplement _""il est célebre""_ c'est juste plus possible (sans parler de la corruption pure et simple).

Bref. Il faut que ça bouge.

Fait chier.. Et forces aux victimes."
Il est Ayatollah maintenant Kevin Nazi?
Il est tout seul la ?
"Kevin Razy toujours là à donner des leçons... Il fera moins le malin quand il se retrouvera avec des plaintes de meufs sorties de nulle part qui l’accuseront des pires choses juste parce qu’il est connu.

Présomption d’innocence. 
Qu’elles aillent porter plainte, et qu’on laisse la justice faire son travail plutôt que de prendre le risque de briser la vie perso et pro de quelqu’un en se basant sur des rumeurs."
Ca arrive que à des mecs blindé d'oseille... Bizarre non?
Cest une dénonciation calomnieuse pas de la diffamation il y a des femmes aui ce servent de ça pour régler des comptes. Ca mest arrivé et cest vraiment pas drole car cest une insulte aux vrais victimes.....
Pauvre tâche vendue 🫡🇫🇷🇷🇺😎
"Merci d'avoir parler de ce sujet tabou, sans déshumanisé personne,"
"Sujet courageux sur Mediapart. Bravo. Toute violence est à dénoncer, Chahinez, Shaina,  victimes de soit disant codes d'honneur, dans lequel la femme appartiendrait aux hommes  ."
"Merci Mediapart ❤
Bravo et merci à ces deux hommes d'avoir pris parti contre les VSS.
Espérons que cette histoire n'apporte pas trop d'eau au moulin du RN."
Il était temps que ça sorte. Bravo pour votre éthique et impartialité.
"Pas qu'une priorité, c'est principal et pas un scandale, on a aucun problème à dévoiler les fauteurs de trouble et on y encourage même, ça ne remettra pas en cause notre système religieux et ne fera que nettoyer de notre système les hypocrites, que les détracteurs ou malsains d'esprit restent à leur place"
"Pourquoi ces individus sont encore sur le sol français !
Les lanceurs d'alertes derangent ?"
"Pédophilie aussi, se croire à l'abri c'est mettre en danger les enfants. Ceux-ci perçoivent très bien que la peur du scandale sera trop forte, qu'on ne les croira pas et qu'il vaut mieux qu'ils se taise, exactement comme les enfants de confession catholique dans les années 50. Elle est où la priorité ?"
Merci mediapart
Ça salit et à la fin ça ose dire qu'ils sont innocents à l'heure d'aujourd'hui
"C’est très bien de dénoncer - merci de relayer. Par ailleurs, je pense que la nomination du mouvement « me too islam »est mal choisie car elle ouvre la porte à de nombreux amalgames dont souffrent déjà beaucoup les musulmans. « Me too imam » serait bien plus approprié je pense. D’ailleurs, avez t’on parlé de « me too catholicisme ou Chretien »? Il s’agissait d’un « me too église » :)
Je fais suffisamment confiance à mediapart pour penser que c’est une maladresse qui j’espère sera corrigé :) 
Bravo de continuer à dénoncer encore et toujours quelque soit les milieux! Merci pour le vrai travail de journalisme"
Merci d'en parler.
C'est pas trop tôt..enfin une indignation non sélective.
f/licitation pour votre prise de recul
Cela existe depuis longtemps....notamment dans ce qu'on appel les écoles coranique.
"Se sont des hommes qui sont jugés,pourquoi ajouter une dimension religieuse,c'est un problème qui concerne tous le monde,vous associé encore l'islam dans un problème de société."
Le gros souci c'est que ces violences sont légitimées par les textes islamiques. Creusez de ce côté !
"Le féminisme est incompatible avec l'islam 
Je ne parle pas de certains Haddith qui sont juste horrible à lire, parce qu'ils divisent au sein des différentes communautés 
Parlons du Saint Coran, lisez toutes les sourates du chapitre sur les femmes, c'est magnifique à lire
Le Coran est accessible gratuitement sur le net, en quelques clics vous pouvez lire quelques sourates"
"Mais mdr ces gens là ne représentent aucunement l’islam. 
Ils utilisent peut-être hypocritement l’islam pour arriver à leur fin mais ce genre de comportement n’e iste pas seulement dans les religions mais dans tout les secteurs d’activités (acteur, actrice, monde professionnel etc.)."
Les féministes qui ont toujours raison on en  marre.
"Pour avoir suivi l'affaire de près à l'époque je peux vous dire que ça n'a ni queue ni tête et honnêtement même si cela était vrai on peut pas du tout qualifier les faits de VSS. De plus le personnage de Amin qui est un très jeune influenceur sur un sujet qu'il ne maitrise pas (l'islam) n'est pas très fiable. Il s'est beaucoup contredit et on sent que c'est une personne qui est en quête de gloire à travers le contenu qu'il a partagé sur tiktok.
J'avoue être un peu déçu du traitement des ces questions par Mediapart comme pour les questions sur l'énergie où on sent un dogmatisme.
J'espère au moins que vous donnerez le contradictoire aux personnes accusées."
"Astérix et Obélix, Dupon et Dupont, Mario et Luigi, Mediapart et la diffamation.."
Metooislam ? L’islam pose un pb ou certains hommes d’origine arabe ? L’islam ne prône ni sexisme ni misogynie contrairement à ce que la caste politique française tente d’inoculer à travers ses lois et les médias. N’amalgamez pas de potentiels délinquants avec l’islam . L’église a couvert ses prêtres mais l’islam n’a pas de clergé donc n’écrivez pas n’importe quoi
Regardez casus et jack le fou
"Et voilà... islam.... pour que l'algorithme fasse son travail...
Un autre nom aurait été bienvenu,"
Bin voyons
"Nul ! Vous precisez à la fin que ces personnes sont présumé innocente donc video inutile

Me too ""Islam ""🤦‍♀️ il y a que vous pour vous salir toute une religon.
Il y a eu des histoire de pédophilie dans les église et JAMAIS il n'y a eu un me too christianisme !! On ne sali pas toute une religion pour le mal de quelque personne. Si ce sont des imams que vous visez, notez plutôt me too imam ou autre. 
Mais bon vous savez tres bien ce que vous faites .
Je ne souhaite pas longue vie à votre chaine ..."
Momo
Propagande
"C'est reparti...on vient encore taper sur les musulmans comme s'il n'y avait pas assez de cas ailleurs, comme le cinéma, les journalistes, etc.
Est ce que PPDA est en prison ? Non...
Est ce que Depardieu est en prison ? Non...
Mais on attaqué Tariq Ramadan malgré la dernière décision de justice en Suisse mais bizarrement personne ne parle de cette décision en France.
Toujours pareil...même Mediapart maintenant 😢"
