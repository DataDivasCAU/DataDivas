Don't apologize to these witches. You stand your ground. He was absolutely correct. He didn't hurt a soul.
"Sounds like Tony meant what he said, but apologized to cover his ASS. He was being an adult BULLY to that woman who had the courage to SPEAK UP to him."
"Exposing a perpetrator empowers one, that takes courage, helps protect others and is down right heroic. Remaining silent, that’s a right...because of fear, because of PTSD, and other issues."
men are losing their careers without due process. just because she says it where is the evidence.
He was right this is why causes become cultish
Stand your ground Tony. You were correct. Don't back down to these movements.
Damn I am a girl. I am so disrespected!

"Rapist will come out and try to defend themselves and their fellow brotheren with many reasons but it only make them look guilty, like that show when they caught them with cameras trying to pick up kids for sex.   Compare his demeanor to one of those rapist who think they can get away with  rape, murder etc 

I see a rapist"
Tony is a bad man
https://youtu.be/Ui3S-ZlIDp4?si=D43uzuqSTniHq44-
Tony Was right. Stop crying
men are losing their careers without due process. just because she says it where is the evidence.
"Many men are fed up with all the ""rules"" and are simply opting not to talk to women at all."
Men are not “scared” or “intimidated”.   We have observed the minefield and chose a path to avoid it entirely.  We are walking away….
"MeToo didn't destroy men.
It woke us up"
"Dont say anything at all, just ignore women, full stop."
"Ironically, the MeToo movement has become the very harassment that it claims to fight."
"So called ""strong women"" are threatened by compliments."
"Stop complimenting women, easy."
Chivalry is dead….you women killed it.
Every guy I know young or old is absolutely done with women! WAY too much hassle. NOT WORTH IT!!!!!
The feminist movement destroyed men long before the Me Too movement came along.
"Women actually destroyed the workplace the moment they joined it. 

Everything is like walking on eggshells, just waiting for this highly emotional being to find any reason to tick off."
The women complaining about men giving compliments are the ones who are jealous because they don’t get any.
We’re also sick of being treated as expendable.
"The same women will make reels and tick tocks asking, 
"" Why don't men approach me in public? "" 
"" Where are all the good men?"" 
"" Why don't men include me in social circles at work?"" 
"" Dating culture is dead in Australia."""
The reason why hr exists is because of women. No hr on the building sites i work on
"""Me too"" was a wake up call for men."
"I refuse to even make eye contact with them on the street at this point. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
"I avoid all vvomen as much as humanly possible. I'm happy with that, and I am sure they are too. The peace is extraordinary."
"The world is falling apart because men like me just went “alright” and let the women take charge. Are things better? Do you feel safer? Are you happy, now?"
"Just like modern feminism. It's not about fundamental rights anymore, but about how much you can get by complaining and playing the victim."
"Men just switched off, and women are noticing it. Most guys will only go out of their way to interact and help out a small number of women who are related to them. Helping out female strangers? Not worth the risk."
Ignore women… period.
"It’s not the me too movement. It’s that modern women are entitled, have internalized a lot of negative beliefs about men, and don’t feel like they need to offer anything to the relationship. No thanks"
"The last time I gave a female co worker a compliment I got called up to HR and they said I apparently made an ""inappropriate remark"". They warned me not to do it again and now I avoid her like the plague. All I said to her was that she looked nice that day because I could tell she put effort into her hair and makeup before work, wasn't even flirting for real as I knew she had a longterm boyfriend.
Never doing that again. Just don't do it fellas."
"Thank you for the compliment. I'm one of the good guys who left the dating scene years ago. When I was still working it got to the point I never talked to women. I went MGTOW to protect myself, my peace and to stay safe."
"It's incredibly patronising to be told what you can and can not say as adults and professionals. Treating men like children is commonplace now. Seriously, how did we get here."
I wouldn’t say destroyed- I would say it made us all see the light.
It destroyed relationship dynamics and also promoted false victims meanwhile the actual victims are drowned out.  Men adapted as we always do.
The same comment from a Chad will elicit a totally different reaction than from an unattractive man----possibly a call to HR.
So MEN's speech is being policed. Shocker.
Men are fed up with the overreach and the planned destruction of men by the people behind this movement.
"""Fuckable"" was not on the list though, so maybe they could say it."
"if i spent that much money on a ticket just to be told my speech is to be policed, i'd demand a refund of 200% for every man there, and then have us all leave."
It hasn't destroyed men. It has shown them who women really are.
HR isn’t a necessary part of a company
"The biggest problem is that the men who actually have good intentions and respect women listened and did what they said, they stopped approaching or even talking to you at all. The creeps who want to take advantage of women already didn't care if what they were doing was wrong, and so they continued on as usual. So all you achieved was removing any good men from the equation. Funny how the bullies never had trouble getting dates, the abusers, the criminals, never known any of them to struggle with women. Good men who respect and care about women? They mostly die alone after a life of being invisible. Why are we shocked when the younger generations are following Tate etc when all they ever see are good men suffering and bad men winning?"
I live by one rule. Never compliment a woman ever!
"I have not complimented a woman in years. Frankly, I don't care anymore."
"""You're so beautiful"" does come across as cringe, especially in 2025. Gentlemen, don't do it. Treat them like men."
"It didn’t destroy men. It just changed them to consider life without women, and for the most part it’s a positive experience."
"There’s an old saying: least said, soonest mended.  When in doubt, hold your tongue.  Silence may be misunderstood, but it can never be misquoted."
"In a work environment, always compliment with ""You look almost competent"" instead of ""You look sexy."""
It has freed a lot of men from devorce rape and false allegations ❤
I'd ask for a refund right there. Give me my $500 dollars back and I'll spend my time doing something else.
I just married a woman from a non Western culture. I don't need to ask her what she brings to the table. I don't need to ask what I get back for all the energy I put in. It's obvious.
"""destroyed"" = set them free 😂😂😂😂"
Don't blame metoo. Blame the women who joined it or promoted it AND the women who were sucked into believing it.
Enjoy your career in 'cybersecurity.' The jeets will have your jobs in short order.
Gender policing is descrimination. Do not participate in such misandry.
Construction workers need a massive pay rise. That'd save a lot of men
"Anything bad that has happened to women at miscellaneous moments in history will pale in comparison to the catastrophic mistake of MeToo.

Women didn’t just screw men over during that movement, women screwed themselves, each other, their daughters, younger sisters; anyone that now has to navigate the world today post MeToo. 

Most men and women are alone now because for men, it’s not worth risking their lives and reputations on speaking to, approaching or associating with the wrong woman.

It’s over and there no going back now."
And women wonder why men stopped even approaching them at all.
"One of the reasons I gave up romance and I know I am not the only one to do so. Women want to be left alone, they got their wish."
"🤷‍♂️ Gentlemen, simply walk away. I can assure you, your silence will be greater than any “offensive compliment” a woman has ever received."
"Giving power to those who have no loyalty, wisdom, conscience, or morals invites chaos. 

These women will be in a bad mood and will destroy a man based on accusation alone. 

And look at the results- more enmity."
"They basicly ban the legit compliments ...
Did they hand notes to women ?

God, lately I do regret being part of this mankind ..."
I worked in and office and women would ask me from time to time what I thought of their outfits. I refused to answer.
"The ""MeToo"" movement has left women single for life.
Men are not destroyed, they are doing their own thing without women.
Bye, bye ladies."
"The ""metoo"" movement hasn't made any impression on me, I can assure you Danica😂😂😂😂"
"You can just take out the space between ‘In’ and ‘Security’, and it works perfectly."
"Most women think this is fixable,
They are wrong, 
They are starting to see that men are not scared,
WE ARE DONE, 
AND DONE MEANS PERMANENTLY DONE."
"2017 August lost job because a female and outsourced workers claimed I exposed myself, multiple cameras displayed the true testament, yet I was the one in the wrong...""me too"" can lay in the bed it's created, made an indefinite enemy."
The women insecurity award. That would be a tough battle.
I like how they only handed these to men. As if women can't possibly be creepy and innapropriate at a workplace.
"No, no, it set men free, best thing that ever happened"
"As a man cruising into middle age i have mates who are single / divorced. They now refuse to date because its too dangerous. They live in fear of slander and false accusation. One has admitted to me he plans to be celibate and die alone, numerous dates with all kinds of women they no longer ask about work, taste in music etc but from 1st minute of sitting down cross examine him on polical views. He told me when he realised he was trying to get a table with plenty of cctv on him he just went stuff it, ill stay hm."
"$500 per ticket - nice.
Women need their own award ceremony - great.
Being told how to speak - fabulous."
"""MeToo"" didn't destroy men at all.  To most men it restored (or should have restored) knowledge they should have known from childhood regarding the realities of women's nature and behavior.  It demonstrated very loudly what women naturally are.  It reminded us of what societies throughout human history inherently knew but our society somehow forgot.   If anything, ""MeToo"" returned men's regard of women back in line with nature and objective reality.  Men's behavior toward women now is the natural response to these women's natural behaviors.  This is why societies worldwide throughout history managed women they way they did.  If they didn't, this happened and the society collapsed.   Organize your regard for women and your behavior with women by what women naturally do and how they regard you and treat you when free to do so, observe what is happening now -- let that be your teacher and guide.  This is what women really are.  Plan and respond accordingly."
"Glad that
1) I wouldn't go to an event like this
2) I never compliment women I don't know"
"I read through a couple of hundred comments here, not a single one from a woman. That's very telling."
"The women's movement won the battle, but lost the war."
"""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"". Clip from old move, still relevant to-day!"
Correction. It's only sexual harassment if the woman doesn't find the man attractive.
It used to be comical that people would have such audacity to be policing others in such a childish way. It really is just an embarrassing grab for authority in position when there really is nothing to be had
"If it flies, floats or phucks, it's cheaper to rent."
Can you imagine if you reversed the genders and a man handing out a pamphlet to all the women explaining how to be appropriate.
"Women only want compliments from Chads.  Every other man need not offer their compliments, thank you very much."
And very soon technology will destroy and replace women
Men are having the last laugh as they walk away and give feminists what they want at first and later regret.
"I no longer mentor women. They don’t need help. The men need help in the workplace, most of the women are DEI hires"
The juice is no longer worth the squeeze.
"Just say they look dreadful, and if they had a issue, tell them they did not want us to say nice things, so we went just as negative as they are"
Actually the metoo movement destroyed women. Men walked away and women lost their minds
Were was the note to the women why are they able to say you look handsome
I don’t even call it the me too movement because I call it the lie too movement because most cases around the world have been proven to be lies.
"No no no.
Its destroyed women and freed men"
Him downplaying it doesn't really help to raise awareness
Removing compliments in this situation actually hurts females more than men.
"If it were my list, I’d have Nothing on it because Modern women deserve Nothing. 👎"
Glad I’m old and not having to date. If I were a young man and woman approached me at the bar I would immediately think I was being set up.
"I for one, am not ""destroyed"". My single male friends rejoice at being woman free.🇦🇺"
"LOL. I don't feel ""absolutely destroyed"". Drink some whiskey. Get over it. Remember, gentlemen: You are always fertile. The biological clock is her responsibility. Choose wisely."
"Pesident Ulysses S Grant once had a quote along the lines of: ""If we treat every man as if they're guilty... we will not be able to find good men when we need them."""
"Just sue in court the woman who did this note only to m'en fir discrimination and sexisme, lol !"
"Blokes should have turned around and said ""this is discrimination and harrassment""."
"The problem in not that women get an unwelcomed compliment, it's the fact that women who expect that compliment do not recieve it."
"The only thing I am scared of when it comes to these women is my emotions and my reactions, beyond that, these women ain't scaring nobody."
"Toxic feminism has destroyed the appeal of women, and the result is collapsing birth rates, and about to collapse welfare states and pensions."
Bypass the self crippling deal of modern marriage and just adopt if you want to start a family.
Very simple suggestion. Just start your compliment with the words “I don’t think you look………………”.
The best move started from Kerala ! We need such report in all industry 🎉
"Kerala is the first to appoint a committee to learn about the industry problem..
Other industries also should have this type of courage"
Mollywood does create impactful cinema and is the first in the film industry to establish a committee to ensure safety and equality for women. Kudos to Mollywood for spearheading this important reform.
Kudos to the actresses of Malayalam film industry for stepping up and fighting courageously while other industries use women for pleasure and benefits....🎉
"I am happy this has started atleast with Malayalam cinemas, Respect to those who came forward and acknowledged this.Now it's time for others too, I am sure this happens in bollywood and others too. It's high time now for everyone to stand up and speak. Let more of Hema committee be formed. Let this be a lesson for other too."
He should resign . But enquiry must be conducted and if  any action against law must be proceeded with.
"I am a man and I find it despicable that a woman, or anyone, should be forced to respect anyone against their free will."
Malayalam film industry is totally cleaning all the mess and its for good future.. but other industries face the same but no one is taking initiative for this cleansing process! Everyone should stand up for this 👍
"You lost your case when you said Today Super star .. He is an actor.. How come any actors become super stars wen they are ready to entertain, dance, drama for 3 hours for 100 rupees ? Society is screwing them.. They are actors, period.. Superstars are our parents who work day and night for us, our teachers , our friends who help us etc.."
Women are so badly treated.😢😢😢 Shameful.😢😢😢
"The important thing to notice is that the movies that arebreaking
Barriers anyways have not included this powerful nexus of actors... They always have been incapable of any progress"
"Now set up a committee to investigate Media, Politics, Police etc.. Lets hema committee be the first step towards this..."
What about media industry?
Same or worst exist in Bollywood.... Why only talk about mollywood
"Salute to you all for exposing the corruption and exploitation. From pakistan. You all are on the right path. 
Nothing would have happened if this was pakistan ."
"Why did he resign now. FEAR of being prosecuted or defamed ??? How convenient. He must have know all the happenings including the kidnapping & rape & torture of the actress, for SURE. But remained silent so his and his sons career is not affected. There is no way he did not know. Now he wants to play god. Super 👍🏼"
I ❤ Palki Sharma#she' s an honest journalist and says everything clear and cut throat! Keep rocking 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Do u understand this is the first time an industry going forward and correcting .
Its the same or worst in other film imdustries of south ..they dont come out
Good job... these pervert film production related criminals should be ashamed.
"🙊 This is the kind of society we live in, which govt, what law, what police, what feminism?!!!! Women are unsafe."
They're right to be punished.
I had huge respect for Mohanlal before seeing this video
"This issue is true in every other filim industry here in India (or world)
I hope we get them to also get a expose of them ..."
Should just be a precedent to many others that must be investigated throughout India.. toughest punishment should be handed over to such power group operators.
Exactly… but it's not only in the Malayalam industry but I feel it's in Bollywood too. And they don't even know that they are abusing the weakest. And they are proud of doing it.
I am suprsed  to come to know the happening in the kerala film industries
Kerala always leading cultural revolutions.. disrupting systems.. proud of you Girls and Boys ❤
Hypocrisy at its peak. 😊
Their State & National awards should be withdrawn if proved guilty !!
Mohanlal seems to successfully accomplished 1000 women in toto😢
"There is something which nobody noticed, there is hidden lobby against leadership of AMMA , they Jailed Dileep for crime done by Pulser Suni, 
Director Kamal (original name is Kamaal ) and director Renjith did the same crime but only Renjith had to resign from same post, 
There is a Jihadi & Missionaries lobby behind this drama, no Muslim actor name is coming out except Siddique who was supporting Dileep,"
"Well said, reel and real life are two very different things! 👍🏾✌🏾"
When will India start treating women with respect
I love the newscaster ❤ very powerful.in that case.....well done 👍
"This is what kerala has been from the past.
Exploiting the powerless until a days everything is exposed.
It's shameful."
"Real face of Kerala. No jobs there people prefer to go outside of Kerala to work. No industries because of bad policies of Communist govt ruling the state. Achievements of Kerala people highest number of people recruited in ISIS, Malayalam Cinema scandal women are not safe in Kerala."
"Respect to mohanlal!! Nowaday  position holding people don't even resign even after such cases and reports.... 
Direct example... Brij bushan singh!!!!!"
HIGHEST LITERACY RATE FOR CRIMINOLOGY.
Imagine a committe investigate about bollywood 😂
Movie and reality is always different. What u see is what is not
Why isn't the perspective not diplomatic and holistic. Mollywood speak up against violence and hold them accountable. Has even Hollywood done this?
"Every where this type of thing's happen, In  it is very less compare to other other flim industries in India. Mean while what about media industries...??"
"Mam, Entire flim industry in India works in same fashion among them one state alone got exposed !!!. Hope its one among the known secret's in india..."
He should be investigated and prosecuted if evidence exists against him. The crimes occurred under his leadership.
Keep pushing for equality for women in 2024.
This is there in every place.There are such groups everywhere. There are such people in every industry. Like Tovino said let it be remembered that the change started with Malayalam cinema(as always).
"Universal all 'woods' globally practice. Somebody exits, someone else fills in. Next? ... if ok to entertain, enter into entertainment. Show must go on.
Love from India 🔱💯💖"
It was high time Malayalam industry needed this clean up!
A reel life hero but A real-life villain 😢
But the biggest issue is where is the actual proof. How is this any different from the Zomato case?
What about Honey Rose?
"One thing I didn't understand what is the role of president of India, n our hounable p m should take action in this matter,"
🎉🎉❤☔☔☔☔☔☔ Mam pal🎉☕ .. 🌄
"Where I come from, men stand when a woman walks in or is about to sit at a table 😂"
Glad things are changing!
Well done Kerala.
This is why a particular community has progressed in Kerala and other honest citizens were left out. Everywhere we go we see the result of such dirty deeds being done
"This news is misleading. He is not involved in any of the accusations. He resigned because many other actors were accused, and as the president of the association, he chose to step down"
"The matter shouldn't end there, resigning doesn't yield the desired results. The responsible culprits  should be arrested and prosecuted and finally be banned from the industry.  We can see, as in other cases,  the probe and the investigations, be it by anyone else, take their own time thus delay the justice  to the victims."
Good job Mohanlal.
Same is in Bollywood They block outsider as  far  as possible . U meet Sushant like fate if are ambitious
Woman rights and freedom of choice and speech.  The laws must be inforce now against corruption practices and exploitation.
"Conduct such a committee enquiry in bollywood too. Kerala initiated this, the other states shall follow this way"
"The HEMA committee you mentioned has nothing concrete other than a power group. 
A power group is the whole point of having a committee in the first place. Whether the committee is behaving decocratically or autocratically is the only question. 

If you don't have facts, don't compensate it with activism 😂😂😂"
Do u think Mohanlal was not aware...??? Not possible
Tip of icedurg
"This exists in every industry , just that people are shit scared to talk"
Why did you leave wion palki? Was that a mollywood power group initiation
"BTW, the people who are under the scanner are not the new filmmakersthey are from 80s ..."
"Shame on the  mallus  who are very  proud  of their  superstar mohanalal, this is what  expected  from a literate  state  .. wow"
Yet they are the ones breaking the ice ❄
Now mohanlal  must reveal the villains

"Irony :most literate state is reeling under casting couches (favours by men for work opportunities for women ) 
This is evident not only education is important,.
QUALITY EDUCATION IS NEED OF HOUR(SDG 4)"
It's Happening all the indian film industries...May be International...
I am speechless.
"Malayalam industry is progressive to have an hema commission, why don't other industries do the same."
Well i regret resignation was late. Need investigation and Well done HEMA committee report. But nothing to do with women alone to stand. EVERYONE DOES
Dare any other government for such a report on their filim industry 😅
"Madam palki I had deep respect for you, these ladies who are protesting are they innocent, all of a sudden they realized they were sexually assaulted 
 Today's generation are ready to do anything to get inside cinema. Then where is this humma commission 😊 never stoop low to report such crap"
Manipur CM should have resigned too but yet he is there . Not supporting anyone but why he has not resigned?
How come Mammotty is not in news at all
Good! Book the rest accused. We don't need them.
Finally truth is taking over
Gods own country realities 👀🤷🏽‍♂️🙏🏽
AND AT THE CENTRE THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE BRIJBHOOSHANS RULE THE SPORTS FIELD. 😢😢
"Movie industry of india , they show it in their own movies like fashion , real life story of silk smitha the dirty picture , real life stories of women who gets into a toxic work culture... 
Make few women senior artist as head of the film department, this will solve the toxic work culture."
God's OWN COUNTRY 😂😂😂 100% literacy 👍👍👍
"Exploitation is everywhere. It's in cinema industry, in media industry, in textile industry, in construction industry everywhere. I worked for a construction company in Adoor (Kerala) called Builtech Builders and I didnt get any salary and then I resigned.  There are a lot of people, men and women who left this company similar way. They would conduct interviews once in every 3-5 months offering big salaries and absorb people and then after 2-3 months these people would be laid off and they would get no salary or a meagre amount. During their tenure there these people would be mentally  tortured and would be rendered as good for nothing fellows. And you won't dare to complain as you would be intimidated by the photos that are being posted in the various company whatsapp groups by the MD showing himself standing with many top politicians and ministers of Kerala State. So exploitation is everywhere."
Never Ending Story....🤔
Will there be a committee for bollywood?
Beautiful palki with beautiful earrings ❤
Firstpost has some new thing in hand now to talk about for a few weeks until they get something else😅
"I have only dought is this only in molly or anyother locations .just asking .i think its an only a point part of our total polulation not 1.4 just part of 8.
Yeah its good for all sake."
This happens in all film industry 😮 sad reality
Malayalam cinema bringing this into light will change how sexual harassment laws are enforced in India at every sector. At least Malayalam cinema brought the movement. All the other cinema industry is doing worse but hiding under the rug.
The risk of industry to human traficking undirectly but it weird such never done in court law
Madam what is your personal opinion about this?. I am a senior citizen of India since 1983  oct i am in abroad .if anyone wants to change the life they will be there to do any work...?. This is rubbish.
"Standing out if respect is ok. Be it a woman or a man who has to stand, it is ok.

Respect must be earned with performance and personality, not by flexing clout."
"My brother (at the time a 15y boy) was wrongly accused for rape together with a friend of his. 3 days in jail when the police didn't give them sleep and started questioning every half hour threatening my 15y old brother with violence.

After three days the victim showed up and looked through a one sided blind window and said she didn't recognize them, so they where free to go without the police saying sorry to the boys.

I got 3 other stories where boys and young men wrongly accused for rape and how our society is 99% of time siding up with females.

It is scary how much evil can be done by women with the blind support of police and society. Women that are blackmailing to get their way in live are the worst!"
"When sexually arrest men, and when a man tells her or he doesn’t say anything, people call him gay, but not knowing that it also makes him uncomfortable too, so he’s afraid to say something. People will judge him not judge him."
The black women is right
Blame Hollywood
We hire less women now because we don’t want our guys to get falsely accused.
This is why women dont come forward. These girls risked everything to tell their most embarassing stories. And this guy is walking free... i hope they are protected
"I saw a video of him lifting Cassie and slamming her, it broke my heart. This monster should be rotting in prison 💔"
He’s rich.
As a survivor who was failed by the justice system this is so heartbreaking and devastating… I really thought it would be different this time but I’m not surprised. Heart just aches for the victims
Actually the real reason he isn’t being charged with the serious offences is because it happened in America. You guys elected trump again and he broke the law how many times? Celebrities and rich people are not treated like we are treated in the USA
He’s rich and has people willing to do anything he asks.
We need more Mario's brother
We live in a victim blaming society.
"No, he walked because too many rich and famous people were involved ."
"Sadly, this isn't surprising"
"Honestly, I’m not surprised that Diddy got away with a slap on the wrist"
"Yeah honestly. The rule of law does not protect the innocent. Its main priority, especially in america, seems to be ensuring criminals are not convicted of too many crimes. Cause the prosecution was the government so they have access to as much evidence as they can sanction. All the defence has to do is figure out a way to weasel out of it. I think criminal lawyers get the easy ride too. They earn more and often use the tactic of badgering already vulnerable witnesses to weaken their testimony or relying on jury members being held in contempt. Just my perspective but i have VERY LITTLE faith in the rule of law as a woman. 
I see it fail us all the time, especially in SA cases, which is why we often refuse to report or press charges. Why bother when the odds are stacked against you even more"
The fact that people are complaining the procescution didn't cater to the jury is disgusting. We truly are a country where facts don't seem to matter anymore. It could happen right in front of their face and they would need to be convinced it happened.
If the stories are true he's committed much more heinous crimes then that he's being charged on. Just that his victims are too ashamed or afraid to come forward.
The real reason he wasn't found guilty is because there was no proof. End of story
Follow the money of the jury it will tell it all
Its not because he’s rich it’s because the thing jurors needed to believe was women in low standing and they would rather believe the man they’ve seen physical beat and abuse these people than the actual victims.
"Disappointing, but not surprising."
He is a waste of space and had a seriously gullible jury!🙄
Rich and depraved are always protected
"The justice system worked as intended. To protect the interests and the persons with power. It is not, and never has been, about righteousness."
He 100% is going to be part of DT's administration
It was misogyny. They simply didn’t believe the women.
"It wasnt the justice system that failed, it was the jury lol"
"Money talks, 💩💩 walks"
Witness testimony is the worst form of evidence allowed in the legal system. It sounds like that's why he was not found guilty on those counts. You need something more solid than just a bunch of accusations to convict someone of a crime.
"Please let this dude rot in prison, he's been doing messed up stuff since the 90s."
"Honestly, this verdict made me so upset and so disgusted at the geriatric jury! Stop having people from 1960. Make decisions for women in 2025. It’s absolutely disgusting. Sean is a human trafficking predator who beat and tortured women abused his employees literally committed Rico like activity and walked away because he’s famous tired. I hope the judge gives him the maximum I don’t care. I am furious with this."
Of COURSE Trump would pardon him! Women have to unite NOW!!!
"This is my third attempt to leave a comment on your video, but YouTube keeps deleting it.  The first comment was an intelligent response.  The second comment was me complaining about YT purposely deleting anti-Diddy comments and they even deleted that out!!!!  Let’s see if this third comment sticks.  Oh yeah!  There’s no intelligent comment in this third posting and the anti-Diddy stuff so yeah it’ll stick."
Nope. The witnesses painted themselves as willing participants in the freak offs. Ruined the entire case the more they spoke. He will still do 5-10.
"Weistein, Cosby and now Diddy.  Its absolutely disgusting how rich men just get a slap on the wrist"
Trump wanted a taste of Diddy party
This whole thing is like a Boondocks episode
Victim blaming.NOT COOL!
My point stands that Trump only ever pardons the worst people on Earth.
Start dishing our your own justice ladies. Just know how to do it
Tell me something new 😢
And they'll tell women not to use the second amendment
Because they were seeking life. I'm an up-to-20-year-total qualified juror.
The fact they keep saying he is going home with a possible 20 yrs sentence . Sounds like simething is shady. Make it make sense
"There was no evidence, I don't know why he even went to jail. I'm not saying he's not a bad person but the evidence wasn't there. I'm done with this channel this lady is too extreme"
outrageous.  They disregarded the victims.  Anyone found the children yet?  Disgusting!!!
"Nope, all wrong. You have no idea of what's really going on here. I promise it has nothing to do with the metoo movement. This is WAY more complex than anything like that."
Money
"Close enough, welcome back R-Kelly trial"
"Alternatively, we dont know the whole story as we weren't presented any of the evidence nor did we hear any rebuttals against that evidence, all we knew were the charges. Reminder a prosecutor doesn't need beyond a reasonable doubt evidence to CHARGE someone with a crime, they only need Probable Cause"
"You push things too far in one direction, and the pendulum will swing back."
Those jurors should be ashamed.
Yasssss. What about those kids and looking into child Protective Services. Where are these kids  coming from.
"All that baby oil was actually just to make sure no one could make the charges stick, apparently"
Why anyone has faith in The justice system is beyond me
"Lawyers are very skilled at discrediting women, they have methods to paint them as liars and twist their words into seeming like something it’s not. This is why women seldom speak up."
Such bull$hit
I'm not surprised
20 years in means he’s gonna die 💀 in prison.
A rico charge is for an organization not 1 person! That was stupid from the beginning.
I have a friend who is angry about the Diddy verdict but is a full on Trump loving cultist. How do women like her not realize that all of this is tied together?
Oh well. Seems to me when someone is put in prison we say the system finally worked and when someone is found not guilty we say the system is broken.
"I didn't follow, but I've seen people saying he didn't even have a defense, no witnesses, nothing..."
Free Luigi
Stay inside
"He’s being not guilty has nothing to do with being black! It’s because of being evil! Christ honors women and demonstrates it by choosing a woman for the 2 most honored responsibilities ever given: birth of Christ; and proclaiming, “He is Risen!” She became the first Evangelist!"
They didn't have more women on the jury because they couldn't find that many that couldn't say they havent been sexually assualted
What about the jailhouse phone call Diddy made telling his sons to destroy the evidence in his house before the cops find it
Lame take
Because he has too much money and has too much dirt on other wealthy people. That’s why!
Trump only pardoned him because he wants an invite to the next party.
8 men and 4 women.... Wow. Okay. Probably could have gone with an equal amount of men and women.... That's why they didn't find him guilty.
Amber Heard destroyed the MeToo movement
"#1 is he is rich. #2 idk her name, but the one lady stayed with or came back to him after being raped and abused."
Now he coming for the victims.
BTW Lil Tay Just Started Her OF
I'm sorry but women have a looong way to go to as far as same sentence for same crime n don't get me started on divorce and custody
Why doesnt nowthis post anything about israel?
"""witch hunt"" 😂 this country sucks."
Classic. Smh 😪
You don’t get to have your cake and eat it too. Judy found they were willing participants so yea.
"I know no details of this case, but it sure sounds like a good place to end jury trials.
Where I come from, we just don’t have them. We may need more judges, but it feels more suitable when times are changing but some people don’t want to go along with it."
Trump got him off
"It's violates human rights to want anyone ever to be convictable of anything, ever, only on believing a victim's word. Word against word is never ever evidence, hence never ever due process."
Also because money
For the people who don’t know when diddy was found guilty of “the transportation to engage” he was going to the house of women who worked at nowthis news cause that’s what they are
It’s because the jurors voted not guilty on the serious charges.  A fair jury was chosen.  Maybe the government didn’t prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
😂😂😂 wtf is wrong with all. The counts were unanimous so what about the 4 women on the jury? Yup its all men's fault 😂😂
💙🤮💙🤮💙🤮💙
🤬
I have mixed feelings on the metoo movement especially in regards to the johnny depp and amber heard trial
"There's more to it than not believing women. This limited scope will lead to villainizing jurors. There are elements of a crime that have to be met, beyond a reasonable doubt, to find someone guilty. Unless you're in the room or hearing jurors victim blaming, this hot take is irresponsible"
"This is the thing with current dems. Most men who vote don't care about this. Woman are vindictive. The voting age men dont like the lgbthdtv movement, or the me too movement. This loses you supporters. i hate current republicans but i dont like the current dems. Most men have to chose the lesser of two bad choices. Shame on you guys forcing your opinions on the whole of dems."
"I'm not a Diddy fan, but those women exchanged a lot of texts finding out when the next Freak Offs would be and who to bring."
Lol shut up he rapped men to what are you talking about? Stop blaming men
🫴⚖️
it did not fail women! Those women in the trial were 100% willing participants! Period!
"If that was on the drawer as a woman, I would’ve found him not guilty of every single charge"
That's a stretch to see that the democrat led search is motivated by metoo
Oof.
Not a backlash..Women just want to legalize jailing men on allegations alone …Your experience and account has to stand up to scrutiny ..
Its all men.
Will trump pardon diddy?
"She's a survivor alright, she survived falling out of a tree and hitting every branch with her face on the way down."
I think men are running from her instead of harassing her
I dont think this person has any reason to be part of the me too movement.
I'm kinda horrified that a woman is trying to make a difference and so many comments are negative and about her looks.
Looks exactly like KRS one!
"Here are some questions I would have asked:  
How is the Me Too movement affecting the way men treat women in business and in social situations?  
Are you concerned that the Me Too platform might have been used as a weapon to harm an innocent man?  
Do you think that men in the business world have more of an aversion to working with women because of your movement?
How is your movement affecting women's careers?
She asked all soft questions... her interview was more like an infomercial."
...guys take my advice. It ain't worth it. Much better things in life....spend your money on a new Corvette.
She looks unrapable though
"How about a HASHTAG for  ----->  ""  People need to grow up and stop making false claims and get on with their pathetic lives and stop acting like spoiled brats that think the entire world owes them everything "" ?"
Y’all are the reason why women are afraid to come out about sexual harassment. It’s ridiculous smh.
"In the history of the world, there have never been so many innocent individuals who have been members of any given movement."
#notme
"I don't understand how people can be so childish and cruel. This isn't about her appearance, it's about the movement. 

Existing in the age of YouTube comments is a curse of our modern world."
"What about the men who got sexually assaulted as lil boys ,,,talk about that"
"Sometime back, I can  remember on the news, a professional football player was accused of something by the me too movement. I can't remember the details of the case. But it turned out that the woman made the whole thing up. They found this guy innocent. But it didnt matter, he lost his career. I think the me too movement is made up of predators."
"It started as a great thing, but some people ruined it. The Me Too Movement should be about men and women of any color coming together because of the horrible things they’ve experienced, not a platform for people to gain attention through empathy for fake stories. People lying makes others suspicious of people who really went through things like this, which defeats the purpose of the whole movement."
God bless this Sister. She started this for one reason and it turned into something bigger. She has beautiful energy.
The best this woman can ever be is handsome.
"A person's character is everything, not how they look.. :) She is courageous to start such a movement against injustice.. Please stop judging ppl by they looks and have a broad mind.."
I have a deep regard for the displaced and the forgotten and the abused and the bullied and victimized of all ages .
Tara Reade wants justice too!
"Are you sure, what happened with her comes under Sexual Harassment not under Cruelty Against Animals?"
Who harassed this woman? Omg
She is full of stuff and a liar
I opened a door for a woman and I was accused of sexual harassment
Who would harass that cow?
If KRS don't come get his daughter. She out here trippin!
"the man who sexually harrased this women was either blind, mentally imbalanced or simply trying to win a bet from his mischeavous friends....."
Why are people more considered about her face and how she looks when the whole movement is about how sexual harassment of any kind shouldn’t be acceptable. Honestly it hurts to see people talk about how a person looks when  they clearly don’t have a clue of what may have happened to them . The whole movement is to educate others who aren’t aware of the situation or problem and help victims not to distinguish if celebs sell their bodies for a role . At the end of the day it’s clear to indicate the right from the wrong and it shouldn’t be right for people to harasses others in activities they don’t want to do for both men and woman .
I'm white i was raped by my brother at the age of 8  I blocked it out until I finally fell in love at 19 and at 23 I started having flashbacks . There is a lot more to my truth but it is very long . I have had no support other then my husband and he has been so grate at 14 I was put in a mental hospital  for evaluation and then put on lithium that made me sick and then prozak that made me violently angry . So I gave upon pills and just forced life . It's all a mess .  It is not just females of color it's not just certain economical classes it is not ever just a female issue yes it's mostly a female issue . How ever it is always a human issue why can't we just say that ?
"All women have to do is accuse and you lose. boy, that's real justice. hey ladies! what goes around comes around!"
Y’all are destroying our black men why
I'm 100% convinced that she's has never been the victim of sexual harassment.
Nothing for nothing but what man in his right mind would wanna hit THAT?? EWWWWWWW!!!!!! Should be more like #me-never
Extremely sad to read the comments below.. ppl are making fun of her looks.. she is a person who wants to bring change in the society.. hats off Tarana.. we r with you..
"A movement based on empathy I can understand. Currently, bigots have shifted focus from the issue of those being sexually harassed and assaulted. To the many women who falsely accused men of sexual assault."
"I love how the hashtag is also called a pound sign, so their movement is essentially pound me too"
This “movement” has erupted into a groundswell of false accusations against men in the workplace and elsewhere...
Yeah no one is abusing that female with a nose and face like that…
This comment section is exactly what is wrong with the world
Keep on fighting the good fight! Thank you!
"Oh look, it's krs one"
Before we judge anyone in life take a long look into the mirror and ask yourself what Sins have I done in my lifetime!
She look like the lady in the tavern who harasses all the men in the bar but no one wants to take her home
"women complain when you look at them, and then complain when you don't!"
"Wait... someone sexually harassed THAT lady..? Please....
Me too movement is just a way to further oppress good men."
who in their right sense would even approach this so called founder???!!! Ugh!
Who is the inhuman monster that sexually assaulted her? He needs to have his head examined by human and animal behavioral psychologists. This is too much. Never again
This comments system is truly disgusting U should be ashamed of yourself for being so cruel to this woman who is just trying to make a difference
Newly-resurfaced video from decades ago lends support to allegations against Joe Biden
Leslie Jones is prettier than the Me Too lady
I wanna know how harrassed Burke! Because she definitely has a face for radio!
"She made this in 2006 you dont know how she looked then and dont be so quick to judge a persons appearance,  your looks will fade and all youll have left is your legacy. At least she is building hers what the heck are you doing with your life?"
"Wow, seems kinda odd to me that this lady was sexually harrassed. That is one ugly woman, guess there are some desperate dudes out there in the world. Yikes."
"Whos mans is this??? 

Stop saying Women or people of color (Black women, men and children) 

Got bamboozled again"
Cory Feldman and Alysa Malano started it.
I feel it is sad when hear say from 30 years ago . Puts a end to justice. Use to be a person had to have evidence and was a statue of limitations. Also the women that really had something tremble happened to them and need the help . The gold digging women hurt them by making a mockery out of system and the true pain they Felt.
"Did the cop accused of gripping and groping a woman's breast really have consent to do so ? Well, the public will always  decide ."
"SANDRA BLAND DIDN'T GET A ME TOO SUPPORT , BLACK WOMEN BEING HARASSED BY POLICE DIDNT GET ME TOO ,"
she got a jawbone on her
This woman is a rolemodel because she is no classic beauty but carries herself like one. I love that !!!
"You know what I hate about the metoo movement. They will get away with anything and everything that is considered harassment when some of the things people do is Not even considered harassment.

Im sick in tired of the harassment card as well. Even looking at them in the eye...now they will think that is harassment."
Now should start #not me movement
"They don't care about me too. It's all about power, political power. It's so evident now that it's crazy how any Democrat still falls for their hypocrisy."
It’s a guy on the NACCP making money off this meet too movement shameless people . So this man taking pics with people who was actually charge and this man help him get off wow. So they pic and choose who they go after UNBELIEVABLE.
It is extremely sad for people to criticize someone who is trying to take a stand and do the right thing.How she looks or anyone else has nothing to do with someone abusing their power and taking advantage of people.  The harsh reality is the comments are a reflection of why people keep things a secret.. hypocrisy is real.....
This movement is an embarrassment to all women widespread. Disgraceful.
Proud of Tarana!Keep speaking out!
"arrest the man that harrased her,bestiality is illegal"
"""Whoop Whoop, that's the sound of the beast!""  ""Whoop Whoop, that's sound of the police!"""
Me too ? Yeah you wish.
"It be Fugly and will throw feces at you. Run fast, run far."
"I love when liberal journalists use the term ""grassroots"", like THEY are in that group. The ""grassroots"" people, which believe in protecting the American culture, are the working class people who voted for Trump. They want less immigrants as well as properly vetted immigrants."
These comments show the true direction this sinking ship called America is sadly headed.
It’s honestly sad how many people are being so rude and evil in the comments. She is a beautiful black woman who is strong enough to stand up for women.
Beautiful brave woman
Most of the these actresses sold there bodies for movie roles. Thats all it really was an uncomfortable/regrettable moment in there lives.
"What about Biden?
Me too is a sham"
"The “me too” movement is an example of abuse of “female-gender-privilege”.

“Chivalry” or “female-gender-privilege” exists when women play into the role of female weakness for a given benefit.  As opposed to “male chauvinism”, it involves the active or passive signaling of female gender inferiority or weakness.

The abuse of the “me too” movement was evident when females started becoming “victims” in places males would not be considered victims.  If a woman flashed her chest to a male, the male would not be considered a victim, for example.  Nor would he be victim, for receiving an indecent proposal.

“Chivalry” has led to gender-bias in sentencing and has encouraged “hearsay only”  and “no evidence based” civil and criminal complaints against an entirely male population.

#nikkobriteramos #genderbias #criminaljustice #chauvinism #chivalry"
Me too? No thanks
How can you head the metoo movement when u a man
Don't be fooled by tarana Burke face.
"Wtf is wrong with those people, blame everyone else then themselves. biggest scam artists on this planet."
"Afraid to read a lot of stupid and totally old-fashioned comments (mostly from prehistoric-minded men, not surprising) and most on Miss Burke's physical appearance, which shows a lack of consciousness and deep thinking...How sad !"
Double woof.
Ask a women catcalling only applies to below average/ugly men. Handsome/Rich men can catcall say the exact same thing the ugly guy said and it's 👍 ok.
can anyone go to the police that were physically abused by a predator or is this only for women? im asking for a friend.
Me too movement = beauty and the beast me too being the beauty and the woman being the beast
Still shocked that Oprah has not covered on Harvey Weinstein who is convicted but did a show bout MJ who was acquitted and dead
Wtf is that
That's a man
Damn!!!  She's the face of the me too movement!!???
I can't imagine her being sexually harassed due to her face
Come  on Cletus
May someone please tell me why you all think this woman lied to us?
"Ma'am, you created a weapon that can be used because of personal dislike ."

Me too movement has done nothing to come to the support of trump's alleged victims.

"It's sad to see some women using this beautiful movement to spread their hatred against men. I'm a woman and I do not support that because I have a brother, I have incredible male friends and I'll have a husband someday and they mean to me."
I think they should apologize to Johnny after falsely accusing him of DA without a single proof and believing Amber without even trying to see if she was actually lying or not.
"I’m right-leaning and currently doing research critique on MeToo and modern feminism. There is a ton of hypocrisy and logical inconsistencies in the movements.

 Nonetheless, I think the mean comments here cross the line. I hope we maintain a respectful debate of ideologies instead of becoming what we hate."
Isn’t it ironic that a woman who is talking about sexual violence is met with objectification and demeaning by men and women alike about her looks. #disgusting
It's hard to believed that this woman has been sexually harrased
So this is the lady that caused all this hatred against men and brought us to this point.
Its really too bad this movement was infested with idiots and liars claiming to be victims even though  they aren't.
"i sense this woman has experienced plenty of trauma growing up, its a great shame she seems like a powerful and confident woman today."
She's definitely beautiful inside out and brave which matters the most than the ppl who are commenting the way she looks ..its ridiculous to see hate comments!
I just read your book and I am in awe of you sis! Thank you for using your voice and reclaiming your work🙏🏽❤️
Amber Heard has made a mockerey of this movement.
"I think the Me Too movement is doing a great job by helping survivors of sexual violence see that they are not alone and at the same time this movement helps to improve awareness about how wide is sexual violence and the importance we should put into this topic. Sexual violence is a serious problem that affects the victim for the rest of their lives and this movement tries to help the victim to overcome the situation through empathy and by not letting them stand alone, they encourage the victim to tell their stories and not be ashamed. For me this is a great way to help someone that suffered from this, to keep going and when they tell their stories it helps for other people to understand how serious is this problematic. This problem can't be eradicated so easily but we should start with ourselves, to take action in talking about the subject in order to create an understanding of this."
"I fully support the me too movement, but more should be done to vet some of these claims, before blind support is given.  As a survivor of  physical and mental abuse by my ex wife for the 6 years of my marriage, I was the one who was being accused in court. Some women will use an organization such as this to benefit themselves in such matters as divorce or custody."
"I feel sorry for the ones commenting about her nose and how she came up with me too because a man refused to sleep with her. 
Lord I’m sorry man I hope y’all get well soon. 
Your mentality needs some serious help, I hope y’all get it."
"Did not talk about, how the movement is being misused."
"This is sad to see people comment more on how she look like rather than the video itself, those guys who comment about her look probably look ugly 😐"
I’m wondering if the me to movement will be going over to Afghanistan to help the women over there? Just asked a question
Me Too does not attack all men! What does do is Call out Men who use their status against women using sex in the Work Place! It’s not just in upper society! There are lots of Bosses  and Religious Figures who force sex on the unwilling and vulnerable taking advantage of their need for a merger job.
This woman has  N   O   S   T   R   I   L   S.
Thank the CEO for destroying relationships
"Friendly reminder that this is now pointless, the movement died"
Peoples comments are genuinely disgraceful please keep your discriminating comments to yourself 👋🏼
Very informative!!!! on the side not - the video and background music are giving out different energies.
Who's here because of Amber heard?
This need to include young boys to when grown women sexual assault and have a baby. For some reason women think boys don’t get molested and think this is how to interact with females. Them same boys grow up to be men and the cycle continue because they don’t know right from wrong when nobody help them from a grown person.
She looks like a background character in a Star Wars movie
This happens to both genders.
"Me too.

I was at the train and it was crowded.
I stood there because there wasn't any seat available.
So this woman came forward and cupped my gentiles. She was impressed as her facial expression showed  🥹  but that is not 😡.
She then went and reported me for letting her cup my gentiles. How on earth I could have guessed what she was about to do as she came close. I was stuck in between many people standing in the train carriage.
For this reason, I say me too."
"Why people hated this tho, if you are not some Bill Cosby type of guy this is not gonna affect you"
Where is the movement for the children
Me too is a movement that persecutes men. He does not seek justice. You are inquisition.. Johnny Deep 🌹
"What about those of us men who were and are targeted by predators who are seasoned in what they do, act as a collective and in my case, working in tandem with racist to vilify, demonize, and criminalize my character and credibility?

Trump  👍👍👍
These comments are cancerous.
Unpopular opinion: white Women ruined the me too movement
Rewind 2018: MeToo Movement
So many positives and many negatives about this movement. My family just happens to be going through the negative portion of it. My step son's ex girlfriend and her family of white trash called sexual assault with a knife against him and he is only 14. We know he didn't do this and CAS has background on this family in them with sexual assault and such. This girl has cut herself in our bathroom on her leg and a month after the breakup she does this bullshit and now our son will never get into the army and get a job anywhere. He won't be able to travel again. Doesn't matter if it is proved he didn't do it. The charge will forever be on his record.
"Thank you very much for all of your time and tear for all of this and I appreciate everything that you have done and are doing and if I can be of any help just let me know, I certainly understand this beyond words! I had many testimonies to help others& anyone that Heavenly Father puts in my path🙏☝️✌❤  I give heartfelt thanks to our heavenly father☝️ in the precious name of  his son Jesus ☝️may the  gifts of the Holy Spirit  be felt every day, in every breath we take, with positive peace, that passes all understanding! in the name of Jesus,  ..I pray amen and amen!🙏☝️✌✌❤❤☝️❤🙏"
It's not a sexual assault if the women takes 10 to 20 years to come out and say it
who the fuck would sexually harass that thing
This is why the Chad's Ray Ray and Tyrone's don't want to approach the women anymore.
Metoo is an popularity contest
What man in his right mind would come on to this woman? Or perhaps she was just seeking attention.
"Sexual violence includes people sending their target unwanted explicit pictures, dropping their pants while mooning people in person; yelling at them in public while swearing at them only because they are not looking down at the ground all of the time only; opening packages not addressed to them when seeing a package with their name on it, using developer tools before getting permission to offer special effects while using messenger to contact them; stealing whole sentences and paragraphs from them while looking for dirt on them; etc. etc. etc. Just because some people in that kind of crowd are famous when not doing things like that nearly as often does not mean they are any less repsonsible for participating in that kind of harrasement called gang stalking."

This WILL back fire. Not only does this follow a man for the rest of his life, this will also follow the accusers (woman) for the rest of their lives also. Woman, Good Luck with that promotion, new job, or even finding a date. The Me Too movement is woman's custom designed kryptonite, and loneliness is your end game.
Also, the fact that the accusers names are never revealed, but the accused is executed on the spot, without any investigations, shows us the justice system is run by a woman, and the news reporters should be locked up for reporting on this before due process has been played out. The networks will be sued like never before. And i am looking forward to it.
Relax guys, revenge is coming. The world will find out about these Yoga Pants wearing hair bun sporting couch crushing face book war-shippers, that cant cook, clean house or do anything really, except be angry at the world because nothing fits anymore. 
I'm sure if we tried a little, all kinds of dirt will be found out about these so called victims. And it probably wont be necessary to go back years in the past. The females are cornering themselves into complete rejection. The accusers will forever carry the tag of finger pointer. Because of it, they will become unemployed, nobody will hire them, and become very lonely cause they cant go into public anymore. Only to avoid offending the woman. They offend themselves every time they look in a mirror. So enjoy your yoga pants, and renew your netflix subscription and get an extra large bag of oreo's so you can continue binge watching the walking dead, because that is the future the woman have created for themselves. LMAO ""Me Too"" will change .....
I wear Yoga Pants because nothing else fits...... Me Too
My home is a mess.... Me Too
I cant cook but I can reheat..... Me too
I cant stop binge watching netflix..... Me too.
I can destroy a box of cookies in one sitting...... Me Too
I can crush a couch in one sitting.... Me Too
I cant keep a man happy.... Me too
The bigger I get, the meaner I get... Me Too
No man will even look at me now because of the ME TOO movement..... Me too"
I watched your video defending amber while you condemned Johnny that was so bad of you .
Anything associated with a movement usually smells foul and should be flushed away from society....
Where are you now about what happened on Oct. 7 ‘23 & the hostages that have been taken. Or is that not popular to stand for them with all the antisemitism?
She didn't start it though. She literally started a movement based off OTHER people starting the complaints. She banked off celebrity women. She is disgraceful to me
Oh boy an assignment on the Me Too movement. I hope the comments will help me in conjunction with the video. :clueless:
I have a question what is worse MeToo or Black Lives Matter
Me too and femenism in general is a joke !
Im black and damnnnnnnn her nose is big as hellll
"When a movement results in the infringement of the rights of others, in terms of DUE PROCESS, it should NEVER be allowed in the court system. If MSM continues to support unprovable accusations, then THEY should be held liable. Part of being an ADULT, is TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS, which means not putting yourself in a position when and where abuse may occur. Sexual abuse has been around since the beginning of time so you can't claim ignorance, but you might be able to blame your mother for not raising you with any common sense. You'd have to be born, and raised, under a rock not to know that at the forefront of the majority of these abusive environments is in the entertainment industry. Any idiot knows that. But apparently we're having an IDIOT epidemic right now. If the roles were reversed and you had to PROVE your innocence...could you? Think about it...although thinking really isn't your strong suit, is it?"
worst trend of 2017
"Where was the me- too movement when this Leah ""biological male"" Thomas broke all the women's"
"UN Women, Democratic Women’s Caucus, Me Too, Emilys Liste,  AAU, WHO, I Stand With Her, and many, many more. Have you no shame? Where are you???"
what happened to her face tho
"In particular, black and brown girls.  Because they're obviously more important."
Just imagine to meet this one where it’s day light ( usually it’s dark alley to be affraid of) in her case day light it’s her enemy.
A wise man once said : There is something worse than death it’s called bad woman.
Your 👃kinda wild
"Why are the only people not being asked to take responsibility the ones who are claiming to be victims? Do the woman have NO responsibility at all? LET ME BE CLEAR. I am absolutely NOT talking about victim blaming. Nor am I saying that any kind of assault / bullying / intimidation can ever be right. And I certainly admire the lady in this video. SHE did what should have been done years ago.

 However, the ""casting couch"" is not a new phenomena, it was first spoken about in 1937!!! Over 80 years ago! So any young woman who wanted to be a famous actress was aware of this existing phenomenon. (Again NOT saying that made it right. Just made it a fact) If they were young then we can absolutely understand their making the foolish decision to submit to it - but did none of them have parents / guardians / older people to stand up for them? 
More importantly, where were the now famous actresses  who went before these modern victims in the decades in between?
What I find sickening, not praiseworthy, is these now incredibly famous POWERFUL women are standing up as heroes of the MeToo movement. Why Merrill did you not speak up IMMEDIATELY when you were famous enough to do something? (I remember you from Kramer v Kramer in 1979  so you have had decades to change things.)You saw all these young women coming after you, decade after decade, and you kept SILENT. You have had 40 years of fame and fortune where you have not had to worry about your career being damaged by speaking out about the corruption in your industry. And yet until now, you did nothing, said nothing.
And now we are supposed to praise you for speaking up? As someone once famously said, “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”"

So rkelly hit 🤔🤔
"so sexual violence is a very widespread issue that affects lots of females and women do they know 'where' it is coming from, any like 'specific origin' or is it widespread across all genders and backgrounds? 'who' is 'targeting' 'who' in this widespread issue of sexual violence? "
"I understand what this movement was supposedly “intended” to be but it’s just turned into a weapon designed to destroy men at will and we’re seeing this play out right now in the dating scene because if men so happen to reach out to women or look at them a particular way, she could cry wolf and that right there is absolutely dangerous!"
I dont have no problem with the movement  but the meme with the virgin mary is disgusting and blaspheming.
⁠y’all keep talking about her appearance. Predators don’t care what a victim looks like . It’s about power. I’m positive she has experienced a lot of trauma throughout her life due to her looks alone. Someone probably did it with the same mindset of “who’d believe that someone would S.A. you?” Which would make them get away with it. That’s a messed up feeling.
Remember TARA...
I'm dreaming about being a blunt.... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They turn it into something horrible
"I will not drink so much, bro/"
the reason why romance is dead making me look bad as a man now as someone who is single af since birth i feel hopeless
So it's still a competition between the races even in matters of sexual violence? I thought sexual violence was bad irrespective of race or gender.
Free my nigga cill bosby
I feel like she is mad because nobody wants her. And the people that she likes don’t like her back
I’m glad they let men join to
She didn’t found the Me Too movement!
So tell me when are you guys going to apologize on camera in front of the whole world and say sorry to Johnny Depp for what you have done and how Amber heard should not be at spoke person for you people I feel sorry for you this is for sure but wrong was done you guys know a wrong was done So it's time to swallow your pride and apologize to Johnny Depp. And never ever use Amber heard for a spokesperson for me to movement. So make your apology to all the big television studios down there in the States so everybody in the world can see it if you don't think you are a hypocrite.
Me too.
Guys ; ease up on the Burke; no wonder these #metoo women are getting nasty;
To the dude that violated the founder of this poathetic movement: get some fvcking glasses my guy!
"heard about this movement (by accident) through led zeppelin. never heard if it, b4. had 2 examine a separate video 2 see what it was"
"Eeew, not me!!!!"
Shame it was abused nd used as a power trip for some woman to spread there personal hatred towards men
Good LAWD....no comment
She wanted to do something gr8...it went downhill pretty bad huh
"She looks like a female version of Shrek, only NOT green.  Will youtube ban me if I say ""black""?"
What every happen to this movements it was everywhere 3 years ago?
When are you going to address the blatant sexual violence and womanizing found in almost EVERY RAP SONG?
Why is me too movement not doing anything about the 1000s Uber and Lyft drivers accusations of raping of adults and underage girls. Of their customers
Believe all women because they said so 🤬 this is a cry wolf scenario waiting to happen in fact it's already happened. Any woman that falsely accuses a man of rape is screwing over the actual victims. Possibly the most selfish thing you could ever do it really comes down to the fact that they just don't like a certain guy or you don't like men so they want to create false allegations
This why charlamagne tha god changed his ways lol

"Je suis un HOMME. J'ais vu des jeune filles se faire harceler trois fois par des jeunes HOMMES. Ils passaient en voiture en disant qu'elles étaient bonnes. Une autre fois, dans le tramway, heureusement elles ne se sont pas laissées faire.... Je me demande si ces jeunes ont fait leurs éducations sexuel en regardant des films pornographiques très très jeunes avec leurs portables payés par leurs parents?   Les relations entre filles et garçons se sont dégradés..... Dans ma jeunesse on avait un  meilleure rapport avec les filles.   On avait encore notre innocence à 15/16 ans....On prenait notre temps pour se connaître.....Les jeux de séduction étaient maladroit, on était un peux gauche, mais on ne franchait pas les limites....On s'envoyait des petits mots ou un entremetteur rapportait les lettres ou les petits mots d'amour.   En fait la drague se faisait dans la douceur.....J'espère que ça existe toujours....Les filles deviennent un peux moins féminines qu'à mon époque. Je pense que c'est aussi une façon de se protéger.....C'est triste."

"Boys were not ""left behind"".  They were abandoned."
"At some point, we need to stop titling these videos ""boys left behind"" and begin to approach the truth that is ""boys held back""."
Women never “out ran” men. They were put in an elevator while men were denied access and told to take the slippery stairs the women oiled up.
"She makes a point about therapy for men, but in my experience (I work in mental health), men get better when they're DOING something, rather than just talking about their feelings. So many young men are single, unemployed, depressed, and feel powerless. They need to be doing something in their lives they can be proud of."
"“Women kept running and men got left behind” is a completely erroneous way of putting it. Women have been propped up by government and DEI initiatives of some form or another. It’s not that women have outrun men. It’s that men have been systemically hindered while women have been boosted. And this is not just in terms of admissions and hiring, it’s a psychological operation as well that has taught men to step aside and encouraged them to be more like women."
"Ive been a therapist for 12 years, mostly working with men in addiction. They are denied access to their kids, have no highly paying job opportunities, and are told they are toxic. I now work with adolescent ADHD boys. I wrote vastly about it. John, I would love to share it with you. It's also part of the reason i started my own channel. God bless you for talking about this!"
"It’s not merely that women left men behind, we chose to reshape society to place and keep women ahead. This systematic female favoritism is in schooling, the legal system, workplaces, technological development, publishing, banking, politics, and the military."
it drives me a little nuts how tradesmen are considered uneducated and for that are unattractive to women.......all the utilities are 99% work done by men.......our hardwork is being taken for granted
"It's not just young boys. I'm 58 and divorced for over 10 years. It's the same across the generations and has infected every level of our culture. It's a nightmare out there. I put myself out there, ask people out....nuthin. Crickets all around. At this time, it is now women who have to change and step up."
"""Choose emotionally healthy girls.""

Ah, great advice. So you are saying be on the hunt for the unicorn."
"In socialist hell hole Sweden where I live we have a ”ministry of equality” that has 135 employees, out of whom 114 are women, not very equal I’d say."
"34 years old here.
I watched my father and the fathers of every kid I knew in school have their lives destroyed by their wives.
Lesson learned."
"Have women replaced men in the family, or has government replaced men in the family?"
"There’s also 1 billion subsidies that support women at the cost of men. 

I did a Fullstack Developer bootcamp, and they offered scholarships that would pay half or all of the bootcamp if you were a woman, and also girl-only lunches.

Not necessarily against these, but male mentorship is super important."
a female therapist that isn't anti masculinity. So rare. Possibly the only one on the planet
"This culture has broken the boys of this country, and I fear, it is on purpose."
"Unfortunately therapy got us to this point. The therapeutic profession is broken. I got my masters in clinical mental health, and I would not trust one of the people in my program to actually help someone. I may agree that competent therapy could help but the training profession in therapy is broken."
"Sadly, there are many women and progressive men in K-12 education who marginalize young men. It’s arguably worse in higher ed. I’m glad to see this conversation happening."
I think male hate is more common. I know lots of women who just casually say they hate men because they are bitter.
"When John Papola talked about his son saying ""you don't know what it's like..."", his son was describing how he will be called out, judged and possibly ""shamed"" for ""making a move"" and most importantly, the mocking, shaming and judging  that will come form both men and women  if/when he gets rejected from making a move in the first place.
This is something that seriously needs to be discussed."
I was raised to believe that physical sexual desire for women was misogyny and i denied my own desires to the point of messing up my sexuality.  This is an epidemic right now. Glad to see these conversations are happening
The entire school systems goal is to elevate girls at the expense of the boys. This has been going on since i was in grade school in the late 80s early 90s n
"You don't ""re-balance the classes."" You re-balance the male-female relationships, and the classes will take care of themselves."
"I am the father of two boys. Happily, well adjusted, fearless, and successful. Because of sports, i was able to interact with many parents. One woman, Asian, made a very insightful and interesting comment. She said, ""This country hasn't figured out how to raise their boys.""  The comment was made in 2010. Our sons were in the 10th grade."
"I loved her advice about dating ""Date emotionally healthy women.""  How do you find out if the woman is emotionally healthy ""Go out to dinner."" Ummnn...  That's definitely a chicken and egg thing.  Don't know if she's emotionally stable until you date her and yet you need to know if she's emotionally stable before you approach her and she screams her head off that you're going to do something bad to her."
"As a single dad (widower) raising 6 boys under the age of 9, and also having raised 6 who are now young adults, this was a topic I looked forward to listening to. Being a boy dad is all I've known for my entire adult life. Before having kids I worked with early school-age kids in the public school system, mainly assigned to work with unhappy kids struggling to adjust to the school routine. All the kids I was assigned to work with were boys and all of them felt like they didn't belong in the public school community. In hindsight I can see that I wasn't assigned to those kids because the teachers and admin staff believed I was specially talented at helping them. They simply didn't like the boys or want to waste their own time on them so they used me to keep the boys out of their hair. I could see early on that public school is built like a family, but a thoroughly dysfunctional one that favours some of the kids and pathologizes/scapegoats the rest - the boys. 

When my boys reached school age I tried the public system for a few years and assumed that because of my experience in the system working with troubled kids I couldn't possibly run into any problems with my own kids at school. However, I soon saw my boys as miserable as the troubled kids I'd worked with years earlier. I pulled the boys and started homeschooling. Such an easy solution. They have no exposure to any media, entertainment, schooling or devices that constantly convey the message that boys are defective faulty beings who can only become ""good"" by being more girl-like. They are simply free to grow up as boys without any interference attempting to distort their nature. It's how all boys were permitted to grow up before the woke assault on boys.

I enjoyed the early segments and was in strong agreement with some of Erica's points. As the discussion continued I felt myself drifting further away from her position. It felt like she was mainly trying to sell therapy. Erica recognizes that boys are being pathologized but then she pathologizes the solution to this problem. In her view bad therapies and bad systems create the problems, but then creating new ""good"" therapies and systems can fix them. I agree with your view that if people stop trying to break boys in the first place, in part by fixating on the world of therapies and labels, we wouldn't have such a large problem of having to fix them. Erica suggests that therapy is the antidote to being poisoned by these toxic systems while you (and I too) simply say: ""how about we don't poison the boys in the first place - then we don't need to use the antidote either.

While I wanted to agree more with Erica I felt myself drifting further away from her position and couldn't put my finger on why I felt that way. Toward the end her mask slipped and it became clear. When she made the statement that she didn't trust parents to know what's best for their kids she lost me entirely. And it looked like she lost you too at that moment but you politely allowed the interview to wind down without too much push-back on that.

I thought that statement about the role of parents was ludicrous. For two hours we heard how deconstructionists have created the chaos we see now in our schools and culture. We heard how parents who turn themselves into non-parents by being selfish, narcissistic or by abdicating their parental responsibilities to other non-parents, are the problem. The best solution is for kids to have two solid parents, a mother and father. But then by stating that she has no faith in parents, and wants to replace that role with a Utopian system run by an enlightened class, she essentially admits that she's for the deconstruction of the family. There is no greater act of deconstruction than the dismantling or undermining of the family and parental roles. 

I finally could see then why I couldn't get on the same page with Erica, in spite of wanting to so much. She has spent her working life as a priestess in the church of psychology and may feel that as long as kids are treated by people in her anointed class they may be saved. All other systems, classes, and the family too, cannot be trusted to be as competent at doing what the anointed therapy class can do. This is typical confused progressive Marxist garbage. 

How does the therapy class decide what is good and healthy for kids if they don't trust the parents? They decide on their own without the parents? Isn't this the very problem we have right now with the promotion of all the gender delusions in our schools? It feels too much like the invention of a new religion with a new anointed priest class that has decided it knows what is ""true"" or ""right"", but can only work if it can destroy all the religions that came before it. Deconstructionism.

Erica totally lost me on this. It is not for a woke academic to decide what is true or right, nor will they ever be more in tune to the needs of kids, and more motivated to meet those needs to the best of their ability, than that child's own parents.

Though I headed into this agreeing with the early segments, and by the end had some strong disagreements, I liked listening to this interview, and your others too. Most of my days the only conversations I hear are with boys under the age of 9 so spending a couple hours every now and then listening to one of my people helps me get my bearings back.😁"
"ok right off the bat I have criticisms about some of the assumptions made here. the idea that more women go to college means that women got ahead and men are being left behind is a blanket statement that needs to be dug into more: are they going to useful degrees, or are they just accumulating tremendous student debt? what about trades? Are we just going to continue the elitist view that a tradesman is less than a university graduate, even if that graduate degree is in interpretive dance therapy? Also the idea that this adversarial attitude started with MeToo is basically the previous generation saying ""oh no, MY version of feminism wasn't adversarial, it's just this latest wave"" when in reality I see a lot of animosity in my parents' generation, stemming from this ideology that basically treats women as defective men. the adversarial attitude has been subtly pushed by media for decades now; think of the idiot dad trope. ""haha, this guy that provides for us on a single income is an idiot! laugh at him!"""
Saying psychoanalytic therapy is the only way to deal with mental health struggles is like saying that we only need oxycodone to manage disease. Simple fact is different therapies are useful for different things.
"No.  No quotas, and don't rebalance classrooms.  It's up to men to build an education system for boys that gives them the academic hard skills.  But it also must let them get out, take risks and exhaust themselves.  Women may never be interested in us again.  But we can still choose to be excellent.  And working together in male hierarchies to overcome challenges is one of our real strengths that we'd better leverage."
"They are not ""hating"" the ladies. They are demanding recompense and fair treatment. As they.should."
"Pro/Con of this episode: +) she acknowledges boys are in bad shape in current culture. -) she sees the only solution as therapy, the cause of this entire mess we are in. It nearly ALL leads south, no matter how well meaning the therapist and subject. Actions matter and need scientific/practical correction, thoughts/feelings are spiritual territory. These therapists are now the clergy. Mostly atheists teaching us how to handle our spiritual reality."
"""Do not participate in the hookup culture""

Ah, another amazing advice. In 2025 virtually all dating is hookup culture.
Then around the age of 32-38 about 10% of women wake up and desperately try to get themselves pregnant after a lifetime of hedonism, dozens of hookups, STDs, getting demolished by emotional wrecking balls, and so on.
Again the advice is to search for the unicorn - very useful, thanks!"
One false allegation was enough for me. Never again.
"I gotta say as a man of 54, i can identify with all of this stuff much earlier than some people. I had a mother who was a ground floor feminist, and she built a view of women in our house that they were supposed to be on a pedestal, and that they don't do wrong. It actually made my brother and I are a little afraid of women or maybe insecure is a better way to put it. Fast forward to nineteen eighty three I watched that same mother cheat on my father and destroy her entire family for another man and leave the family. Can you imagine what that did to a kid's mind When he learned the true nature of women? It took me years to unravel that and sometimes I still have trouble with it and I'd be lying if I said it didn't affect my relations with women. In my life i've managed to bed 15 different women. But I have to say there is a little bit of a love hate relationship with them inside me and it all goes back to my mother and the subject that you're talking about here"
"The moment she said women were disempowered at some point in history so it was a good thing we empowered them, this tells me she believes the feminist revisionist history.

I would push back and question, were women actually disempowered? Or did they have all the power they needed to be women and they just weren’t satisfied with just being women?"
"Women didn't ""keep running"". They were put in a car made by and paid for by men who are also required to drive it so the women get ahead."
It is fascinating watching this once great society come unraveled. What a time to be alive!
The answer is “more top down social control”?
A yacht is cheaper than a divorce Bro. Go sailing. 😂
"Boys being held back, but why? And by who and what mechanisms? Asking questions like these gets you quickly labeled as an “ist” or “phobe”. The sad part is, when you try to explain this to someone (especially a woman) they often don’t see a problem with it."
"i always marvel at how wrong these psychologists get these issues, she doesn't have a clue about boys and men."
"7:33 I feel like nearly everything she has said up to this point has been different from what I feel and my experience. Maybe it’s just me.

I’m not angry that my sons might be left behind. I’m angry that people have created systems which punish and reward people based on immutable character characteristics.

She acts like this stuff happened in a vacuum. Women just sprinted past men because… They are just fast?   No. That’s not why men are upset. That’s not why women with sons are upset.

They are upset because 53% of all workers in the United States were forced to take mandatory DEI trainings.  They’re upset because society has been telling boys and men that they are inherently bad.  They are upset because of the demonization of males, opportunities have been given to females not based on the virtue of merit or character, but by the virtue of the junk between their legs and the idea that men are inherently bad.

That’s what people are upset about. They’re not upset about being out done.  Men are really good at understanding and taking place in a hierarchy.  People are upset that it hasn’t been fair.

And they are upset that this unfairness to do great harm to both sons and daughters and the future has been brought about by weaponizing people’s real empathy, but even more importantly, they’re upset that it has been done by corrupt people benefiting from just wanting to look/feel good and virtuous while being anything but.

But I think the things that she says after that point makes sense generally speaking.

I agree with most everything else she says, although I think I might phrase things differently, personally, that’s not something I think is particularly important"
There’s a program being introduced in UK schools to  combat misogyny in men and boys. I’d like to know how that’s going to help. It’s going to make men retreat from society even more . Doubling down with feminist misandry isn’t going to be taken well by men and boys.
"It’s interesting the female therapist asks for more men in her field to help boys yet by nature of a man coming into such a female-dominated industry, they have to accept Academic Post Modern notions which could be contrary to fostering Masculinity and discourages men being men and boys being boys. I don’t think you can have both. The game is rigged. So enjoy the scoreboard, ladies🤷🏻‍♂️ good luck to us all."
"Sorry, I have zero trust of anybody coming out of modern academia. Zero."
"We don't have the issue that women kept running and men got left behind. Men were told we have to not only let women win. But we have to do the running for them. Round all the edges of competition. Blunt the sharpness of progress, and Tell men if they aren't willing to allow women to claim success during failure it is putting women down to make them feel inadequate. While not caring how hard men and boys try. They either produce or they are worthless. And telling boys the lies we tell girls don't work. Because that lie isn't enforced in the real world like it is for women and girls."
"Some questions. 

1: Given that so many modern women wake up angry and consider anger a source of power, I am curious about why they think male anger is so inappropriate. 

2: Boys and men are subjected to injustice, they are not treated fairly, rules are often tilted in girl's favour, I'd  like to know which other emotion is more appropriate than anger?

3: Do these people realise how unpleasant, joyless and exploitative the experience of dating modern women can be for the average man?

4: Do they understand just how pointless it is trying to date women who often have standards for men that gods cannot meet? 

5: Why do they expect men to meekly go back to a marriage model that even they know is totally broken, abused for personal gain, highly destructive and toxic to the family unit men are expected to build and protect?

6: It's true that a few men are angry at women, it's also true that huge numbers of men just find these women unattractive and this gets reclassified as anger, not disinterest, despite all the evidence that men are not pursuing certain types of women in the numbers that those women expect. Why aren't they seeing this?"
"She keeps on saying ""that girl is not a mentally healthy girl"". Yes, we are aware of that but it's not going to protect the boy from the charge of rape destroying his life. She really needs to be more practical in terms of her advice. How do you identify mentally unhealthy people, because I struggle to do that at the age of 60 ?"
"Calling boys “fragile” implies a kind of inherent weakness or instability—like they break easily and need protecting.

But “reactive” is far more accurate and balanced. It describes a response style, not a flaw. It means boys might be more sensitive to stimuli, social dynamics, or emotional triggers, but it doesn’t frame them as weak—it frames them as more responsive to their environment. That can look like withdrawal, intensity, impulsivity, or hyper-awareness—not fragility.

And here’s something important:

Yes, biologically, boys are less resilient in early childhood. That’s not a flaw—it’s genetics. With only one X chromosome, they’re more vulnerable to developmental issues, neurological disorders, and complications early in life. Even into adulthood, women show greater resilience to disease and illness, while men tend to have greater resistance to physical trauma and injury.

That’s not opinion—that’s the biological tradeoff.

But it’s often misunderstood or misused.


The reason “fragile” gets used more often could be because:

1. Psychoanalytic language leans emotive – It’s trying to evoke compassion, but sometimes ends up sounding pathologizing.


2. There’s a cultural undercurrent of framing boys’ mental health through dysfunction or crisis, rather than development or adaptability.


3. “Fragile” supports a caretaking narrative—but at the cost of seeing boys as fundamentally broken, instead of complex and reactive to unmet needs, stress, or chaotic environments.

“Reactive” opens the door to deeper questions:

What are boys reacting to?
What expectations shape their expression?
What gets repressed or misunderstood?
What kind of support builds better responses?

She tries to point out bias narratives but then instinctively chooses not to reframe unfair narratives— id rather not to deny struggle, but to understand it and make room for strength"
"Women select, men struggle and compete to be selected. It's just men trying to navigate the social expectations that women impose. Men don't get to decide what those expectations are. We're never allowed to ask questions about women's expectations or their contribution to the given cultural arrangement, so there's just no solution. I don't know what to tell you."
The guest loses credibility when she minimizes the impact of divorce on children and tries to claim that the problem is that we just don't divorce well enough. That's simply not true.
"Just removing quotas would solve the issue. Women didn’t knock it out of the park, you were granted special dispensation on an unprecedented level. That’s why we’re in a slow motion collapse in direct correlation to your empowerment. 

Stop weighted admissions and special initiatives. Stop intersectionality, and this will be a corrected situation. You won’t though, too arrogant and secretly afraid."
"I think the whole ""I won't even try to ask out that woman because she'll reject me anyways"" is so common in Gen Z."
I liked the point about female superheroes being a copy and paste of their male counterparts. Made me think of why the titular character Nausicaa from the valley of the wind is so well written. She's the female ideal. She's a strong caring leader that inspires men though her refined feminine qualities.
Women took on the male role of CEO but they refused to take in the role of provider.  That is the problem.
Don’t listen to everything they are saying. Making the first move and she flips out is a very dangerous situation for the boy and must be avoided.
"Ex Army JAG here. 38:15 is spot on; in my Brigade during 2020-2021, 40% of allegations were proven to be false . There were NO consequences for the false reporting since Command did not want to ""deter"" anyone from reporting.  It destroyed the lives of those who were falsely accused since the Army's culture is ""guilty until proven innocent"" (i.e. getting flagged, removal from favorable actions due to investigation, promotions suspended, schools suspended, etc. you are just stuck in limbo until it's all over (which could be up to a year). Approaching and making the first move has extreme risk attached to it since that movement."
"All your talk is about ""what to change on boys""..... Are you joking ? not a word on girls have to change ?????"
"When I was growing up in the late ‘80s and into the ‘90s, there were so many boys being placed on Ritalin. I didn’t have ADD; I was dealing with anxiety and a lack of interest in some of the topics we were covering. That problem has only become worse since then, unfortunately."
"@50:10 Why does she say no in response to “building all of the things”?

Men literally built all of the things.

"""Make sure, if who you're dating is mentally healthy!"", is the quote of the century!!!!!!💪"
"That’s why we don’t commit anymore.  We work all day to come home to problems. Women today have the expectation that they will be a stay at home wife and the man is still supposed to work all day, pay her way through life, then come home cook, clean, and serve her because other single women on the internet deluded her into thinking that she’s a 10 when she’s a solid 4 on her best day.  Occasionally getting laid isnt worth all the problems, bills and stress"
"I saw a therapist tell the Dad Saves America guy that men need to look for women who are emotionally healthy, that aren’t “paranoid and persecuted”, and that aren’t afraid of their feminine side. I would say the same goes for guys…I had to learn this myself back when I came of age in the 90s and 00s, that a man needs to not be afraid of his masculine side too—he has to have those good male qualities that give him confidence and conviction that avoids him falling into “nice guy syndrome”, like you were saying. Men are at their best when they’re kind, but being nice is not a good place to be because you aren’t in touch with your masculinity enough to say no when you need to, or to express any negative emotions in healthy and appropriate ways. So there are plenty of messed up women and men alike, and both can work on themselves to improve, and they must also work on their ability to identify the emotionally broken people and the emotionally well people, and deal with their issues so that they are not attracted to the emotionally unstable persecuted or mean people who just bring chaos into people’s lives. And above all, men and women both gotta stop jumping on each other right away because sex makes all of this a million times more difficult…you’ve basically bonded yourself to someone before you’ve evaluated whether you should bond yourself to them."
"""Bad Dating advice for young men""   I watched Rocky with my son and daughter when they were older teenagers. The scene where Rocky stops Adrianne from leaving the apartment by putting his arm across the door was one of the most romantic scenes of the 80's. He loves her, she loves him, but she wanted to leave because of her own fear and insecurity. He pushed her boundaries, they fell in love and that became the main story line.  Both my kids felt he had crossed the line, and called it assault and ""kidnapping.""  He had no intention of hurting her but knew she had to get out of her ""comfort zone"" and move forward.  That scene is integral to the movie. Nowadays there would have been no boxing match as Rocky would have been incarcerated that night. Sad that youth cannot see that. And sad that women are seen as victims in every situation."
"Some men told us we have to work on us but we never heard someone told a woman you have to work on you, so they take pity and blame other, the government funds women, forced women to run and tight us on a chair by blaming us to warch the run. And women comes to spit on our face to not get on her standards and men we have to accept that behavior. Why men are divided to not support each other , level up together and help each other"
"Why do these podcasters/influencers/whatever keep bringing on women to talk about men's problems, especially these big names that always get it wrong?"
"Vehemently disagree with you on Family court catastrophising.  I've been through it and fought only for my kids with a severely mentally I'll mother making every false allegation under the sun and they still awarded custody to her and my kids now no-longer speak to either of us.  The fact that the Court would not apply simple decency and consequences for her terrible behavior AND the fact that my experience is demonstrably and consistently repeated through the Wester world, shows a genuine lack of empathy and seriousness about re-promoting marriage."
"Erica seems very knowledgable and intelligent.  It's troubling to hear her speak of government as if it's an entity that has a role to play.  Government is nothing more that millions of individuals (many corrupted and perverse) claiming authority (illegitimate in most cases), and credibility (unwarranted in most cases).  One does not have to be a libertarian to recognize this.  What it does require is for parents, and society to take responsibility and stop wanting someone else to take care of them.  One could argue that part of why we face so many crisis in society results from a mindset of needing to be protected or taken care of (female/infantile trait?) by somebody or something else.  It's one thing to voluntarily take in information, or to take advantage of aligned resources, but it's completely unacceptable to claim authority to dictate.  I find Ericas assertion that individuals in government have the legitimate authority to tell me what I or my children can consume, and at what age.  It's this Erica mindset that delivers us into authoritarianism, and tyranny.  Good intentions or not, she is deranged and delusional, and this is precisely the sort of people we need to prevent from having power."
I like most of what this woman guest is saying except for the part that therapy is the answer for everything. Sounds a little self-serving. Especially for young men therapy is definitely not the answer. Mentorship from other men is what is the answer a young boy needs other men around him to figure out how to be a man.
Tradesmen used to be respected and provided a very good quality of life...they've been utterly broken and disregarded....it's not only at levels of university or college
"It has affected all men. I don’t ever talk to women at work after metoo. And arms length in personal relationships. Being in entertainment, seeing how destructive that pendulum swung as to weaponize women against men, I’m forever changed. Nothing that swings the other way will ever make me trust interaction again. I feel VERY sorry for young boys that went through this."
"Here is your problem - your understanding of hook-up culture and situationships. Hook-up culture and situationships are for successful men, not for the normal guy. A guy with choice will have women stay in situationships since committing to one girl would be a bad choice for him. If you are a woman, and you feel like the guy isn't committing to you, and you describe your relationship as situationship, it's most likely because you are swinging beyond your league. That guy won't ever commit, you are very likely his side-chick and not much more."
"Christianity is the only religion that teaches other-centered behavior. And equality in marriage. That is what has changed in our society. Everyone is narcissistic in relationships. Never what we can do for our spouse, but what they can do for us."
"So enjoyable,  I just loved this discussion,  thank you to you both"
"What Erica explains at 10:05 is important to explain why girls & boys should be separated early in education. I’ve worked with young kids, little boys are more physical due to testosterone & need more physical playtime so they are able to focus better when learning."
"The ONLY reason women ""got ahead"" is there's a huge thumb on the scale.  Take your thumb off the scale.  See what happens."
"Being a therapist doesn't mean she's not a woman.
Caring about women and women's issues doesn't mean one can't reject feminism. Those two things aren't synonymous."

"The advice she's giving here should be directed 100% towards the women: as they decide everything right from the onset of who to ""take to dinner."" 
Men have 0 agency in the decisions women choose or not choose to make."
"The industry that I trained for routinely has networking events for exclusively women, non binary people, lbtq+ people, non white people. I’ve never seen a networking event exclusively for white strait men, not saying that we need it; I’d personally prefer if there was no networking events based on identity, but even in the events that include my identity I feel looked over or outright rejected. Maybe that’s internalized self hatred I’ve developed in my 24 years of living, but goddamn does it feel impossible to be a punching bag anymore especially when the product of a majority of larger companies are outright failing. It feels like I wasn’t given the opportunity, and on top of that the people that where are destroying the future opportunities I could have had."
"I have noticed a marked increase in anger in women, a very large increase! I think they deep down don’t really like how womanhood has changed."
15:53 My friend pulled her son out of Kindergarten because he was so stressed out by all the standardized testing. She home schooled him all the way through. He graduated this year.
"So I am a 56-year-old Christian woman who is married to a retired Air Force officer. We moved all over the country as my girls were growing up and thus became very tight-knit. Both of our girls lived at home with us until they married and moved out on their own, one in her late twenties and one at 30. I arranged my work schedule as a nurse to coordinate with my daughter's schedule when my first granddaughter was born 9 years ago. And that way one of us was always there to care for her so that she did not have to go into daycare. 2 years ago when my grandson was born I retired from the hospital entirely to be the full-time daycare for him and now have an infant granddaughter as well that I take care of. In the fall we will actually be removing my eldest granddaughter from private Christian school and I will begin homeschooling her. I maintain my nursing license should I decide to go on a medical mission trip or something like that, but I feel that I am much more of use to my family than to someone in the general public in a hospital. On top of that we moved my 82 year old mother in with us last year as she was no longer able to live at home alone. And I will not see her in a nursing home. All of this being said I know that quite often the younger generation looks at my daughters as not quite independent because of the direction of their lives. That being said they are both quite independent. Furthermore whenever we come in contact with anyone my age or older they always comment on how blessed they are to have me to help raise their children. And on top of all that, while I am busier than ever, I know that all this keeps me young because it gives me purpose. And my grandchildren are benefiting from constant contact even with their great-grandmother now. I am a big fan of multigenerational living."
I agree with so much of what this woman says but therapy is not the solution. You can’t train therapists that will help with the current schools. Therapy programs are pumping out terrible therapists. She seems to have no idea of how bad the current schools are when it comes to training therapists. I got my masters in clinical mental health and did not learn anything of value
Men got left behind or held back???
"Here’s the thing nobody talks about — even in this conversation. If you consider that most children get a smart phone by age 9 — some much earlier — that means they have access to hardcore porn, anytime, anywhere. This has been enormously damaging to children — especially boys because their bodies and brains are pre-formatted with this interest. Even though they don’t understand it all yet, they’re endlessly curious. They’re doing with their smart phone what we would’ve done at their age. This has raised a whole generation of pervs well before they actually experience the real thing. This has changed their sex lives forever."
2 decades of complete failure will lead nearly anyone to finding new pursuits
She sounds like a great therapist. The only thing I have an issue with is that she's mentoring young men to go into a gynocentric based curriculum and career.
"I've commented similar on other forums about this. I work helping young men (18-24) build confidence, come out of their shell and be able to cope with everything life throws at you and be able to work on their own and in teams.

The majority see no future for themselves. Even if they work every hour they can it isn't enough to have a home and a family. Their girlfriends (If they have one) can't stay home and raise future kids like how their mothers could with them. For almost their whole 20 years on this earth they've been blasted from every angle with ""you're a toxic man, you're racist, you're sexist"" and who knows what else. I've seen 3 young men we work with end up taking their own lives as they feel everything is against them. The majority numb themselves with porn/alcohol/drugs/video games and as a society we are very lucky they do because if they didn't they could case some serious problems. 

We won't ever address the problem head on because it would mean having to deal with some of the big lies we've told ourselves for the past few decades."
This is all good news for handymen.  Lots and lots of women living alone that need things fixed. Men suddenly have value when the kitchen sink is clogged.
"Because of YT censorship there's no way that I or anyone else can actually tell you what you missed, the half truths and the whole lies that were told and I personally am not even allowed to post more than one sentence any more."
"This podcast is the perfect embodiment of reality in general when it comes to discussions about boys and girls or men and women. The sentiment shifts from apathy to derision to blaming to pointless advise on how to become good enough again. 'If only you did well in school and college and became an investment banker and went to the gym and had a nice car and were fairly good looking, you won't be left behind by women and they will want you'. Even voicing the frustrations of one's failure to attract women is classified as being entitled.

I am not accusing either the host or the guest of harbouring any ill will towards men in general. All I am saying is that the way things are is not an aberration, it is the direct consequence of the deliberate choices made by generations to 'empower' women and just human nature. To some extent even those choices couldn't have been any different. We were always going to arrive at this point where we are now. There is a reason why feminism is a global phenomenon while men's rights movements are a fringe internet group. It was always going to be this way. If you were to reset the world and play is all over again, we will again come back to this exact same point because it is built into the human nature."
Feminism gained unstoppable power through a sisterhood and all for one and one for all mentality. That shows no signs of abating.
She basically said said don’t pick the girl that will accuse you of rape for going in for a kiss….. isn’t that like telling a girl not to go after the guy that sexually assaults you. WTF? How do you spot either before being in that situation?
"I've never understood why people can't recognize the link between empathy development and present fathers. Empathy is an inherently selfless act as you're doing what you can to take on the position of someone who might be struggling (Sometimes quite badly) to better understand or help that person. Fathers, by definition, are selfless beings. The act of providing and protecting is selfless. We act in the best interests of others sometimes to great detriment to ourselves. Perhaps I'm just more aware or have a different understanding of this than others, but I wish more people recognized and understood this. Fathers are just as Important as mothers, but rn only one of those roles faces constant attack and neglect of recognition."
"To any guy feeling down about not being able to get involved with a woman, very very few are anything close to relationship material in 2025."

She lost me on the quotas.  DEI - gender version.  Hard pass.
"MeToo war wichtig hat jedoch das Ziel verfehlt. Die Mächtigen haben, wie man jetzt sieht, einfach weitergemacht. Ich bin heute der Meinung, dass der Kollateralschaden viel zu hoch war! Sagt schon viel aus, dass ihre kein Wort über die Kollateralschäden dieser Bewegung sagt."
Am besten ist doch wenn Frauen und Männer gut zusammenleben.
"17:42 ich glaube, dass es weniger die ""Vorurteile"" der Richter/Richterinnen sind, die eine Verurteilung erschweren sondern viel mehr, ein Problem der Nachweisbarkeit besteht (Aussage gegen Aussage, fehlende forensische Beweisaufnahme usw.)."

"Es geht auf jeden fall in die richtige Richtung. Jeder einzelne hat viele verletzungen, von denen wir kol,etiv lernen und aufeinander zugehen können."
"Mir hat mal jemand einen tollen Job als Reiseleiterin auf Kuba angeboten. Dafür hätte ich allerdings mit ihm ins Bett gehen müssen. Ich habe das abgelehnt - und natürlich den Job nicht bekommen.
Mein Fazit ist also, dass viele Frauen mitmachen, weil sie auf der Karriereleiter hochsteigen wollen und das in Kauf nehmen.
Sie könnten aber auch ""nein"" sagen!!!
Vermutlich verkaufen sich ganz viele Leute, um beruflich aufzusteigen - und nicht nur auf sexuelle Art.
Ja, das ist nicht gerecht, aber es ist leider so"
Ich finde bdas sehr gut wenn sich die Frauen wehren finde ich sehr gut weiter so
Sehr viele Incels in den Kommentaren hier 😬

Warum lassen die Frauen sich das gefallen?
"On the Kindle bookshelf is a pretty good book by Valerie Sparkle called Surprise Violations. It has a lot of Me, Too stories from long before the Me, Too movement finally came into being. Glad that these strong folks brought the stories into the forefront, as for so many more years, they have been going on."
all of the women like Oprah Winfrey who KNEW about Weinstein did nothing...and get no criticism...sick
Isn't Twohey the one who smeared Justin Baldoni?

I belong to the: #Touch-Me Movement.
what an evil man !
Yeah all these actresses got on their knees for movie parts on their own. They could have walked out the room.  Today they are all rich too.
Here  is the problem  with  the we too movement  kniw it will hold back women  because  know it will be harder  for women  to get promotion  or get a higher  paying jobs. Know  the work force will be run more  bumy men instead  of a qualified  woman. ...it will hurt  and hold a line that  women  will not be able  to move up the latter. Because  of this movement. ....is not good  for women. ....sorry  to tell you  the truth. ..
#Theme Justin
wart hog....
The make up  hair and clothing folks sexualized the 2 reporters. Young and thin so why not show them off.
#metoo     liberal arrogance
Let's all agree that nobody deserves to be sexually harassed. :)
How does the future belong to one gender? I thought feminism was about equality!
The future isn't female. It's digital.
"Women: My body, my choice.

Men: My wallet, my money."
#MeToo is causing a severe recession in the Golddigging industry.
We the men who support men being abused by women are going to rise and women are going to be held accountable.  Thank you Johnny Depp 😘
Amber Heard has made a mockerey of this movement.
The future is robot sophiea..
MGTOW is Also on The Horizon As Well
I think I'll just stay home and avoid getting too close to anyone forever
"I have never been raped or sexually harraseed or bullied but my support goes to the men and women who have. Lets get rid of predators in power. Men and women who sexually exploit those beneath them. Eventually, the world needs to focus on molestation at the forefront. This is one of  the biggest crime that plagues humanity."
"I'm not a feminist, and this movement ticked me off for various reasons... But as a South African lady, I can confirm that there is a bit problem with domestic abuse towards women in this country."
"I served in the Armed Forces,when in uniform i had my arse felt,crouch,and one woman tried to pull me into a toilet on a train,#hypocrites"
"If i may ask, what does metoo and the phrase ""the future is female"" have in common? The combination makes it look like this is about power."
"According to feminism, both genders are equal... Just that women are more equal."
This move is going to cost up-and-coming marriages for years to come.
The future is AI
where's the virtual reality for how it feels like to be falsely accused?
why is my dishwasher not working
I’m not gonna apologize for something someone I don’t know did.
How valid is a movement if it is abandoned when leaders of the movement go silent when it involves a violator from their own ranks.  It loses its credibility.
"5 years later, men understand to avoid all unnecessary contact with women."
Ita changing the world alright...for the worse...

"We all forget the very purpose of women rights——equality. The future is to be shared by all people regardless of sex, not just male or female."
We avoid women now. It actually makes life easier. 😂👍
I'm so MGTOW
Make life more peaceful and enjoyable.  Just go MGTOW.
"Against me too. Not against women but absolutely amd all the way against me too. Just because it judges the whole male population as one entity,  rather than focusing on the problems caused by some disorderly  individuals. This movement is totally and most important  blindly against half the population of the earth. My stand has changed towards women after that, because I don't know if one specific woman is a supportive or not of this movement. So I don't talk to women,  don't flirt, don't walk close to them, dont  say goodmorning  or hello to any woman, don't ask for help if I see a woman in a store, don't interact at all. In this case the movement 's ideals and standards have neen met and it is absolutely keeping me as a man - that it knows I am as a male a Hazzard to society- away from all the females of this planet.  So yes the future is female and I don't  want to be a part of this  future. Men gowing  their own way, away from women."
As a business owner I will never even consider hiring a woman not worth it
So much of the things they accuse men doing to them happens to men too.

Metoo. Sorry ladies no more sleeping your way to the top.
"Millions of young men recruited for war have died as well. Mostly for the wealthy class owners of the world and mainly for mineral and oil resources. These young men died to protect and secure the rights of their countrymen (and women) to speak out freely for any cause they wished. So, in effect, young men are being taken advantage of and being 'body sold' (trafficked) on a much larger scale and for a much longer period of time because they are existentially expendable to the battle field. Women don't actually have that burden, but they do frequently suffer men's primal instincts as men often suffer theirs, only differently."
"regarding South Afirca, this will achieve nothing"
I like the virtual reality goggles to get the point across.
Is there a VR scenario for women to experience what it's like for men to be abused by his wife?
Best way to deal with women in the workplace is to interact with them as little as possible.
I dont think I can ever return home from Japan.  This country is great. No bs drama and woman here are way more happier.  Both men and woman dont have rediculous life expectations.
"Me Too in a nutshell 30 years ago a man did something I didn't like.... I never said anything about it until now but without evidence, proof, or any fact believe me and punish the man assuming he is guilty and even if he is proven innocent treat him as though he were guilty. Then call everyone who disagrees a misogynist."
"So wait what about the guys who were falsely accused oh wait ""Future is female""."
Jordan Peterson is my hero.
#Metoo and #feminisn ere more negative than positive right now
"The real beauty of all this is that it will show men that they are inherently toxic, and should pursue their passions and livelihood WITHOUT women, so as not to cause them any trouble. 

Womanists, don't even tell me that you are offended by this... or even call me names... If you do either, you may as well admit that you really are NOT strong NOR independent.. and that you DO need men... and having those beliefs is misogynistic. Thank you."
You just have to understand that I want to live in an equal society. The movement started because women need respect . Just never become what you fight.
Metoo has made it so complicated and risky for man and women to work together that it is better to segregate them at workplace
Movements come and they go as always.
2:23 why does she seem so proud and happy to be talking about this.
"All the comments are encouraging on here, it's great to seethe majority see through the metoo movement and their lies, thank you!!"
"Blue: afraid, deluded, and controlled 
Red: fearless dawg, reality, and a warrior"
this movement threatens the song baby it’s cold outside
The future isn't women it's a robot's flying cars and stuff like that
Me Too has affected the lifes of a thousand men at most but harmed the potential career prospects of over a hundred thousand women.
GREAT I WANT GENDER SEGREGATION AT WORK. I HOPE IT WILL START SOON
"The card board sign should read:

Jordan Peterson is controversial? Really? So what exactly is controversial about him? When you accuse someone with that heavy words you should be able to back it up.
"Wow, they are putting VR reprogramming devices on the faces of men now? I worked in education for many years. Female dominated industry. I have been flashed by a female coworker because i wouldn't feel how perky her breasts were. Two female bosses would walk up and rub my back while grading papers, comment on my muscles. Refused a coworkers advances on a few occasions, one would end up stalking me for over a month. She would sit in my truck leave notes, spray perfume etc. She even said she was going to kill herself over the situation; this particular situation happened in the early 90s just as companies were adopting sexual harassment training policies. So, I'm gonna sit through the rest of this video and role my eyes, thank you very much"
the lady says u can’t do work if u can’t have a 1 on 1 meeting but now u literally can’t look at a girl for 5 seconds
"If men express themself emotionally they will get exploited by woman whenever its beneficial to them and at the same time get told they should hate themself as men for being a man....masculinity is a male choice for us to accept as it is and how we choose to be, if not expressing myself is part of masculinity then it should be my choice and be left to it."
How come they never interviewed the accused for their side of the story .
Im am so grateful that my country doesn't have this problem...why? Because we're too busy dealing with floods and economic crisis which looks way BETTER than whatever this is
WE ARE NOT OVARY ACTING IS GENIUS
"Hmm interesting to see the massive dislikes and critical comments. In my opinion, it should start with education system. Fix that before attempting other fixes. I am glad that companies taking harassments more serious now than before so this is a good start."
Good job. This fund had successfully tightened the relationship among people from the high and low social classes

"Thanks for producing this content, it is appreciated. The Economist’s comment section seems to be one of the most vitriolic I’ve seen, for some reason.  Kudos for this reporting, not all of us here are haters."
"You know I’m happy about this. But I hope it won’t get out of hand. Also we always overlook that men can also be assaulted sexually, but so can women and they dominate that area which we need to change."
"It doesn't just happen in the workplace, the harrassment also happens in one's personal life.  Never hug or touch a person unless they have agreed to it."
Who else was here to read the comments about people saying #metoo?
proud of every single woman speaking up! i believe you. i will always believe you!!❤️
"How about using hijab,.or convert to Islam, even better.    Learn about how Islam ruling about man and woman should/must behave toward each other, But please not from biassed media."
western world is wierd
Let's  use a dramatization of a situation to change things with this Virtual Reality product that will make men understand what only women see. Ok sure...
The disconnect in the #MeToo movement is that many (if not all) of the female Hollywood actors who initially came forward to protest sexual harassment and sexual assault at the hands of Hollywood producers and directors were perfectly content to allow themselves to be sexually objectified on screen in exchange for large sums of cash.  Is it altogether surprising then that these women were treated as sexual objects by the same men who paid them in the first place?   Women can't both use their sexuality as a means to get what they want from men and then at the same time expect that men will not look at and treat them as sexual objects.
"Grats feminists 

You’ve completely cancelled human interaction altogether 

Hope your happy :)"
"Remember, Ego's, we have masculine and feminine inside of each and everyone of us; in past lives you have been both. The rising of women does not mean the fall of men, maybe monsters but if your not one of them you have nothing to worry about. The healthy masculine without insecurities of his own power will never feel the need to put someone below himself, he will not be afraid of having his other half in an empowered state. Thank you Lilith, Kali Ma, Mother Mary, and Lord Sananda and all the brave sisters and brothers of humanity that are stepping into the light of truth and justice. I bless all ignorant, asleep beings who can't see the need for this movement with pure love and light, with pure source consciousness, with balanced feminine and masculine energy. ♡♥♡♥"
"At, my health club, I've watched, men walk away from women, the women want to be noticed by the men, but the men will leave, women standing alone, in an area, of the gym and return when the woman leaves,"
When are women ever happy?
"Apparently not a single man has ever been sexually assaulted or harassed according to this narrative, what a relief, I suppose it must have been another ""Misogynistic"" hallucination of memory"
"Do we still need feminism? Yes.
Do we need feminism in developed countries like America? Absolutely not."
"I've been harrassed 10 times worse than that! My whole goddamn office has been abusive to me a lot of days, more than I can count. I'm the one doing most of the work, and they talk the most shit! There's no such thing as justice in this world. U have to make your own!"
MGTOW is the last hope
I hope that all fake-accusers will be sentenced and punished.
"It's not hard, seriously its common sense.  Men and women, would you be happy if your son or daughter or sister or friend was being treated as your talking to your co-worker, then go ahead. If not change  that behaviour"
"For starters she's way overdone the makeup which women use to attract men while at the same time calling a mans attention to her harassment. Women are truly illogical with their emotions switching by the minute and of course are ALWAYS the victim.Men won't put their hands up and say ""Ok ladies you win"" Experienced men know how to play a woman that lets her think she's in charge and so the age old game will go on and all this bullshit will only appeal to the idiots who suck it up."
"#youtoo, me? I stand up for myself."
Why respecting is not taught in schools😤
These women should think about their sons.
How about we tell women they need to man up and start talking to men and risk being rejected.
Pure propaganda
"The idea that ""we don't know what the rules are"" is total bs. Treating people with respect shouldn't come as a surprise."
"I think that some things are being mixed here. I totally agree with the right of women to not being sexually harassed, and I think men who do such things are not real men. However I don't see why the video also want to speak about the gender disparity in positions of power. I remember Jordan Peterson saying something about this issue, which is: there has been plenty of time for women to reach positions of power, and yet there is this gender gap there. I don't think that women are less capable intellectually or anything, but I do think that men and women are different. There's no such thing as the ""right to be in a position of power"", because, by definition of power, that's not how it works. There might be rules of course, written or not written, but I don't think gender distinction should be done to favor one or the other.


Clearly this is a lot (infinitely) more complicated than this, and obviously I think it's good that women speak up about untold harassment."
"This man : ""it's the suspicion of men that is clearly not in anyone's interest"" SORRY, you mean in MENS interest."" This man gives off big :  oh no ... the consequences of my actions vibes"

I hate this war of women vs men. We all have our unique strifes.

"Hätte nie gedacht, dass ich jemals eine Diskussion zwischen Silvi Carlsson, Desirée Nick und Ulf Poschardt sehe😅"
"Ich finds nach wie vor schade, dass das ZDF 13 Fragen nicht im Fernsehen ausstrahlt. Meiner Meinung nach eines der besten Diskussionsformate in Deutschland, regt mich immer wieder zum nachdenken an."
"Da wurde mir dann doch noch mal bewusst, in welcher Bubble ich mich befinde. Konnte das Video noch nicht ganz anschauen, weil ich mich soooo getriggert fühle. Das ist eine Klatsche ins Gesicht, was Desiree von sich gibt."
"""Ich identifiziere mich nicht als privilegiert"" war mein Favorit. Sie ist wahrscheinlich Millionärin die in der Öffentlichkeit steht. Wenn die nicht privilegiert ist was ist dann der Großteil der Gesellschaft"
"Silvi war ganz stark. Ich finde es so stark, dass sie als Betroffene so viel Contenence bei so viel Whataboutism, Ablenkung und mangelnder Empathie auf der anderen Seite halten kann. Ich bin in Gedanken bei allen Betroffenen, die dieses Video gucken und sich zurecht getriggert und nicht gehört fühlen! Ich glaube euch!"
"Hahaha, ich musste laut auflachen als die Schauspielerin meinte ""Jede Frau kann sagen ... bitte rufen sie mein Management an!"" Die ist sowas von weltfremd die glaubt jede Frau in der Arbeitswelt hat ein Management Team!"
"Es ist so einfach zu sagen ""ja lass es doch einfach nicht zu"". So einfach ist das nicht. Ich bin an sich ein sehr selbstbewusster Mensch jedoch ist mir das Blut in den Adern gefroren als mir jemand so zu nahe kam, ich habe mich so überrumpelt gefühlt, da kommt einem kaum in den Sinn sich in dem Moment zu behaupten. Da will man einfach nur weg und mit niemandem darüber reden."
"Mich hat die Me-too-Bewegung vor allem in dem Sinne beeinflusst, dass ich die Erfahrungen, die ich gemacht habe, nicht mehr selbst herunterspiele (war vielleicht gar nicht so schlimm, vielleicht bin ich zu empfindlich, meine Gefühle diesbezüglich sind evtl übertrieben).
Zu sehen, dass andere Personen es genauso bewerten wie mein inneres Gefühl hat mich bestärkt, den Mund aufzumachen.
Und als ich mich getraut habe, hat mein Arbeitgeber mich auch ernst genommen und vorbildlich gehandelt 👍🏻"
"Ich finde es ebenfalls realitätsfern von Frau Nick einfach davon auszugehen, dass alle anderen Menschen die gleiche Handlungsstruktur besitzen, wie sie nach außen. Ich bezweifle, dass sie in jeder SItuation in der Lage ist, sich zu wehren, sich abzugrenzen, ""einfach zu gehen"". Es wird immer jemanden geben, der die eigenen Grenzen nicht nur übertreten kann, sondern sie auch mit Gewalt eintritt. Das Glück gehabt zu haben, dies - auch wieder nach außen - nie erfahren haben zu müssen, vor allem als Frau, ist ein Privileg. Das ist nicht die Norm, das ist die Ausnahme. Und auch steckt dahinter keine Stärke, kein Mehrwert im eigenen Handeln, sondern einfach pures fucking Glück."
"Meine Erfahrung als 15 jährige Ferial-Praktikantin: Juniorchef um die 30 machte immer wieder Komplimente, die man lächelnd und unsicher annahm, dann einen Klaps auf den Po beim vorbeigehen, Einladungen zu Wein, die ich dankend ablehnte. 

Ich hab das nebenbei bei meinen Eltern erwähnt und war verwundert, dass mein Vater sofort zur Geschäftsleitung ging und ich dort nicht mehr arbeiten durfte. 

Erst Jahre später hab ich begriffen, dass genau dieses Verhalten des Juniorchefs übergriffig war. Und in kleinster weiße irgendwie entschuldbar."
"Ich habe mal als Flugbegleiterin gearbeitet und was ich da im Cockpit und bei Overnights so an sexueller Belästigung, unangenehmen Gesprächen, Missbrauch von Hierarchie usw. erlebt habe finde ich aus meiner heutigen Sicht absolut krass. Damals fand ich es auch unangenehm, aber ich konnte es nicht richtig einordnen und hab alles immer versucht schlagfertig zu kontern etc. Wenn ich das mal nicht geschafft habe, hab ich teilweise die Schuld bei mir gesucht, weil ich so ""unlocker"" bin. Heute würde ich solchen Situationen ganz anders begegnen, aber wenn man jung ist, dann hat man dieses Standing einfach noch nicht. Es muss noch einiges passieren, aber bitte ohne Krampf und die ständige Angst etwas falsches zu machen oder Männern generell keinerlei ""typisch männlichen Attribute"" zuzugestehen."
"Die Meinung von Desiree Nick finde ich sehr realitätsfern. Ich wurde von 18 bis 20 als duale Studentin in einem Hotel regelmäßig von meinem Chef (Ende 30) in Gesprächen am Arm festgehalten, während dem Sitzen an den Schultern massiert, für eine viel zu lange Zeit umarmt. Ich hatte dadurch das Gefühl, dass er seine Macht über mich demonstrieren wollte, was er auch geschafft hat. In diesen Situationen bin ich komplett handlungsunfähig gewesen, obwohl ich sonst eine Person bin, die sehr stark für sich einsteht. Da es in diesem Hotel keinen höheren Vorgesetzten, Betriebsrat oder ähnliches gegeben hat, an den ich mich hätte wenden können, blieb mich letztendlich nicht anderes als die Kündigung um mich dieser Situation zu entziehen. 
Das ganze ist jetzt zwei Jahre her und wenn ich mal über diese Erfahrung spreche, kommt mir oft Unverständnis entgegen. 
Von Personen wie Desiree Nick zu hören sich ""einfach nicht der Situation auszusetzen"" finde ich daher einfach nur schade.

Edit: Da es ja anscheinend sehr viele Meinungen mit SEHR vieler freier Interpretation zu meiner Situation gibt, konkretisiere ich das: Mein Chef war meines Erachtens ein Narzist. Nach meiner Kündigung hat er bis zu meinem letzten Arbeitstag nicht mehr mit mir gesprochen, mir nicht in die Augen gesehen, mir unschöne Aufgaben (Fugen der Hotelbadezimmer mit Zahnbürsten schrubben) erteilen lassen. In anderen Diskussionen (Mangel der Ausbildung, Arbeitssicherheit) zeigte er keinerlei Selbstreflexion oder Einsicht. Ich bin mir daher sicher, dass ich mit der Ansprache, dass ich dieser Berührungen nicht möchte, nichts positives erreicht hätte. 

ZUDEM hat er mich so stark festgehalten, dass danach Abdrücke am Arm zu sehen waren. Das war kein ""ich fasse meine Mitarbeiterin kurz freundschaftlich an, das empfindet sie bestimmt auch so"", sondern ein bewusst hartes zugreifen. Die Umarmungen waren entweder seitlich oder von hinten, es war nie so, als ob ich diese erwidert hätte oder gar von mir ausgingen. Ich musste ihn siezen, er duzte mich. Es gab keinerlei freundschaftliche Beziehung zwischen uns, die ein anfassen gerechtfertigt hätte. Selbst wenn das nicht der Fall gewesen wäre, hat ein Mensch bei einem Machtgefälle die Hände bei sich zu lassen. 

Und zur Erinnerung:  hier geht es um echte Menschen mit individuellen Erfahrungen, Charakterzügen und Emotionen. Eine Ferndiagnose ist nicht erwünscht. Wer nichts nettes zu meiner Erfahrung zu sagen hat, kann das gerne dem nächst gelegenen Baum erzählen :)"
"""Und daher möchte ich die Frauen bitten, sich dem ganzen nicht zur Verfügung zu stellen"" Bitte was? Wie sehr möchte man bitte sexuelle Übergriffe verharmlosen. Ich bin wirklich schockiert."
"Ich habe viele sexistische und sexuelle Übergriffe erlebt - vorallem aber in meinen Aushilfsjobs, bei denen ich das austauschsbarste Glied in der Kette war. Und ich kann berichten: egal wie oft ein übergriff stattgefunden hat, jedes mal war ich wie gelehmt. All die Schlagfertigkeit die mir sonst zugesprochen wurde, ist verschwunden. 

Ich habe mal als Kellnerin in einem Club gearbeitet. Standard Mainstreamschuppen. Als ich gerade Getränke auf dem Tisch abstellen wollte, griff mir ein Gast von hinten in den Schritt. Ich schoss hoch, schlug die Hand weg, konnte noch den Kopf schütteln und ging weg. Es ist nunmal nicht so, dass man sich auf so einen übergriff vorbereiten kann und dann Karate auspackt. Meine Schockreaktion war Flucht. Ich ging zum Türsteher um den Mann rausschmeißen zu lassen. Der Türsteher sagte zu mir ""naja Mäuschen, das kann schonmal passieren, das solltest du aushalten können, die menschen trinken hier eben"". Weil mir also von dem menschen, der mir helfen sollte nicht weitergeholfen wurde, ging ich zum Schichtleiter. Der meinte dann, die seien eben betrunken, so sei das in Clubs, ich hätte mich letztens schon beschwert weil mir einer zu nah gekommen sei und ich solle mich nicht so haben. Das großzügige Angebot vom Schichtleiter war dann noch dass ich den Tisch an einen Kollegen abgeben durfte. Dieser tat dann so als sei nichts gewesen. 

Mir wurde nicht geholfen, ich wurde nicht gehört. Ich wusste ich war nicht schuld, ich hatte einfach nur Getränke an einen Tisch gebracht. Mir wurde suggeriert ich wäre das problem, ich wäre anstrengend. Übrigens bin ich trotzdem zur nächsten Schicht erschienen. Ich brauchte den Job bis ich etwas neues hatte. Ich war angewiesen auf diese traurigen 8 euro die Stunde.

Ganz generell bin  ich selbstbewusst und bin ich Schlagfertig. Aber es geht um teils traumatische Situationen die oft schneller vorbei sind als man sie einordnen kann.

Silvi bleibt ruhig, wo ich nicht hätte ruhig bleiben können. Was die Nick da zum Teil von sich gibt konnte ich nicht glauben."
"Wie kann man als Frau dort stehen und den Frauen die Schuld daran geben, belästigt zu werden, weil sie es nicht geschafft haben ""ihr Berufs- und Privatleben zu trennen""!?! Dass Frau Nick sich nicht in Grund und Boden schämt..."
"Jede Frau kann einfach nein sagen... 
In den Situationen in denen ich noch sprechen konnte bevor ich dissoziiert bin, wurde mein nein mutwillig übergangen und ignoriert. Egal wie laut und deutlich es war, ob ich aus vollem Hals geschrien oder nur noch vor mich hin gewimmert habe.
Auch habe ich mich in vielen Situationen körperlich gewehrt. Sicherlich konnten damit einige Menschen aufgehalten werden... aber halt leider nicht alle.
Ich bin weder körperlich schwach noch habe ich zu wenig Selbstbewusstsein. 
Trotzdem wurde ich mehrfach sexuell belästigt und vergewaltigt. 
Aber danke für die Tipps, das nächste mal werde ich einfach nein sagen und mich nicht in die Opferposition begeben."
Ich finde Desiree Nick absolut Respektlos und Verständnisslos gegenüber Menschen die nicht in ihrer Position sind.
"Frau Nick spielt ihre altbekannte Rolle. Wie immer mehr schlecht als recht, weil man bei ihr immer deutlich merkt, wie wenig dahinter steckt. Das macht eine ernsthafte Diskussion mit ihr unmöglich."
"Allerherzlichsten Dank an Caroline Rosales, Silvi Carlsson und Fikri Anil Altintas. Klasse, bin ich froh, um eure Arbeit."
"44:58 ""Was nicht passieren darf, ist dass man es zur Sache der Frauen macht. Das ist grotesk. Es ist das Thema der Männer.""
Ich finde, dass ist ein sehr wichtiger Punkt."
"Ich stimme den Kommentaren hier zu, dass es nicht immer so leicht ist nein zu sagen. Darüberhinaus wird einem häufig auch gar nicht die Möglichkeit gegeben sich irgendwie zu äußern, sondern man wird in einer oder mehreren Hinsichten unterdrückt und da raus zu kommen ist um einiges schwerer, weil dir nicht zugehört wird. Ich finde es schade, dass dieses Argument so groß zu sein scheint. Wenn dich jemand beispielsweise sexuell belästigt, gibt dir die Person in vielen Fällen gar nicht erst die Chance überhaupt nein zu sagen geschweige denn irgendeine Entscheidung zu treffen ob du einverstanden bist mit dem was passiert. Da fällt diese Frage ""Warum sagst du denn nicht nein?"" vollkommen weg. Es gibt Übergriffe aller Art in allen Bereichen wo du lange Zeit gar nicht die Chance bekommst ja oder nein zu sagen.
Außerdem, wie schon oft betont wurde: warum müssen wir lernen in übergriffigen Situationen noch lauter nein zu sagen? Sollten nicht lieber Menschen in Machtpositionen etc. lernen sich gar nicht erst übergriffig zu verhalten?"
"Ein Kern Punkt ist, dass viele Menschen ""Priviligierung"" als Vorwurf ansehen und vor Allem Männer meinen, dass sie etwas dafür könnten. Darum geht es nicht. Es geht um ein Bewusstsein in was für einer Situation man sich befindet und daran zu arbeiten, dass sich was ändert. Nehmt das nicht als Front gegen Euch persönlich, gefrontet könnt ihr nur werden, wenn Ihr nix draus macht."
"Alle schreiben hier Desiree ist tough und selbstbewusst.. klar, kann sie ja für sich sein. Aber ich finde es absolut nicht fair von sich auf andere zu schließen, gerade da es in dieser Debatte eben NICHT um Menschen in ihrer Position geht. Ihre Aussagen in dieser Sendung sind ein Schlag ins Gesicht all derer Frauen, die anders als sie leider keine andere Wahl hatten.

Abgesehen davon, finde ich den Rest, den sie hier angesprochen hat richtig und gut!"
"Am Ende des Tages wollen wir doch alle in einer Gesellschaft leben, wo man sich sicher fühlen kann und Spaß haben kann... egal welches Geschlecht... ich hoffe wir schaffen dies irgendwann für alle möglich zu machen!"
"es ist halt zu undifferenziert zu behaupten, dass man ja einfach nein sagen könnte. Wenn man Jahre lang studiert hat und dann endlich einen Job hat, den man auch machen will und mag und dann jemand, der über dir steht, dir dein Leben zur Hölle machen kann und dich im schlimmsten Fall sogar entlassen kann, dich anmacht o.ä. sollte man nicht den Frauen ein geändertes Verhalten abverlangen, sondern denjenigen, die in diesen Machtpositionen sind."
"Es tut mir so unendlich Leid,ich schaue seit 6 Minuten,aber sehe es nicht ein,mich weiter von Desirée Nick anschreien zu lassen. Ihre ersten zwei Aussagen,zeigen mir schon,dass dies ein hofflungsloser Fall ist..wer zum Teufel dachte,es wäre eine gute Idee so jemanden bei so einem Thema einzuladen???"
"Ich habe es zu Hauf erlebt in meinem Beruf als Sekretärin, dass ich von Männern einfach angefaßt wurde oder auf übelste Art und Weise ""angemacht"" wurde, obwohl ich keinerlei Anstalten gemacht hatte, was auf Zuspruch oder Aufforderung meinerseits hätte gewertet werden können. Und wenn ein Vorgesetzter mir einfach seine Hand auf den Po legt, dann ist das ja bereits geschehen, also das mißbräuchliche Verhalten hat schon stattgefunden. Ich kann dann zwar noch sagen: ""unterlassen Sie das"" oder andere Sachen, nur PASSIERT ist es dann bereits, sprich meine Sicherheitszone ist dann bereits verwundet worden."
"Konnte die Folge leider nicht vollständig schauen, weil mich die Aussagen von Desirée Nick unfassbar getriggert haben. Einfach nur respektlose und realitätsferne Aussagen."
"Silvi, gut, dass wir dich haben!"
"Ich finde Silvie sehr stark. Desiree Nick hingegen hat nichts zu sagen und ich hab das Gefühl, sie will nur spalten."
"Man merkt wieder einmal, Frau Nick lebt in ihrer eigenen Welt. Mittlerweile denke ich, dass es wirklich hoffnungslos ist mit ihr eine vernünftige Diskussion zu führen. Sie ist so fern ab von allem, was irgendwen anderen außer ihr betrifft. Kann ihr Management ihr nicht bitte mal erzählen, was für einen Schwachsinn sie von sich gibt. Da kann man ja kaum zuhören ohne auszurasten..."
Ganz stark von Silvie! 👏
"Na klar, JEDE FRAU hat die Möglichkeit zu sagen: ""bitte rufen Sie mein Management an"". Sicher, ich fange als 16jährige auf dem Dorf in einer Bäckerei an und mein Chef wird übergriffig. Frau Nick will mir jetzt sagen, ich betrachte das Verhältnis einfach nicht als rein professionell, der Mann könnte ja auch mein Gärtner sein, ich wäre nicht selbstbewusst genug und um so besser, wenn mir der Mann gefällt. Völliger Realitätsverlust."
"Emotionale Diskussion - ich finde es super, dass die Standpunkte und Menschen, die diskutieren, sehr vielseitig sind. Die Moderation ist super und ich glaube, dass solche Formate sehr wichtig und bereichend sind. 

Miteinander sprechen, auch wenn man nicht auf einer Seite steht :)"
"Ich möchte nur anmerken: die Bilder fast aller Kameras waren angenehm ruhig, bis auf die der Kamera, die die Naheinstellungen der Personen auf dem grünen Feld aufnahm. Ihre Bilder waren mir störend und ablenkend verwackelt. Da habe ich mir mehr Ruhe in der Kameraführung gewünscht."
Silvis Gesichtsausdruck bei min 8:18 widerspiegelt einfach genau meinen HAHAHAH
"Desiree Nick ist so respektlos da fällt mir nichts mehr ein, aber das sehe ich bei vielen Menschen ihrer Generation und das ist sehr schade."
"Warum muss Desiree Nick  so laut und aggressiv reden? Ich sehe dieses Format so gerne und habe bis jetzt alle Themen gesehen, aber noch niemand ist so unangenehm wie diese Frau aufgefallen... Sie kann sich überhaupt nicht in die Frauen hineinversetzen, die in manchen Situationen hilflos sind und nicht wissen wie sie reagieren sollen und vor allem können..."
"Ich denke, dass es eher die Seltenheit ist, wenn eine Frau solche Erfahrungen nicht gemacht hat."
"@13 Fragen, ich finde ihr macht eine Super Sendung und ihr leistet damit echt einen wichtigen Beitrag gegen die Spaltung in der Gesellschaft. Könntet ihr mal ein Video zum Thema Psychiatrie machen? Z.B, ob schneller eingewiesen werden sollte, oder ob Zwangsmaßnahmen verboten werden sollten!? Arbeite selber in dem Bereich und habe da viele spannende Diskussion schon zu erlebt.Liebe Grüße"
"Als junger Mann bin ich tatsächlich immer sehr schockiert von sowas zu hören, dass Frauen ggf. sogar ihren Job verlieren könnten, wenn sie bei sowas nicht mit mache. Ich habe auch von Kommilitoninnen öfter z.B. Berichte über Catcalling gehört, was ja ebenfalls gesellschaftliche Verhältnisse widerspiegelt. Ich finde es auch gut, dass ganz allgemein solche Themen jetzt öffentlich(er) diskutiert werden, was vorher so nicht der Fall war.

Ich glaube aber daran, dass in der langen Frist sich die Gesellschaft dahingehend ändern wird, viele in meinem Alter, ich bin jetzt Anfang 22, sind generell für solche Sachen sensibilisiert und würden solche Dinge als Chef gar nicht mehr zustande kommen lassen. Dass Frauen für ihre Rechte eintreten, auch wenn leider nicht jede Frau dazu in der Lage ist, würde diesen Prozess natürlich erheblich beschleunigen.

Ich hoffe in gewisser Weise auch, ohne jetzt genauere Zahlen zu kennen, dass heute, also 2020+, sowas generell nicht mehr so oft vorkommt, viele Berichte und Erfahrungen dazu bezogen sich auf Dinge, die vor min. 5, teilweise erheblich mehr Jahren passiert sind und erst jetzt die Frauen dazu bereit waren darauf aufmerksam zu machen, sowas generell vielleicht heute sowas nicht mehr so oft stattfindet. Auch wenn jeder einzelne Fall natürlich einer zu viel ist.

Generell sollte man nur, dass musste ich z.B. in solche Diskussionen leider auch lernen, man wird auch als Mann teilweise in eine Aggressoren Rolle gedrängt, so geframed, als sei man selbst auch Teil des Problems. Rein strukturell mag das der Fall sein, ja, aber es trifft halt nicht auf jeden Einzelnen zu.
Ich für meinen Teil wähle z.B. gezielt den Beruf des Lehrers, weil ich weiß, dass hier solche Chef-Mitarbeiterin-Konstellation einfach nicht wirklich auftritt, sowas wie Geschäftsessen zwischen jungen Lehrerinnen und Direktoren wären mir z.B. neu. Und das, ohne mich jetzt in eine Opferrolle schieben zu wollen, die in keinem Verhältnis zu der Rolle der Frauen steht, ist halt einfach wirklich scheiße, wenn man halt Vorwürfe an den Kopf geschmissen bekommt und sich eigentlich nur denkt ""Was habe ich jetzt konkret damit zu tun? Ich war bisher noch in keiner Machtposition, werde es als Lehrer ggü. Kolleginnen einfach nicht sein, will ich auch gar nicht, und Schülerinnen leiden unter dem gleichen Machtgefälle, wie ihre Mitschüler, mal von sexualisierter Gewalt die von einzelnen Lehrern ausgeht abgesehen."""
"Wie unsympathisch willst du sein?
Desiree Nick: Ja!"
Schon komisch das der Altersunterschied der gelben und grünen Seite so hoch ist. Vielleicht ist da ja doch ein Zusammenhang zwischen der Meinung und dem Alter
Wieso fragt man Desiree überhaupt… diese Frau lebt so fernab von Realität und empathielos
"Ich glaube, was sich verändert hat, ist, dass viele Menschen sich in sozialen Rahmen eher trauen, Erfahrungen zu teilen, juristisch ist meiner Meinung nach überhaupt nichts passiert. Was ich allerdings auch oft erlebe, ist, dass gerade Männer unglaublich krass auf solche Erfahrungsberichte reagieren und sofort auf den Begriff ""Rufmord"" kommen"
"Einfach DANKE an Caroline Rosales, Fikri Anıl Altıntaş und Silvi Carlsson!!!!"
"Falls es niemandem ab Minute 39:21 aufgefallen ist, Desiree Nick ist nur nicht nach vorne gekommen, da die Moderatorin das Wort „Anfang“ falsch ausgesprochen hat und man gemerkt hat, dass Desiree dies zweimal versucht hat zu korrigieren. 
Natürlich in Ordnung ein Wort zu korrigieren, jedoch denke ich dass die Moderatorin sich bewusst ist,dass das Wort „Anfang - Anfang“ heißt und nicht „Amfang“. 
Sehr unterschwellig von der Frau Nick."
"Frau Nick hat offensichtlich ihr Selbstbewusstsein mit der Muttermilch aufgesogen. Es gibt jedoch Frauen, die dieses Privileg nicht hatten...
Ernsthaft, ich verstehe, was sie meint, jedoch fehlt mir hier (wieder mal) ihre Einsicht, dass nicht jede Frau so charakterfest, so stark in der Widerrede ist bzw. in der Lage ist, sich verbal & körperlich zu wehren. Es gibt Situationen, wo frau vollkommen überfordert, weil überfahren wird...
Ich, ich, ich.... So relevant kann ihre Meinung hier nicht sein, es geht auch um Empathie."
"Was ich schwer zu greifen finde ist wo fängt victim blaming an und wo der juristische Unschuldsgedanke des Angeschuldigten? Nicht jede Anschuldigung ist wahr. Kommt dieses erst zu spät heraus entsteht für tatsächlich betroffene Frauen ein noch größerer Schaden, den es wird ihnen dann noch mehr Misstraut als aktuell, was wiederum in noch mehr Leid für sie endet."
"Ich glaube die MeToo-Bewegung soll vor allem das Thema sensibilisieren und wie Silvi sagt auch zu Empathie führen. 
Zumindest würde ich mir das wünschen, dass Personen in Machtpositionen selbst nun mehr darüber nachdenken, wann sie (bewusst oder auch unbewusst) ihre Macht missbrauchen, Angestellte einengen und zu dem Entschluss kommen, dass bestimmte Verhaltensweisen daher nicht angebracht sind.  Im gleichen Zuge wünsche ich mir durch mehr Sensibilität auch Unterstützung von Kolleg*innen in akuten Situationen - sexistische Kommentare und Handlungen sollten direkt als solche benannt und kritisiert werden, wenn man sie als Bystander mitbekommt. Menschen müssen lernen, dass bereits sexistische Äußerungen absolut unangebracht und respektlos sind. 

Mehr Empathie wünsche ich mir auch - es sollte darum gehen die Notlage von Betroffenen anzuerkennen und diese nicht mit Vorwürfen zu überschütten oder gar dort die Verantwortung zu suchen. Täter*innen ist egal, ob man ""nein"" sagt oder es signalisiert - wer seine Macht bis zu so einem Vorfall ausnutzt, wird sie weiter ausnutzen (""Wer wird dir schon glauben?"")...."
Gott es ist kaum auszuhalten was die Desiree spricht 🙈 absolut fern jeglicher Realität.
"Im Grunde ist doch die Frage, ob juristisch und gesellschaftlich die Unschuldsvermutung gelten soll. Ich bin der Meinung, man sollte empathisch gegenüber Allen sein und als außenstehende Person im Zweifel einfach neutral bleiben. Vorverurteilungen und Selbstjustiz in egal welche Richtung ist schwachsinnig."
"Desiree sagt, sie könne ja Privatleben von Berufsleben trennen. Aber in der Diskussion geht es doch gerade darum, was ist, wenn es zB dein Vorgesetzter nicht kann/will. Wenn er sich einer Angestellten aufdrängt, obwohl sie alles rein professionell halten will. Was mache ich dann? Ich glaube, nicht jeder ist in der Position zu sagen „Na hören Sie mal, werden Sie mal nicht frech“ oder „Pah, dann geh ich jetzt einfach“, dann ist der Job vielleicht weg. Und nicht jeder kann das verkraften."
"Ich finde die Diskussion sehr gut geführt und super interessant und wichtig !
So gut wie jede Partei hat super argumentiert. Jedoch fand ich Desire schrecklich unpassend. Evtl weil ich sie nach ihrem Sommerhaus der Stars Auftritt nicht erst nehmen kann in so einer wichtigen Diskussion, da sie einfach in einer privilegierten Bubble lebt und nur Ich-bezogen sich hier dargestellt hat."
Sieht für mich stark danach aus das Me too auch ein Generationen Thema ist. Ist zumindest auffällig das die jungen Leute auf einer und die älteren auf der anderen Seite stehen.
"Beim Bachelor Format ist es doch so, dass Frauen sich selbstbestimmt anmelden, um, um einen Mann zu kämpfen und sich im TV zu zeigen. Wo passt der Vergleich denn in die Metoo Debatte? Das verstehe ich leider nicht :( desweiteren fühle ich sehr mit Silvi mit."
"""Die Kardashians haben die Welt verändert und sind glaube ich meilen weiter..."" 😂hat sie das wirklich gesagt? Mein Gedanke dazu: Nein, einfach nur nein😆🤦🏽‍♂️"
"Frauen sollten viel mehr für sich und ihre Prinzipien einstehen. Ich selber schließe mich da nicht aus. Ich musste dies auch erst lernen, dass ich bestimme, wo es lang geht. Das heißt nicht, das Straftaten und sexuelle Belästigung verharmlost werden sollten. Ich wünsche aber mehr Frauen das Selbstbewusstsein von Frau Nick oder Silvi. Denn ich kann mich durchaus durchsetzen, aber im öffentlichen Raum sich zu positionieren finde ich beeindruckend!

Ich möchte nochmal unterstreichen, dass ich natürlich gegen Victim blaming bin. Nur, wenn nicht wir Frauen ganz klar die Grenze ziehen, wer tut es dann für uns!?"
"Bin so froh, dass Samra auch in dem Zusammenhang genannt wurde, habe sehr oft das Gefühl, dass er nicht als Täter und vor allem Nika nicht als Opfer anerkannt werden."
"Die Nick kann man sich auch echt nicht mehr geben. Ich habe das mal als Selbstbewusstsein gesehen, es ist aber meiner Meinung nach nur noch Arroganz. Ich finde, Silvi hat ihre Meinung stark und respektvoll vertreten und man sieht ihr an, wie schwer ihr das teilweise fällt. Der Kontrast zwischen den beiden ist beeindruckend und zeigt, auf was für ein Niveau man manchmal trifft, wenn man über diese Themen sprechen will."
"Danke, dass ihr diesem Thema eine Plattform gebt! 💙"
"Ich bin durch das Video noch nicht komplett durch, mir fehlt aber eindeutig die Rolle der Männer. Gerade in der ersten Hälfte geht es viel darum, wie sich Betroffene verhalten und ihre Erfahrungen nach außen tragen. Diese Themen sind natürlich sehr wichtig, hier hat sich bereits etwas getan und es muss noch mehr geschehen, keine Frage.
Aber die Tatsache, dass nicht erwähnt wird, dass das übergreifende Verhalten der Männer das Hauptproblem ist, finde ich ein wenig schade. Unsere Gesellschaft, die über unangebrachte Kommentare noch mit ""Männer halt"" reagiert, ist doch eigentlich das Hauptproblem und hier hat sich meiner Meinung nach trotz #metoo noch gar nichts getan.

Wie immer super interessantes Video!"
"Klar hat Desiree Nick recht, wenn sie sagt, dass eine Frau frei bestimmen kann, ob sie mit dem Mann Essen gehen will oder nicht. Nur vergisst die alte Dame, dass nicht jeder so viel Selbstbewusstsein geschnuppert hat wie sie.
Wenn man z.b. kein Selbstwertgefühl hat, kann das ganz schön schwierig sein und es kommt zu Gedanken wie ""Vielleicht hab ich es nicht anders verdient"". Es braucht Arbeit und Geduld, um zu verstehen, dass man gar nichts muss, aber dafür muss man auch bewusst und aktiv am Selbstwertgefühl arbeiten."
"ich bin auch in der privilegierten Position, dass ich im Berufsalltag nie in eine solche Situation gekommen bin. Im Privatumfeld hingegen schon. Daher kann ich mir vorstellen wieviel Druck auf einem lastet, vor allem als junge Person, um es dem Chef Recht zu machen. Und ich denke auch nicht, dass es von 0 auf 100 geht und der einen direkt in de Abstellraum zerrt. Ich denke eher, dass ist so über viele Wochen hinweg, erst eine Hand auf dem Rücken, dann mal ein Meeting kurz vor Feierabend und es ist fast niemand mehr im Büro, sodass man sich sicher fühlt. Und dann wird es aufdringlicher und aufdringlicher und ich man überlegt sich ""ist das jetzt schon ein Übergriff?"" Ich kann mich jedenfalls an einen Chef erinnern, bei dem ich als Praktikantin gearbeitet habe, wo ich ein ganz mulmiges Gefühl hatte. Der wollte immer die Tür schließen bei jeder Besprechung, egal wie banal. Der hat mich Aufgaben doppelt und dreifach machen lassen, nur um zu sehen wie ich mich darüber ärgere. Ich bin froh, dass ich da nach einem Monat weg war, aber ich kann mir gut vorstellen, dass so jemand Stück für Stück probiert die Kontrolle zu übernehmen. Ich komme mir dann doof vor, wenn ich als Praktikantin sage ""dir Tür bleibt offen"", dann unterstelle ich ihm ja etwas."
"Was irgendwie nie angesprochen wird wenn es um die Unschuldsvermutung geht: die gilt für das Opfer doch genauso, jemanden fälschlich wegen etwas anzuzeigen, das er nicht gemacht hat, ist genauso eine Straftat."
"Gute, wichtige und interessante Diskussion. Nur Frau Nick halte ich in dieser Runde für komplett überflüssig. Sie hat leider nichts begriffen, senkt das Niveau und es mangelt ihr an Empathie."
"33:11 Absolut wahre Worte - sehr gut, dass er das endlich mal aufklärt: Toxische Männlichkeit vs. ÜBERmännlichkeit. Ich kann den Begriff ""Toxische Männlichkeit"", den jeder heute nur noch nachplappert, weil er ""hip"" klingt, nicht mehr hören. Männlichkeit in ihrer gesunden, ausbalancierten Form ist etwas Wunderbares, genauso wie ""toxische Weiblichkeit"" (Übersexualisierung der eigenen Person oder Gluckenhaftigkeit) etwas UNangenehmes sein kann. Männer benötigen für ein gesundes psychisches Wachstum als Kinder Liebe und Wertschätzung (wie jedes Kind natürlich) - eine starke, emotional verfügbare Vaterfigur, die dennoch liebevoll und warm ist - das wird noch viel Zeit benötigen, bis die Kriegstraumata der vergangenen Generationen geheilt sind und damit die Öffnung des Mannes hin zur Wärme und Herzlichkeit + Offenheit, über Gefühle zu sprechen, gedeihen können."
Silvie war hier so stark!
"@Silvi Carlsson ist einfach nur eine Mood, ihre Blicke und und Mimiken sind einfach nur relatable. Vor allem, wenn man weiss, dass sie mehr Ahnung hat als andere."
Silvi war einfach toll. Danke für deinen Einsatz!
danke Anil für deine starken und wahren Worte
"Desiree Nick ist so unangenehm...dass sie nicht mal anerkennt, wie privilegiert sie ist und wie sie sich dann so frauenverachtend äußert. Unglaublich! Auch die Art ud Weise, wie sie diskutiert.. muss echt nicht sein die Frau!"
"8:19 SILVI, ich FÜHLE es, ich fühle es!!!"
Ralf bönt war definitiv der einzige der wirklich differenziert disskutieren kann über dieses thema
"Tolles Video, sehr wichtiges Thema. Hätte mir nur gerne die Endrésumés von allen 6 Debattenteilnehmern gewünscht. Ich finde vor allem diese besonders spannend und wichtig."
"Im Servis , zum Beispiel in einer Bar,erlebte ich es alltäglich,da kommt noch der Alkohol dazu fallen die Hemmungen.ich habe mir an jedem Ort den Respekt erkämpfen müssen,wir in solchen Berufen müssen denm anderen Geschlecht schon noch die Stirn bieten  Da es so ist dass Männer jagen und die Frau entscheidet wie weit es geht , müssen wir zusammen sexuelle andeutungen gerade laut aussprechen, gerade blosstellen,keine Zeit vergehen lassen...wehrt euch 💃auch Männer sind betroffen ,Frauen haben dieses Machtgetue auch drauf.Auch einmischen wenn es irgendwie gefühlt wird ,,wo fängts an ,,jeder und jede kennt die Grenze,es wird in Sekundenschnelle gefphlt ganz klar ,danke gutes Thema"
"Schweres Thema, ich kann beide Seiten verstehen. Aber wenn ich in einem Betrieb arbeite, wo ich mit den Chefs essen gehen muss um nicht meinen Job zu verlieren, möchte ich (nur persönlich ich!) gar kein Teil des Betriebs mehr sein weil ich sowas nicht vertrete. Ich möchte 100% meinen Betrieb vertreten können und mit gutem Gewissen sagen können „der Betrieb ist sehr gut“. Sonst ist doch gutes Arbeiten nicht möglich."
"Das scheint ein Generationen Konflikt zu sein oder? Spannend wäre mal zu schauen, wie das Bild innerhalb der Generationen aussehen würde 🤔 Wirklich tolle und wichtige Diskussion, ich stimme beiden Positionen in manchen Punkten zu 🤔"
Silvi ich fühle jede deiner Reaktionen
"Ufff, das war echt hart mitanzugucken!"
Poschardt ist wunderbar vernünftig und gelassen. Er argumentiert rhetorisch und inhaltlich sauber. Danke dafür!
"Mit persönlich sind in meinem Berufsleben überwiegend höfliche, aber zumindest respektvolle Männer begegnet"
"Eigentlich eine schöne Diskussion (finde euer Format generell super!) und viele Gäste, deren Einstellung ich trotz unterschiedlicher Meinungen irgendwie nachvollziehen konnte. Aber Désirée Nick war wirklich schwer zu ertragen. Natürlich ist es wichtig verschiedensten Positionen Raum zu bieten, nach ihrem Auftritt hier würde ich jedoch wirklich dafür plädieren dieser Frau hier  und generell in den öffentlichen Medien keinen Raum mehr zu geben. Ihre Schuldzuweisungen den Opfern von sexuellem Missbrauch gegenüber waren absolut menschenverachtend und sind ein Schlag in das Gesicht einer jeden Frau (oder Mann) die solche Erfahrungen machen musste. Sie hat die Diskussion argumentativ nicht bereichert und betreibt eine völlig narzisstisch anmutende Form der Selbstdarstellung- und Inszenierung. Es gibt genug gebildete, aufgeweckte Menschen mit interessanten Erfahrungen und Meinungen in dieser Gesellschaft, da müssen wir dieser Person nun wirklich keine Bühne mehr bieten!"
"Ich fand MeToo super. Bis der Begriff verwässert worden war und jeder schiefe Blick und jedes unglückliche Kompliment (ja, nicht jeder ist ein rhetorischer Vollprofi) gleich als ""MeToo"" hochstilisiert wurde."
"Laengst ueberfaellig diese metoo bewegung. Habe selbst viel erfahrrung mit solchen maennern gemacht. Schlimm ist es,wenn es den job betrifft auf den man gerade angewiesen ist. Frauen brauchen viel mehr Respekt und anerkennung"
"Ralf Bönt hat die Situation von Männern sehr gut erklärt, zu diesem Ergebnis kam im übrigen auch eine Frau namens Vera Birkenbihl."
"Das war die erste Debatte, die mir hier wirklich nicht gefallen hat. Desiree Nick ist für ihre provokante und oft sehr konfrontative Art doch bekannt, das finde ich in einem solchen Format absolut fehl am Platz."
"Silvie, einfach nur ein Engel!"
alter die Frau auf der gelben Seite geht ja mal garnicht
"Frau Nick, natürlich kann ich nein sagen. Aber das Problem ist doch, dass die Frage überhaupt im Raum steht! 
Dass man sich überhaupt Sorgen machen muss, seinen Job zu verlieren wenn man nicht mit dem Chef essen geht, das das Angebot überhaupt gemacht wird, das alleinig ist das Problem."
"Die Beispiele finde ich sehr kritisch, weil es noch keine Rechtsprechung zu den Fällen gibt. Das ist eine Vorverurteilung - bei der ich seit dem Fall Kachelmann sehr, sehr vorsichtig geworden bin.
Wenn es der Frau passiert ist, dann sind die Verurteilungen oft noch sehr niedrig in Deutschland. Würde mir nur wünschen, dass die Medien sich da raus halten und diese Diskussion nicht öffentlich geführt wird, sondern vor Gericht gelöst wird."
"Bestes aktuelles Beispiel ist ja jetzt Snoop Dogg, da ist ja jetzt interessant, ob und wenn wann da irgendwelche Konsequenzen für ihn entstehen werden."
"Für mich gibt es in dieser Debatte immer nur 2 Seiten: Sie ist doch selbst verantwortlich und hätte jederzeit nein sagen können. Oder: Sie hatte keine Chance und Männer müssen jetzt erkennen dass sie was ändern müssen mit Bezug auf toxische Männlichkeit. 

Für mich liegt die Lösung wie immer in der Mitte dazwischen: Es ist unbestritten so, dass ich mir die Situation unfassbar deprimierend und frustrierend vorstelle, durch ein Essen mit dem Chef dass in keiner Weise aus genuiner Motivation entsteht (um hier die ""harmloseste"" der im Video genannten Nötigungen als Beispiel aufzugreifen) meinen Job sichern zu müssen. Das sind Zustände die auf jeden Fall geändert werden müssen. Dennoch muss das Argument gelten können: Wenn ein Job, egal wie lukrativ, welche Aufstiegschancen und welches Prestige er bringt, Dinge mit sich bringt die so starke Übergriffe, die potentiell traumatisch sind, beeinhalten, muss die psychische Selbstfürsorge im Vordergrund stehen. Ein großes Problem in diesem Zusammenhang ist zum einen dass ein Großteil der Frauen schon im frühen Kindesalter dazu konditioniert werden, Probleme mit dem Setzen von klaren Grenzen zu bekommen. Die alten physisch basierten Geschlechterrollen sind in den meisten Familien psychologisch leider noch sehr stark ausgeprägt. Genau so verhält es sich mit dem kalkulierten Grenzüberschreiten und  Sich-durchsetzen bei Männern. Nun sehe ich ein großes Problem in dem Terminus toxische Männlichkeit. Damit wird impliziert dass die Verantwortung für ein Umdenken allein bei Vertretern des männlichen Geschlechts zu suchen ist. Man stelle sich im Umkehrschluss vor man würde die Unfähigkeit zum klaren Setzen von Grenzen als toxische Weiblichkeit bezeichnen. Für mich wäre ein Ansatz dass man schon in der frühkindlichen Konditionierung bei beiden Geschlechtern die heutigen Probleme im Auge hat und denen entgegen wirkt ohne dabei mit dem Finger auf eine Seite zu zeigen und zu sagen: Du wirst mal das Problem sein."
"Desirée Nick: ""Ich würde es nicht privilegiert nennen ich nenne es selbstbewusst"" ahhhh
Ihr Selbstbewusstsein ist ein Privileg. Keine Ahnung wie ihre Kindheit/Vergangenheit war, aber wenn sie ein Umfeld/Personen hatte die sie unterstützten und ihr dadurch geholfen haben überhaupt zu einer so Selbstsicheren Person die Boundaries setzen kann zu werden, dann ist das ein Privileg"
"Man sollte doch manchmal daran denken, dass es etwas völlig anderes ist sich eine Situation vorzustellen oder wirklich in soeiner zu stecken. Mir sind schon viele Dinge passiert in denen ich unbeholfen war/ komisch reagiert habe usw die ich mir so niemals vorstellen könnte. Die meisten würden doch denken, dass sie sich wehren wenn jemand ihnen ein leid antun möchte. Aber realität ist dass das nicht jeder kann. Man ist perplex/ blind vor liebe/ finanziel oder sozial abhängig von jemandem / völlig eingeschüchtert.. da reagiert man nicht mehr wie man das im normalfall vlt gern hätte"
Das ist wahnsinnig jetzt muss man sich von einem älteren Mann sagen lassen ob Frauen belästigst werden oder nicht
Super starkes Video! Dennoch kann man manchmal nur den Kopf schütteln über Aussagen der  gelben Seite.
"Was ich neben Desiree Nick besonders bezeichnend fand, war der Kommentar von wegen ""Hat sich ja schon viel getan, das wird ja überhaupt nicht toleriert."" Aber jede Frau und jedes Mädchen weiß, dass wir viel zu oft im Alltag sexistische Sachen mitbekommen. Wie oft werden Witze über Themen wie Vergewaltigung, SA und allgemeinen Sexismus gemacht, über die auch noch gelacht werden? 
So lange, wie andere Männer daneben stehen und mitlachen oder sich nicht explizit dagegen aussprechen, wird das toleriert!"
"Frau Nick macht es sich da zu einfach und schiebt die Schuld wieder den Frauen zu... nicht jede Frau hat gelernt ihre Grenzen zu ziehen und sich hier so klar zu positionieren... ich musste auch erst lernen selbstbewusst und bestimmt Grenzen zu ziehen und Männer zurecht zu weisen, wenn sie mir zB zu nahe kommen. Gerade junge Mädchen können mit solchen Dingen oft nicht umgehen und lassen dann vielleicht Dinge zu, die sie gar nicht möchten. Aber ich gebe ihr soweit recht, dass jeder Mensch und vor allem jedes Mädchen lernen sollte, diese Grenzen zu ziehen. Ich als Pädagogin kann sagen, dass die Erziehung der Kinder sich zumindest in diesem Punkt in eine positive Rihtung bewegt... Stichwort Selbstbestimmung, offnere Kommunikation über Themen wie Sexualität, Grenzen usw..."
She really sounds like she nose what she's talking about
how many woman get away with false accusations tho?
"Couldnt prove her allegations in court so she says he ""got away with it""

Its innocent until proven guilty. Not guilty the moment a woman says something against you.

They shouldnt allow charges to even be laid without evidence. This is ridiculous."
There was no evidence
"Associated Press, This is amazing! I can't stop smiling!"
Allegations are like currency to them.
No respect for anyone who picks and chooses when to speak out.
Nobody is checking for her…
When did they overturn  it?   I never knew.
"She deserves to be condemned for creating a hate movement that destroyed many innocents lives and careers. No one, ESPECIALLY w0m3n, should ever be believed off their word alone. Innocent until proven guilty."
Everytime i see who is the founder. I just smh..
The people in this comments section need to go behind bars.
What about the false allegations?
Nose👃or knows?
"She looks like she gets harassed allot.



😂😂😂😂😂😂"
"Eeew, not me!!!!"
Maybe their low conversations because most are false
She speaks the truth
expressly when women lie about it and get away with it
"they get away with it much, they don't think it's wrong"
"He is not going to get away,"
🥀
"They only care if the perpetrator is a republican. If he is a democrat, the victim is a liar."
"Sexual harassment can include words like “Lookie Lookie, We Got a Hookie"
"F the me too movement, and Hollyweird!"
"""MeToo"" movement -started by Tarana Burke in 2007.  Men who understand this global issue also are meant to call attention to the damage caused by misogynist behaviour amongst their male peers."
"just because they said they were raped, doesn't mean that it really happened"
"So,I was beaten, held against my will and threatened to be killed if I left from a marriage back in the late 70's of which laws where different back then,would I be able to be a part of the Me movement?and that's a small part of the horrible story!"
These b****** in the me-too movement are nothing more then racist
"Now that some of these women are rich and famous, they feel ashamed of what they did to advance themselvs."
"well im screwed... i kissed many woman, even had sex with a few. got one pregnant after marrying her... wonder what crimes ive committed..."
Tara Reade wants justice!
"Thanks,  Investigations, Training Courses, EEO."
Never again ask of or about honor killings in Islam again....period
"Most people tell my group to be silent.  My group speaks out on the abuse of animals  ... for food.
Also, MEN are told to be silent.  silent about the fact that women are NOT  the only ones abused, and that men are not the only perpetrators."
The white man must tend to his people and not worry of Islam....period
Are these the celebrities that attended the Freak off and knew about the abuse Diddy was dishing out???
2 kids and a dad dead-probably shot in their sleep.Galveston.Happens all the time America.When our we gonna get past this cultural sugar and spice thing.Feminism is 50 years old.We need half of the population to grow up-like in the next 2 hrs!And that is actually too damn slow!
"I was so very shocked that at least 20 of my close friends shared this😵
I thought it wasn't common!"
"nice movement but we have to make it allegation not only a movement so that suspects must be punished and laws should be revised as to create harrassement of any kind in working environment or anywhere by any means voice, inappropriate touching, or whatever or pressurizing women to keep quiet...........should be at all cost sorted out...as we all LOVE OUR WOMEN and to make their lives more comfortable we all have to encourage and support it...."
so basically women remained silence for money
This shouldn't be a gender war thing it's happening to both gender this is a real issue in américa that i had no idea.
Muslim men do not worry of harrassing women .......They to busy learning and studying God and not a loose woman...period
Where is Corey Feldmen and Corey Hiam acknowledgement of what happened to them pedophilia and rape and everyone stayed silent. They should be included in all the awards that are given to actor that have been harassed and raped.
Help me push this Cathy O'Brien a spokeswoman for the me-too movementshe has a lot to say and mainstream media will not air it she has rocks like everyone else but the powers-that-be keep her oppressed
"Soon the birth rate will go down, as men will be scared to approach women (who will increasingly be in gay relationships)."
These women knowingly went along with these sexual favors to pursue their careers. This is the way this industry works. If they were so upset by this why did continue? Why bring it up now?? I don't condone this behavior by these men but this was allowed to continue.
"The me-too movement is ridiculous.  Of course we all condemn rape, but rape is not what the me-too movement is about.  The me-too movement, very much like the safe space, trigger warning politically correct movement, conflates something as serious as rape with every single gesture men make toward women that might have the slightest hint of sexuality.  Not only is that stupid, it smacks of power hunger and the same kind of deranged thinking that has produced the fantasy that there are as many as 135 different genders.  These are crazy people."
very nice to put your problem of friends
why didn't she takes help of parents
#metoo low-key #ustoo because my mom and I are also involved
"So you got ""sexually harassed"" and didn't say anything for a 1 year, 5 years, 15 years or more??? Right....? I'm not saying it's ok to do this to anyone, but it just seems like most are jumping on the bandwagon for the attention or their 15 minutes of fame. In reality it's all their fault for not speaking out sooner and possibly saving a very large number of women the same problems they went through, but instead they put their careers before anyone else."
these comments are absolutely insane what the hell
"thanks ABC

now I have brain cancer"
Funny enough that wanting better roles for women didn't keep these chicks from becoming famous and taking bad roles to get there. You have no one to blame but yourselves.
at he new normal: women will not be hired due to fear of harassment charges. There's going to be a backlash!
"If women are so tough as feminist say, why are they calling every little flirtation as harrassment. poor little helpless flowers."
Wheres the me 2 movement now?? Double standards are bullshit.
STOP HIRING WOMEN GIVE THE MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Me too is a witch hunt
poor melano........shes a little tank now......lol
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉😊
#lol
#me boo hoo
I scha to see you there is also a great for me.
Now media will spoil the career of Emraan Hashmi by showing this repeatedly so that after big directors will not take him in their films.This bulshit media did the same thing with Sushant singh rajput
"La vidéo est excellente et intéressante, je trouve ça juste dommage de ne pas avoir parlé de la fin de l’affaire Sandra Muller notamment avec le fait qu’elle a été reconnue coupable de diffamation envers la personne qu’elle a accusé"
"comment en tant que femme on peut OSER dire ""passez a autre chose, ne soyez pas choquée pour la vie"" mais c'est la honte, honteuse madame"
"Le nombre de commentaires qui essaient de minimiser les faits de viol c'est incroyable... un rapport obtenu sous la contrainte ou la menace est un viol ! Celles qui refusaient ses avancés se faisaient retirer des projets et il incitait les autres à ne pas faire appel à elles ! Quand c'est ton métier c'est un levier de pression énorme, si on vous menaçait de vous retirer vos sources de revenus si vous ne cédez pas je pense que la situation ne serait pas aussi binaire que ça."
"Un sujet sensible, abordé avec finesse et sobriété, franchement bravo à toi Gaspard, toujours un plaisir de visionner tes vidéos et hâte de voir ce que tu nous prépare pour 2023 !"
"L'autre qui dit que c'est aux femmes d'etre forte quand il y a un frotteur ca me rend folle. Le mec qui fait ca on devrait lui couper les couilles mais non c'est a la femme de dire ""excusez moi, vous vous branlez contre ma cuisse, je ne suis pas choquée mais faite votre vie ailleurs"""
"Très bonne vidéo!! Et merci d'avoir parlé de la fondatrice du mouvement me too, Tarana Burke, une militante afro-americaine qui est souvent invisibilisée parce que tout le monde pense que ce sont des femmes blanches qui ont créé ce hashtag, alors qu'il existait déjà depuis des années avant 2017 dans la communauté noire. J'ai cru à tord que tu n'en parlerais pas et j'ai été agréablement surprise, preuve que tu as bien fait tes recherches !"
"Une superbe video comme d'habitude ! Les histoire de  sont toujours aussi intéressant.
Vu que nous sommes en 2023 , ce sera les 10 ans de la mort de Nelson mandela
Je pense qu'un histoire de nelson mandela ou sur l'appartheid en afrique du sud serai super intéressant !"
Un sujet clivant que tu abordes avec qualité et avec une aisance à l'oral qui nous permet de rester captivés. Tes vidéos immersives méritent d'être davantage regardées.
"Etonnant de la part de ce Westein, avec son sourire, sa beauté si touchante et son elocution toute en délicatesse, tout en lui dégageait l'elégance ! 😅"
"Merci beaucoup d’avoir abordé ce sujet avec autant de clarté et d’intelligence ! 
Comme je l’ai déjà vu dans les commentaires, je conseille également le film She Said qui retrace l’enquête de Jodie et sa collègue au NY Times. Cela m’a person permis de bien mieux comprendre l’émergence de ce mouvement !"
"Ces quelques notes au piano en musique de fond, c'est la musique de The Social Network. Je le dis parce que j'arrivais pas à retrouver d'où je l'avais entendue, donc si certains cherchent... si ça peut aider"
Great video mate. A funny anecdote : in english media Farrow was given much more spotlight and had to remind people on a few occasions in his interviews that he was not the first person to uncover the story.
Bravo! Une super vidéo comme d'habitude avec un travail impressionnant de recherche et d'écriture. Merci à toi et toute ton équipe pour tout le contenu que vous proposez
"Je sais pas si tu as vue le film ""She Said"", sortit en 2022, adapté du livre. C'est un super film qui brise le cœur en entendant tout ses témoignage de femme terroriser par cette homme."
Cette video etait vraiment immerssive rien a dire sur la calité du montage et la narration etait juste incroyable j atteds la prochaine video avec grande impatience!
"Je viens de visionner le film ""she Said"" sur le sujet . Ta vidéo est parfaite pour illustrer le sujet et l'approfondir.Bravo"
« C’est pas votre faute mais vous vous traumatisez pas pour le reste de votre vite » faut y aller pour sortir ça
"Infiniment Merci Gaspar G
J'apprécie votre talent 
En lisant ensuite les commentaires 
Pour les précisions partagées 
Et donc Merci aussi à toutes & tous 

Avec Bienveillance & Gratitude 
Cordialement 
🤲🙏♾🙏🤲"
"Une vidéo passionnante, merci à toute l’équipe pour ce travail si qualitatif !!"
"Pour les curieux qui veulent en savoir encore plus sur l'affaire Weistein, il y a un film, très intéressant, qui s'appelle ""She said"" qui retrace toute l'histoire."
"Salut Gaspard, ton contenu est hyper qualitatif, je sais que ça prend du temps mais ça serai possible de faire plus régulièrement des « Histoires de » ?"
"Toujours un plaisir de t’écouter (malgré le sujet….). 
Tu as une façon intelligente précise et concise de raconter !
Hâte de voir les prochaines vidéos !"
j'aime bien parce que la femme dit que c'est aux femmes d'être forte et de dire aux hommes de ne pas se frotter mais c'est à eux de ne pas se comporter de manière si dégueulasse dans un lieux publique.
"C'est super de regarder tes Vidéos Gaspard, trés intéressant ... merci à toi"
"Bravo à toute l'équipe pour cette vidéo 👍
J'étais pas en France pendant cette période et j'ai l'impression d'avoir récupéré 5 ans d'infos en 10mn, et bravo aux femmes qui ont eu le courage de témoigner"
"Incroyable qualité et un travail de dingue,  super vidéo merci !!! Bon courage pour la suite"
"Vidéo intéressante et basée sur l'impartialité,
merci pour ça. Je voulais ajouter qu'en France la
diffamation est rarement retenue lorsque la personne
est prise 'en grip' par les associations, comme le montage
fallacieux de France Télévision concernant l'affaire Depardieu ,
par exemple ."
"Un sujet sensible, abordé avec finesse et sobriété, franchement bravo à toi Gaspard, toujours un plaisir de visionner tes vidéos et hâte de voir ce que tu nous prépare pour 2023 !"
"Travail de qualité ça fait plaisir, le simple placement de la pub pile au bon moment et pas au milieu d’une phrase en est exemple (oui oui c’est rare)."
La vérité commence à arriver tout doucement ❤
"Rappelons, à toutes fins utiles, qu’aucun de ces viols n’a impliqué de pénétration, et que 100% des actrices qui ont refusé ses avances n’ont pas été violées. Ce qui n’enlève rien au reste, notamment les tentatives d’abus de pouvoir systématiques et permanentes, mais le portrait du prédateur sexuel en question est plutôt atypique - ce qui n’est jamais vraiment clairement exposé."
"Excellente vidéo, c’est génial que tu parles de ce genre de sujets qui a besoin de visibilité 👌"
"Incroyable vidéo, je me souviens du mouvement et en quoi il consistait plus ou moins mais très instructif, c'est bien de savoir exactement ce qu'il en ressort dans une vidéo aussi bien réalisée"
"Trop bien ces vidéos, heureuse d’être abonnée ! Le meilleur pour la suite !"
"Merci pour le boulot ! Ça résume l’affaire et tes deux parties sont hyper équilibrées, c’est un plaisir à regarder comme d’hab 🫡
Par contre 7% de viewers abonnés, sachant que t’as à peu près 300.000 vues par vidéo, ça veut dire que sur tes presque 500k abonnés il n’y a que 25k qui regardent la vidéo ? Y’a un gros problème de référencement nn?"
"18:36 ''les femmes, vous êtes traumatisées d'avoir été agressées S. Bah arrêtez'' Ok merci Catherine 🥴"
"Incroyable vidéo, encore !! Très bien écrit, très bien structuré, très bien monté... Bref, du grand art, BRAVO !!!
Je trouve ça bien que tu mettes les noms de toutes les personnes qui t'ont aidé sur la vidéo !"
"Trop bien la découverte de la chaîne, et trop bien les vidéos c’est très interessant et tu racontes bien ✨
Belle voix btw hihi"
Tu pourrais faire une vidéo sur l’explication de la guerre d’Algerie sinon continue comme ça !!
"toujours aussi pertinent et minutieux, merci pour tes vidéos !!!!"
"Super vidéo, merci de parler de sujets comme ça c'est hyper important. Cependant je me dois de faire une petite remarque, le fait d'utiliser les termes ""des comportements inappropriés envers les femmes"" pour désigner les agressions sexuelles et les viols n'est pas acceptable pour ma part. Ces comportements ne sont pas seulement ""pas appropriés"" ils sont horrifiants, ils sont interdits, ce sont des crimes. Et l'utilisation du terme ""inapproprié"" dans ce contexte est une énorme minimisation qui je trouve n'est pas négligeable. Sinon, continue tes vidéos, elles sont très passionnantes !"
Merci pour ton travail de synthèse
"Gaspard, t'as pas idée à quel point j'ai attendu une nouvelle vidéo de t'as part, t'as trop tarder, mais merci pour ce que tu proposes"
"Ton travail est d’une extrême justesse, merci de parler aussi bien de sujets aussi importants 🙏"
Je te découvre avec cette vidéo. J’ai hâte de voir le reste du taff fait sur cette chaîne !!
"hey ben, j'adore le format ! Super travail ! Je suis retournée par l'histoire ..."
"Il y a le film ""She Said"" sortit il y a pas longtemps qui retrace aussi cette histoire sur certaines personnes veulent en voir un peu plus ! (Même si dans mes souvenirs toutes les informations que tu dis dans ta vidéo sont aussi dans le film)"
Rien de mieux qu'une notification de Gaspard G. Très belle vidéo comme d'habitude
Coïncidence énorme ! Je suis actuellement en train de lire l’autobiographie de Rose McGowan 😮
"Vraiment intéressant, Gaspard, j’ai apprit des choses, merci."
Merci pour ton travail toujours aussi qualitatif !
Je suis tout a fait d'accord avec avec le mouvement me too je suis collégiens j'ai été victime d'attouchements et de commentaires sexiste c'est difficile pour moi...de temps en temps je me remets en question est ce que c'est moi qui a cherché ça.. mais avec l'aide de mes parents je vais mieux et je continue ma vie normale
"Super intéressant 👌 Puis la dynamique de fin, poualala.
En theme yen a tellement mais perso sur histoire de different pays ça serait super intéressant : Genre l'histoire de la France (en plusieurs ep), le Japon, l'Amérique, l'égypte,...
Et sinon en personnage un episode sur louis de Funès, Hitler, La reine Elizabeth, tellement de possibilitées🤩
Continue commence, jkiff tes vidéos"
"Clair, propre, concis ... un très bon travail ... bravo jeune homme je te souhaite une longue vie médiatique... on ne s'ennui pas une seconde"
Il y a également le film She Saïd sorti il y a quelques années. Très bien fait et très éclairant sur l'affaire
"Salut Gaspard, j'adore ce format j'ai tout regardé, je me disais qu'un épisode ""Histoire de"" sur la vie de Joseph Kessel, un homme au mille vies, ça serait super intéressant :)"
super interessant comme d’habitude!
"Dans le cas de Sandra Muller il aurait peut-être été judicieux d'expliquer l'affaire judiciaire (encore en cours, il me semble)"
"Franchement, j'aurais jamais pensé à lui ... Superbe vidéo ! Et prochain sujet Strauss Khan !!  (DSK)"
"Claire et bien sur documenté comme d'habitude 👍. Et même quand on a pu suivre l'affaire, tu nous apprends toujours certains côtés que nous pouvons ne pas connaître.
Merci, merci pour toutes les femmes"
"Super vidéo, vraiment. C'est tellement intéressant, clair et bien raconté merciii ! ❣❣"
Une nation ne peut évoluer sans prendre en considération la moitié de son humanité.
"Oui ! 

Encore une vidéo de notre célèbre Gaspard G 
Tu es génial, continue tes vidéos !"
trop bien la vidéo ça fait plaisir de te revoir!
Je me baladais sur ta chaine en espérant regarder une video que je n'avais pas encore vu et hélas j'avais déjà fait le tour mais miracle !  tu viens de refaire ma soirée en sortant cette video ! merci à toi et bravo pour ton travail et ton equipe qui se cache dans l'ombre !
Merci c'est toujours un plaisir!! Et très enrichissant. Merci beaucoup 🙏😊
"Vidéo très intéressante, bien expliquée et dynamique malgré tout ! Merci à toute l’équipe ! +1 abo"
A quand l'histoire sur Valery Giscard d'Estaing ? Pour le fun ? Ou alors George Pompidou ? Ou alors Raymond Poincaré ?
Bonjours Gaspard tu devrais une réel sur le meet Too homme qui est apparut sur X
Gaspard je te remercie j’avais besoin pour un exposé de détail sur cette affaire tu viens de me sauver
"13:01 ""ça marche super bien, car il est resté super longtemps""😂😂😂"
"Je ne connaissais pas les origines, merci  c'est bien expliqué"
Enfin la vidéo que tt le monde attendait 😀
"Pourrais tu faire « l’histoire de Pablo escobar » ça serait super cool.
Ps : super vidéo continue"
Super vidéo moi je t'ai pas vraiment au courant de cette histoire je connaissais de bon mais bon ça sert à ça ta chaîne et c'est super merci encore pour cette histoire
Ils savaient tous...
"C'est vrai que Catherine Millet est totalement une habituée du métro et aux frotteurs ""du métro"" ... 😂"
j’espère du plus haut de mon cœur que tes videos soient montrees dans les ecoles
"Du montage au contenu, ta vidéo est vraiment bonne. Bon travail Gasp !"
Y a le film qui vient d arriver en streamiing
Merci por le contenu de tes videos. Je apprendre et pratiqué mon français avec leurs
Super vidéo ! Merci beaucoup à vous et à toute l’équipe pour ce travail de qualité !
"Vive la bien pensance ♥️
J'ai la larme à l'œil 😢"
😊 jaime.
"Merci pour la qualité de cette vidéo, comme toujours!! Est ce que tu pourrais parler des Panama Papers ? J'ai toujours eu du mal à comprendre cette histoire..."
"Grand sujet, voir meme délicat. Je trouve très bien abordé et bien écrit. 
Bravo à toute l'équipe."
"J’adore la simplicité et l’ambiance des histoires. J’ai pensé à un sujet, je sais pas si ça a déjà été fait ou si c’est un sujet intéressant mais je pose ça la. A propos du crash d’avion du gouvernement polonais en 2010. Bonne continuation"
"salut gaspard, ne fait pas attention aux vues qui sont très nettement moins élevées que ton contenu ""histoire de..."". Ce sont des contenus importants et crois moi, tu éduques indirectement les jeunes. Merci pour cette vidéo qui a du être très délicate à écrire mais qui est au final réussi! bonne continuation"
Ma nouvelle chaîne YouTube préférée ❤❤❤❤
"Salut, je t’es découvert hier et depuis je regarde toute tes vidéos ! Qualités incroyables, j’espère que tu iras très loin ! 

Ps: Un jour l’histoire d’Eminem ( j’aimerai bien l’entendre venant de toi ) 

Force à toi !"
"""Et ça commence à devenir emmerdant"" 😂😂😂"
Contente de te découvrir
Tu pourrais faire l’histoire de Angela Merkel merci sinon continue comme ça t’es au top
"Superbe vidéo comme d’habitude, j’adore ce que tu propose comme contenue 👍"
"Merci pour ton travail! Vraiment interessante et me semble très complète…
J’espère vraiment que ça va réduire jusqu’à cesser… ce sont vraiment d’horribles faits par des personnes tellement aléatoires…"
Bravo aux femmes journalistes qui ont réussi à mettre fin au agissements de ce grand pervers sexcuel elles ont rendu justice à toutes les victimes Merci Gaspard pour ton sérieux de traiter ces affaires si difficile
"Discours fluide, des faits chronologiques,  des sources croisées GaspardG a bien creusé son enquête"
merci pour cette très bonne et complète vidéo !! c’est bien de ne pas laisser ces affaires tomber dans l’oubli
Passionnant… bravo. Continue comme ça! J’aime ton traitement de l’info.
Les gars abonnés vous il fait vraiment du bon travail et il raconte trop bien
"Ce que j'ai retenu le plus, c'est l'augmentation des femmes battues durant la pandémie de covid. Je déteste ces lâches. Ça me rappelle la dernière violence de mon père sur ma mère. Puis grâce à notre voisine ( une mamie), tout c'est arrêté. Elle est intervenue. Il a eu un déclic. Nous ne l'oublierons jamais ainsi que tout le quartier🥰."
il faudrait qu'on évoque un jour les violences faites aussi aux hommes par des hommes ou par des femmes dans le privé et dans l'entreprise ! Mais çà reste tabou
"Ce documentaire questionne le droit des femmes. Il ne s’agit pas de mettre en conflit les femmes contre les hommes. Si vous comprenez ce docu de la sorte c’est que vous n’avez pas comprit le but du travail de ces femmes qui luttent contre les formes institutionnalisées d’inégalité des sexes. Il ne s’agit pas de diaboliser les hommes, il s’agit de dialoguer sur le rôle de l’état. Lorsque l’Etat ou le gouvernement impose aux femmes des formes de soumission (IVG illégal, impossibilité de s’éduquer, impossibilité de divorcer etc…) c’est qu’il y a quand même un problème. La normalisation de la violence conjugale et familiale ne concerne pas non plus que les hommes dans le rôle de bourreau (89% d’hommes pendant le covid, une majorité certes mais le reste ce sont des femmes maltraitantes), et dans le rôle des victimes il n’y a pas que des femmes, il y a aussi des enfants dont des petits garçons qui pourraient à leur tour reproduir le schéma en devenant maltraités ou maltraitants."
"Quand je vois à quel point la présomption d'innocence a été foulée aux pieds, je me dis que prendre un peu de recul n'est pas plus mal. 
Et puis, un peu marre de ce discours consistant à faire passer la moitié de l'humanité pour des pauvres petites choses fragiles. La femme est l'égale de l'homme ; la première n'est pas une proie et le deuxième un prédateur."
Ça commence par une systématiquement grossière du patriarcat.
Fantastique vidéo! Merci BEAUCOUP à ces femmes qui font avancer l’égalité femmes-hommes.
"Première phrase du magazine, premier mensonge.
J'ai du mal à croire que ces 3 jeunes femmes soient directrices d'observatoires ou de quelconques instituts faisant un travail sérieux.
Dès le début on nous les présentes puis il s'agit d'exprimer leurs impressions sur une photographie sur laquelle un homme s'apprête à frapper sa compagne .

La première d'entre elles s'interroge sur le signalement à la police de cette violence, la réaction des policiers, l'aide apportée par l'état et la société, et sur la CAPACITÉ FINANCIÈRE de la jeune femme à METTRE UN TERME A LA RELATION !!! Ce sont ses mots...
Non non, on ne rêve pas, à 3'50"" il est déjà question de laisser ses valeurs et sa sécurité de coté pour une question d'argent... Ca sent mauvais pour la suite de la vidéo.

La deuxieme ( la française en plus 🤦‍♂️), dès sa première phrase dis  "" Cette photo illustre LA réalité à laquelle la MAJORITE des femmes sont confrontées""..."" On sait que 1/3 des femmes sera confrontée à un episode de violence dans sa vie"". Voilà, ça résume le brouillard victimaire qu'on nous envoit en pleine figure.. 1/3 est maintenant devenu une majorité, et une réalité horrible et omniprésente se substitue à un instant difficile de sa vie.
Elle souhaite que l'état fasse en prévention des violences sexistes et sexuelles de la "" politique volontariste à tous les niveaux"", ainsi qu'à l'école... !

La troisime finit de m'achever à 4""55 en prononçant devant cette photo la phrase suivante d'emblée : "" Je ne sais pas comment sortir de cette situation, et même sortie je ne sais pas comment rester en vie"".. "" Comment fait'on une fois sortie pour vivre dans une société où on sait qu'on est pas soutenue par l'ETAT"", "" ça pose des questions sur le droit des femmes, la citoyenneté, la manière dont on vit ensemble..."" 

Résumons.. Dans les 5 premières minutes d'introduction du sujet, nous sommes invités à considérer la femme ( la majorité apparemment...) comme un être profondément fragile, dominée par l'homme qu'elle se choisit pour partenaire, et qui au lieut de penser à se lever et à faire ses valises, attend que l'état lui vienne en aide et la protége.
Pire, au lieu d'imaginer une prevention qui aide les femmes à être fortes, à se respecter, à reconnaître les signes de domination et à les fuir, ou à combattre le sexisme, hé bah non 🤷‍♂️ Il faut encore et toujours se poser en victime et maintenant prévenir les jeunes filles ( de leurs futures mauvais choix et faiblesses ? Nooon) que leur copains de recré deviendront de méchants garçons...🤦‍♂️

On est dans une caricature du féminisme qui fait tout sauf du bien aux femmes."
"le reportage part sans doute d'une volonté de bien faire, mais à 20 mins la théorie du genre ....pointe discrètement son nez, c'est furtif mais quand même, je ne savais pas que la vision genrée du monde : mâle-femelle était ""traditionnelle"" ? La biologie est traditionnelle, voir archaïque ??"
soyons seul c'est super....méchants hommes......
"Une approche féministe, comme d'hab. 
Jusqu'au jour où on ne sortira pas de cette logique, pour aller vers une approche vraiment neutre et anti-sexiste (ce qui le féminisme n'est pas), nous il y aura forcément des déséquilibres dans les rapports de genre."
"Dans qq années, le retour du balancier va être terrible (c'est ainsi qu' a tjrs fonctionné la marche du temps ) et ts les ""progressistes"" d'aujourd'hui vont avoir du plomb dans l'aile..."
"Résistez les femmes, on est avec vous! <3"
"La vie de la bourgeoisie semble vraiment difficile, les grandes écoles et les hauts postes sont des fardeaux 🙂"
"Ce qui n'est pas évoqué ici, c'est la menace que fait peser le transgenrisme sur le féminisme. Comme par hasard, c'est un non sujet..."
"Heureusement que les hommes ne se plaignent pas, on en finirait plus avec les hashtag"
"Je ne suis pas sure que la constitution européenne est quelque chose à voir avec le féminisme ni d'ailleurs la protection de la femme, d'ailleurs en quoi serait t'elle concernée puisqu'elle n'a pas de valeur ni de poids de quelque manière que ce soit tant au niveau civil que dans la justice, la Pologne a interdit l'avortement, elle est pourtant bien européenne ?? non ?? la violence n'est ni réprimée ni condamnée et pourtant, elle existe, arrêtons de la nier... 
Quant on voit qu'aux états unis Trump a été élu alors qu'il débitait des ignominies sur les femmes, c'est ça le modèle de société demain ?? quand est-ce que la justice fera son boulot que ce soit ici ou ailleurs pour condamner les violences qui sont inexcusables et inadmissibles
Enfin notre ministre de la justice vient de faire acquitter son fils accusé de violence conjugale, il y a quand même des questions à se poser"
"Quand on fera le proces du covid/confinement, faudra pas qu'on oublié ces victimes aussi"
J'ai la haine de ces lâches qui frappent leurs femmes et pires devant les enfants. C'est très traumatisant et on se sent minable de ne pas pouvoir sauver sa maman 💙.
4:09 Quoi???? Ok donc 1 femme sur 3 devient la majorité.... bravo
Merci pour cette vidéo !
Bravo Nika ❤
"Le féminisme c'est ni plus ni moins que l'équivalent du machisme. Il faut arrêter de tenter de faire passer les féministes pour des personnes plus recommandables que l'abruti qui va traiter les femmes comme des moins que rien. Ces deux types de personnes se moquent bien de vivre en harmonie et ne veulent que l'avantage pour leur sexe sur l'autre sexe. Et si les féministes arrivent pour l'instant à paraître fréquentables, c'est parce que la situation est en faveur des hommes. Et qu'elles jouent sur l'indignation pour empêcher les gens de réfléchir sur le fond de l'idéologie des féministes. Et sur le fait qu'elle implique le passage à un matriarcat et non à une situation d'égalité.

En plus d'un côté comme de l'autre, ils refusent d'admettre que la sexualité et sa mise sous couvert, ainsi que le fonctionnement des êtres humains est la raison des conflits qui existent entre les deux sexes.

Pour comprendre le problème,  il faut se poser des questions sur comment les choses se passent avec les animaux. Et quelles sont les solutions mises en place par ces derniers pour résoudre le problème des relations entre les individus de sexe femelle et ceux de sexe mâle.

Sans oublier que l'on ne relie pas le comportement des individus à leur environnement et à leur état émotionnel, sans oublier l'égoïsme naturel des individus qui n'a pas de sexe."
"Quand on y réfléchit bien,  la problématique se pose de cette façon : que choisir entre une société patriarcale (avec risques de violences envers les femmes) et société matriarcale (avec risque de destruction de la famille) ? Laquelle de ces deux orientations impacte le plus notre société ?"
"Égalité, parité, stop à la violence contre les femmes et  aux féminicides, pas de problèmes en ce qui me concerne ! Mais non aux amazones les machos au féminin. FTW 🏴"
Arte et le féminisme ça devient à gerber
"Toujours cette opposition malsaine entre l'homme privilégié, au dessus de tout et de surcroît bourreau ; versus la femme victime, privée et qui ne dispose d'aucun droit, réclamant le protectionnisme de l'Etat alors que le fémininisme prétend vouloir émanciper les femmes.
Il faudra m'expliquer comment on s'émancipe lorsque l'on réclame l'aide de l'état ?? Il y a un non sens de ce côté là. Cela montre bien que l'argent femme ne survit pas seule ou sans l'aide de qui que ce soit ou d'une institution.
De plus, le fémininisme parle toujours de droits mais jamais de devoirs. Le même féminisme ne se préoccupe jamais des enfants et encore moins des hommes même si pour faire passer son idéologie nauséeuse, le fémininisme prétend se battre pour l'égalité pour tous. Dans le meilleur des cas, sont évoquées les minorités. Mais qui sont les minorités ? Certainement pas les nains, culs de jatte, les trisomiques ?
J'ajouterai que ce même féminisme crache sur son héritage, puisque c'est cette société diabolique qui a apporté le confort dont la plupart peut jouir aujourd'hui et notamment les femmes. C'est toujours facile d'arriver ""après la bataille""... J'aimerais voir ces mêmes femmes dans la violence de conflits armées, je ne suis pas certain que leur idéologie tiendrait bien la route en cas de guerres.
Bref, c'est toujours la même soupe servie et réchauffée qui à force de traîner dans le frigo commence par devenir indigeste. Aucune remise en question non plus du comportement toxique que peuvent avoir les femmes et militantes féministes ...
Le sempiternel 15% d'écart de salaire sorti de nulle part alors qu'il a été démontré que ce chiffre est le résultat du salaire de tous les hommes en comparaison des salaires de toutes les femmes ... Il suffit de consultater le site de l'INSEE pour trouver des statistiques plus proches de la réalité. Cela n'a aucun sens... Le pompom aurait été de dire que les femmes travaillent gratuitement à partir de X date dans l'année ... Affligeant et honteux ...
Et j'apprends que les féministes ont tellement de temps à perdre qu'elles se mettent à compter le nombre d'interactions entre femmes dans un film et si leur conversation ne tourne pas autour d'un homme ... Pathétique.
Femmes, nous vous aimons, et je pense que beaucoup d'hommes dans l'histoire de l'humanité ont fait des odes à l'amour ... Et je dénote trop peu d'écrivaines qui ont romancé l'amour comme l'ont fait les hommes... Seulement maintenant ce fémininisme commence à lasser beaucoup de personnes car il tend vers beaucoup trop absurdité, de haine, de jeux de pouvoir, hommes comme femmes commencent à comprendre qu'il ne s'agit plus d'égalité, mais de renverser la vapeur pour prendre le contrôle. Ouvrez les yeux, tous."
"Ou là, j'ai entendu patriarcat. Ça doit être du sérieux.
Puis j'ai entendu test de bechdel, le nutriscore du cinéma engagé.
Puis masculiniste, forcément toxique. Alors que féministe forcément pas.
Perso je suis pour une patriarcat masculiniste bienveillant. 
Pour l'ecopatriarcat. Mais c'est difficile à faire entendre à des gens comme ça qu'on mène le même combat mais de façon différente.
C'est un combat sérieux, on ne peux pas le laisser aux seuls féministes."
Et maintenant ? y a plus rien !
"et les racines du mal? les religions, par exemples...hum? pas un mot? what!!"
"Je suis victime d’inégalités au sein de mon couple!!!


Je suis un mâle alpha plutôt à l’extrême droite, viriliste, amateur d’arme, de muscu et de bagnole ( oui un beauf facho quoi )…qui cuisine, fait le ménage,l’ administratif, j’adore faire les courses, je m’occupe du jardin, de la rénovation de la maison, des voitures…tout en donnant de l’attention à mon épouse et mes 3 enfants.

Bref l’exemple même d’une société patriarcale…arrêtez de fréquenter des abrutis, de promouvoir le touche pas à mon pote, l’universalisme et la rencontre des luttes diverses et variées.
Quand je vois des femmes féministes, ou lgbt qui ce disent pro-immigration….les cultures qui arrivent avec votre bénédiction vont vous faire mal et pas uniquement à cause de la largeur du tibia de Girafe présent ds le caleçon."
Empoisonnement dans les ecole 😡😡😡????
Si vous voulez que ça change il va falloir critiquer et surtout combattre les religions tout en mettant en place une justice extrêmement punitive.
"Ouf, je viens de me taper les commentaires et mesdames,  je suis 100% avec vous!   Pathétique de voir mes ""camarades"" H se sentir menacés par ces propos...   Français?  😉 C'est bien le pays des coqs!  😆"
"Comment trois personnes issues issues de la bourgeoisie et d'un milieu aisé, représentant des clichés pro occidentaux qui ne sont que le résultat d'un passé révolu et qui n'a plus lieu d'être peuvent représenter des pays culturellement très différent, avec des communautés diverses etc. peuvent se rejoindre avec un langage commun... ?!?!
C'est vraiment du foutage de gueule et du délire !?!? 

Et Alien... C'est le symbole du viol et du phallus...! Est ce que ce que vous pensez est mieux ou plus juste que l'avis de l'auteur, les acteurs etc ?!? ..."
"c'est très bien metoo ça obligera les femmes a faire le premier pas de la séduction 😝
les dragueurs relous finiront en prison"
Après meetoo ... Le retour de baton😂😂😂😂 c est beau ..
"Il faudrait aller plus loin dans la guerre des sexes, c'est trop mou !"
Quand on n'envoie pas de coups de bâton on n'a pas à craindre le retour de celui-ci
❤❤❤
"16:40 Ca me fait toujours rire les militants qui se plaignent que les militants opposés à eux diffusent leur idéologie en s'organisant

Les féministes ne font elles pas des campagnes de diffamation ciblées sur les réseaux? En étant organisées..?"
"A 22mins30 : les problèmes écologiques ?! Le reportage passe par : les violences conjugales pdt les covid, à la situation Iranienne qui est générale et dont toute la population souffre, au droit à l'avortement (?!), aux droits des minorités,  aux droits à la liberté sexuelle (?!) sous entendu de la liberté individuelle sans entrave MAIS SURTOUT  sans être responsable de ces actes : Du coup il faudrait qu'on explique aux féministes comment on tombe enceinte car en 2023 ce n'est toujours pas clair pour elles..... et Nous voilà par une pirouette dans l'écologie et les pénuries d'eau en Iran .....ok..."
"Mettre sur la même plan l'interdiction de l'avortement qui une excellente chose car c'est un meurtre odieux contre l'islamisme des talibans c'est hyper déplacé...

Bref ce reportage est un ramassis de mensonges et faux problèmes"
Par contre la plupart continue des école ministère continue de manger de viande... et perpétré l'exploitation animale notamment les femelles animales c'est choquant .
"Ne vous faites pas niqu... par arte ""de grâce""."

"enjoy your cats women, we aren't EVER gonna approach you EVER again. No single bars, no tinder, no office parties, no supermarkets, no, no, no. We are out."
"In reference to what she says at 0:50. No, it's not easy to pick apart lies because you're not allowed to question these people's stories. Also having a society that wants to believe isn't helping things."
#No proof no justice  ... see anyone can make a hashtag
MGTOW. Leave women alone and keep yourself safe.
"Although men are the root of this problem, if you don't include them in the conversation and discuss the differences between what Franken did, vs Wienstien, vs Trump. and the difference between inappropriate and illegal, you're not going to make any real progress."
So no Guys in on the discussion then.
I heard fear and panic in the black lady's voice. She is a liar
"i took the red pill...employers will simply shut the door and not hire any woman due to the risk of a  sexual harassment charge, you might say they will sue you for discrimination charge, but they will simply pay that small fine, which will save their company, the bosses job, life etc... i am making popcorn and going to watch this ride. buy more cats, i sell cat litter."
MGTOW for life
Yes this will be used for revenge eventually it's a matter of time
What do you mean botching it? The attention is completely off child actors now. It's working perfectly.
"Economics beats politics every time.

I see that men won't have a hard time getting a job I  2018."
"Every single sexual misconduct accusation needs to be investigated. The problem I see is, ""hit and run"" journalism. Let's make the initial report, follow the ""me, toos"", but let it all drop for the next flavor of the week and the conclusion of the incident goes from front page to a byline on page 12. People need to know that there are consequences for their actions. In Franken's case, unlike Moore, there is no one jumping on the situation because of the rampant sexual impropriety that happens in Washington daily. Just do a little research. Just the publicized incidents in this century number around 80."
"The problem with the ""hashtag metoo"" movement is that it ignores a basic reality: there's always at least two sides to every story, and we're basically only hearing one side of each story.

If msnbc wants to stop being largely a target of cynical laughter, perhaps it could start covering both sides of each story. That was what was once called journalism."
"It is time that companies are held responsible and are being fined if they let men be alone with women, or let men ride elevators and such alone with women. If a man is left alone with a woman, the woman should be able to sue for endangerment - no matter who the man is.

There need to be large signs in every elevator and hallway warning men from being alone with women."
"Differences:  Adult/child; consent/non-consent; power disparity; threat (actual, implied, assumed); severity; frequency; timing ➡️ Apology/forgiveness; restitution; lose power/role; (real) rehabilitation; imprisonment? 

- Should we imprison this person?  “Beyond a reasonable doubt” (judge/jury)
- Should s/he pay restitution for causing damage?  “Preponderance of the evidence” or “Which side has better evidence?” (judge/jury)
- Should this person be our babysitter, teacher, pastor, senator, etc.....(People use all available info and their best judgement to select best candidate for the position and responsibility. NO judge or jury.)"
"When you accuse someone of something serious, you should have your ducks in a row so that you can actually bring the wrongdoer to justice (and not just to get attention, which some people will do). Anything can go too far and be used for ill. I think denying that is either irrational, or disingenuous.

I think it's important that this is done correctly, otherwise it won't accomplish what it should.....and the unintended consequences will be catastrophic. Great Video."
Who do we know women won't be accused of sexual harassment
The Aziz Anzari story is a nail in the coffin for the poor me movement.
This movement was botched from the beginning.
"This will not be forgotten for decades. Decades. The Salem Witch Trials were caused by a few little girls telling tall tales; this movement was a concerted effort by thousands of adult, educated, liberated women. I look forward to watching women slowly realize what they've done."
Ms Charles nailed this issue.  You CAN’T be “strategic” about how and when to tell your story.  You MAY get lost in the “white noise” but THAT should NOT be the point?  The Me Too movement is offering HOPE to abused women AND men.  We can only hope and pray that America “listens” and ACTS accordingly
"This is GOOD PEOPLE vs BAD PEOPLE, not boys vs girls. Remember. Now comment."
"I will be doing my part. Quitting my job next week. Working nights in a shop with a woman. Nope, find someone else."
"Name and Shame. If a congressman, pays out, it should be transparent and accountable. No non-disclosure-agreements for people found guilty or harassment!"
You would think that every other man is a sexual harasser. It's like the red scare of the fifties.
"wait i thought we weren't supposed to investigate the allegations and just ""believe women""? so how do we tell if an allegation is fake or true? do we investigate or not?"
No -one questions them. Doubting accusations is a crime in itself. Keep away from women.
3rd wave feminism and the pound metoo movement has caused many men to go MGTOW.
So women are suddenly going to stop trying to attract the rich guys? Women are going to be excluded from everything they do that's inappropriate?
Questioning? What questioning? What interrogation? I see allegations and then a guy loses his job. Listen & believe is the mantra. The accuser should be questioned & interrogated....but currently that is not the case.
"Most people don't do it for good reason. It's not worth it, i.e., let the guilty throw the first stone."
"Im so glad that women, who are so emotionally driven that they will go too far...This will backfire to set back women 100 years UNLESS they own their own businesses."
These women are delusional. #Metoo HAS overreached with Ansari. Men will no longer interact.
"What are women going to do when men have had enough and put them back in the kitchen? They are not equal and the only reason women are in the workforce is because men allowed them to be. Basically it was so you could have 2 incomes in the family. However, if more men are going to stay away from women, there is no reason to keep them in the workforce. There is nothing a woman can do that men can't, but a ton of jobs that only men can do or do better. Don't believe me, go outside and look around. Your home, roads & bridges, buildings and cities were all built and maintained by men."
Did the lady just say 'men' and women? Hahaha do u smell the fear!
Good riddance # Me Too
"""When women and men"" lol bc men are coming forward in the 10s of thousands"
"I consider myself resonable and would he willing to discuss the problem, I am not and have never been an abuser, I wouldn't even date coworkers when I was single, and as a Manager never even let my mind go there with a subordinate, or let myself be in a compromising situation that could be misinterpreted. I must say the attitude expressed by some would shut the conversation  down, I would stop listening, and no progress would be made, and I'm a man willing to say there is a problem with some men and the treatment of women."
Their going to stop hiring women then what will be the complaints?  If it's harassment then file your complaint but the backlash will soon be evident.
"Is it me, or does Chris Hayes at the end of these MSNBC videos sound like he's saying ""Just Blow Me""... Ironic?"
"too much politics, just create your own business, done."
Ya think?
Women talking about men nothing new
Yeah they will ruin you when they lie and its  ok and man up lol
I work with women all the time it's just in my line of work . I'm a cna I take care of the elderly.  I've never had a problem but there are alot of witnesses everywhere and I guess those I work with are good people and don't lie like that anyway
yep they want to get alllll tha kings men
Ruhie that what I and American wants to hear the millions of tax payers money and why can't they pay for their play moments That might be a set up job let them pay for there own problems we do.
#metoo$$
"Le seul comportement à avoir face à une victime, c'est de lui dire : je t'écoute et on va enquêter rapidement"
"Fourest : ""je suis journaliste""

Affirme des choses non sourcées et généralise abusivement des cas exceptionnels comme s'ils méritaient un livre médiatique grand publique.

On a déjà des discussions publiques dans les milieux militants et connexes pour discuter de ça et chercher des solutions et s'imaginer que des jeunes militantes et militants seraient pas armés pour éviter de tomber dans les abus c'est mal les connaitre.
Tout comme s'imaginer que si on est plus expérimentés on tombe forcément moins dans les excès ou les biais.

Alerter sur les abus c'est bien si c'est dans la nuance et traiter de façon proportionnelle à la réalité du problème mais pourquoi en faire un livre qui sert la soupe au publique réactionnaire ? Jamais ça ne touchera le publique qui pourrait bénéficier de l'alerte qu'on prétend lancer et au contraire ça donne des prétextes et des armes aux antiféministes pour lutter contre le féminisme qu'ils n'accepteront jamais.

On peut percevoir des réaction comme étant extrémistes ou dogmatiques alors qu'on est dans divers biais qui nous font voir des choses bien différentes de la réalité. Surtout quand on prend de l'âge et qu'on se met a déconsidérer les jeunes parce qu'ils seraient excessifs alors qu'ils n'ont rien de différent des précédente générations et que c'est plutôt l'observateur ou l'observatrice qui n'a pas sut évoluée et progresser avec la société.

La position de Fourest semble tellement déconnectée de la réalité, semble plus dans un raisonnement abstrait que basé sur des réalité mesurées et confrontées a l'esprit critique pour éviter divers biais dont un des pires est le biais de modération.

Bon il serait un peu naïf de croire que Fourest n'a pas l'intelligence et la maitrise sociale pour constater que son travail médiatique pose problème d'un point de vue féministe. J'ai du mal a croire que éthiquement elle ne sacrifie pas (ou a déjà sacrifié) certains idéaux pour les bénéfices matériels et d'influence."
"Il faut qu'elle arrete de se poser en victime , elle qui differencie les morts d'enfants😢"
"""C'est l'enfer.""
Elle a fait plusieurs centaines de plateau télé pour vendre son livre, y a pire comme enfer."
"Personne ne semble oser critiquer un grand coupable dans toute cette histoire : l’institution judiciaire. A force de ne pas condamner, à force de nier les victimes et d’aider les coupables, la population en vient à vouloir se faire justice elle-même, avec ses propres moyens : les réseaux sociaux. Cela concerne éminemment l’affaire d’Outreau, dont le déroulé et le rôle terrible de m Dupont Morretti alimentent considérablement la défiance des gens vis à vis de l’institution."
"Que dit Caroline Fourest du fait qu'une écrasante majorité des plaintes soit classée sans suite, ""faute de preuves""?"
Comment apporter un quelconque  crédit à Caroline  Fourest qui dit à qui veut l'entendre qu'une mort palestinienne ne vaut pas une mort israélienne .....
"Caroline Fourest parle en son nom,n'a pas la légitimité de juger le bien-fondé des plaintes,des procédures et des actions du mouvement Metoo. 
Il y a une nécessité absolue à :
- accueillir écouter proteger et soutenir les victimes 
- s'opposer à la culture du viol et à toutes les violences systèmiques
- développer des reseaux d'investigations judiciaires, actions de formation et de prevention, accompagnements médico-scolaires et sociaux"
On connaît Fourest il n'y a pas de commentaire à faire
Caroline Fourest c'est l'exemple type de l'effet Dunning-Kruger. Une personne incompétente qui tend à surestimer son niveau de compétence !
"Fourest monte en epingle quelques cas exceptionnels marginaux, comme si c'etait le probleme principal. C'est malhonnete"
je peux lui trouver 3 exemples de proches  femmes qui ont commit diverses formes de mensonges a ce sujet  si elle cherche des témoignages de fausses accusations
Lol.elle c'était fait bannir sur France 2 dans l'émission de Ruquier pour mensonges repetes...bref elle n'a pas changé
"""Les femmes ne mentent pas plus que quiconque"". Merci en tant qu'avocate d'avoir apporté cette précision..."
"Parmi les ""victimes"" de dénonciation nommées par C. Fourest, il y a un producteur de cinéma, A. Terzian, qui a versé plus de 200000 € à C. Fourest pour un projet de film, qui -heureusement - ne s'est pas fait. Hasard ?"
"4:52: ""Dans 99% des cas ce Je t'écoute doit être un Je te crois"", Ok Caroline donc l'intérêt de faire une livre sur les 1% c'est quoi exactement? On rappelle les chiffres officiels : 1% des cas de viol/ agression son traités. Le reste ça tombe en non lieu ou la plainte n'est pas déposée (pour tout un tas de raison que MeToo a mis en éclairage). C'est ça la Réalité aujourd'hui."
"Je suis une jeune femme (24 ans), j'ai une amie qui a été agressée sexuellement par un homme, en voyant toutes les procès de viol qui se tiennent depuis le mouvement Metoo, cela me fait perdre espoir en les hommes quelques fois (je ne vous le cache pas), mais je reste convaicu qu'il peut y avoir certaines dérives du mouvement. Il faut vraiment être stupide pour le nier. Je suis certaine que la plupart des personnes en commentaires n'ont pas lu le livre, perso je suis en train de le lire et je peux vous dire que Caroline Fourest est une féministe qui défend les droits des femmes et les aide dans leur démarche à porter plainte.
Je suis sûr que la plupart des personnes en commentaire n'en ont pas fait autant pour la cause des femmes. Même petite, Caroline Fourest a écouté et aidé une de ses amies quand celle-ci a été agressée sexuellement par son père.
Mettre en doute sa loyauté envers cette cause est pour moi intolérable.
Vous devriez lire le bouquin avant de commenter..."
Fourest : 🤮🤮🤮🤮
comparer une main aux fesses au viol de mazan c'est quand même pas très respectueux pour cette pauvre femme qui en a été victime - il n'y a plus de nuance .
"Fourest représente la définition l'opportunisme. Elle sait très bien que certaines personnes sont fatiguées d'entendre la succession  des plaintes d'agressions sexuelles (qui résulte de la libération de la parole) et se sentiront rassurées à travers son ouvrage. 
Je lui repose de faire dans deux ans un ouvrage intitulé ""Comment le mouvement me too a été étouffé ""."
"Une main aux fesses vaut 5 ans de prison alors que des centaines de milliers de dealers de cocaïne se promènent dans les rues tranquillement, relaxés ou laissés en liberté! Cette avocate est une honte."
"Caroline Fourest n'a aucun autre but à chaque fois que de faire le buzz pour aller faire le tour des plateaux. Elle est prête à tout pour ça, méprisable."
"Pour quelques uns accusés à tort, contre 94% de plaintes pour viol classées sans suite, je sais où est mon camp."
"Caroline Fourest est une meilleure avocate que Anne Bouillon qui ""ne croit pas"" la sincerite de Caroline Fourest qui pose de vraies questions si notre societe ne veut pas se transformer en tribunal sur les reeaux qui, comme nous le savons,  est un receptacle qui peut mettre en danger ses adeptes."
"Si un homme, ou une femme, venait voir cette avocate en lui expliquant qu'on l'accuse à tort de harcèlement, j'aimerais connaître son sentiment."
"Les conséquences de son livre vont être dramatiques. Les femmes ont tellement galéré à se faire entendre, et elle, elle débarque de nulle part pour dire des conneries, alors qu'elle se prétend journaliste ! Tu ne te prétends pas de droite, mais tu vas être très étonnée d'être appréciée de ce côté d'un coup. Le même discours que Thaïs Escuffion"
"Bravo Caroline fourest, et courage, de te battre contre la bêtise de masse. Quand l'avocate dit qu'il faut croire sur parole les femmes qui se disent victimes de viol, sans enquête sans jugement ca ne choque personne ?
Elle affirme qu'elle ne""connait aucune femme qui accuserai à tort pour salir une réputation..."" Merci de ton témoignage mais on s'en fou. Et donc on ne peut pas imaginer qu'une femme cupide sans honneur sans foi ni loi accuse un homme pour le plumer ? Ca ne peut pas exister?
Mais quelle faiblesse d'esprit. Il faudrait vraiment que les études supérieures, basent leur sélection plus sur de l'intelligence plutôt que sur la mémoire, ce n'est pas possible de voir de tels avocats, il faut arrêter de donner du pouvoir à des gens avec aussi peu de jugeote."
pour moi on est coupable quand on a été juger coupable  par la justice !!!!! la vindicte populaire non merci !!!!!
"Il y a clairement très peu de victimes qui sont mal intentionnées. En revanche, il y a des personnes, peu importe leur genre, qui ont des problèmes psys qui peuvent les entrainer à imaginer, exagérer, mélanger. Il y a des phénomènes de foules où les gens portent des jugements sur des personnes dont ils viennent d'apprendre l'existence. Il faut donc s'interdire de négliger la parole des victimes, comme ça a été trop souvent fait, parce que ça nous arrangerait. La parole des victimes est à écouter et à prendre au sérieux. Mais à l'heure des fake news, on ne croit pas aveuglément, non."
Mais c'est vraiment si compliqué de comprendre ce que dit Caroline Fourest ?
"Tellement d’accord avec Caroline Fourest : on est rendu dans une société qui juge avant le tribunal, qui jette en pâture des personnes avant que le jugement ne soit rendu, qui se sont retrouvés harcelés alors qu’ils étaient innocents.
Vraiment soulagé de la prise de conscience du phénomène metoo, que les victimes d’agressions sexuelles soient désormais écoutées dans les commissariats.
Le problème ce sont les prises d'opinions publiques sur l’émotionnel pour faire le buzz, les jugements hâtifs avant même le début de la moindre enquête ou que l’accusé n’ait pu donner sa propre version des faits.
Bref oui au féminisme, non au féminisme extrémiste fermé au moindre débat."
"Une main !!?? Pas une agression ,voyons.... plutôt un compliment ! Les affreuses ne risquent rien ! C'est tellement évident. 😂🎉🎉"
Pour qu'il y ait abus de pouvoir il faudrait que le pouvoir soit de notre côté.
Oui faut condamné sévèrement les pointeurs mais c'est pas simple quand c'est parole contre parole sans aucune autre preuve et c'est pas au médias de jouer au procureur comme madame rousseau qui dénonce bayou a c a vous sans plainte n'y rien sa rappelle staline ou les délateurs pendant la seconde guerre mondiale
"Madame Caroline Fourest, vous êtes très courageuse, merci de prendre le parti de la nuance et de ce qui vous semble juste. C'est justement en denonçant les dérives du mouvement que vous renforcez son intégrité, sa crédibilité, son importance. Merci ❤"
"je ne suis ni pour l'une ni pour l'autre mais pour les victimes et toutes les victimes des deux cotés.
Ne pas vouloir admettre et concevoir que certain(s) certaine(s) puisse(nt) instrumentaliser une accusation en faux. C'est la même chose que généraliser et dire que tout les hommes sont des violeurs. 
La lois ne prévoirait pas le délit de diffamations et de faux témoignages si tout le monde disaient la vérités"
"La duplicité de Fourest consiste à ce que d'un côté,dans des débats comme ceux-ci, on entend quelque chose d'étayé.

D'un autre côté en revanche, son livre fournit aux pourfendeurs réactionnaires de Metoo un argumentaire pour etayer leurs propres idées. Et c'est celà que diffuse un tel livre dans la société.

Et cela, elle ne met pas d'énergie à venir le corriger, au contraire."
"Tu vois, l'affaire M'bappé est un bel exemple de ce que Fourest raconte. C'est devenu un peu facile, le viol est devenu une arme par des gens mal intentionnés, et cela dessert ceux qui sont vraiment victimes de viols."
"Pourquoi tant de violence envers Caroline Fourest, c'est un point de vue intéressant qu'il faut avoir l'honnêteté d'écouter et essayer de comprendre avant de le démolir"
"Fourest qui trouvent normal que les bombardements israéliens provoquent des dégâts collatéraux, trouve inconcevable que certaines accusations sont le fait de femmes malades et tout à fait minoritaires. Et du coup ce petit nombre qui doit être condamné justifie de discréditer tout le mouvement féministe et Meetoo en particulier."
Les commentaires négatifs face au simple appel à la nuance en dise long sur la société actuelle.
"Il faudrait que cette avocate se renseigne davantage sur les fausses accusations (en justice ou par la voix médiatique) en France et ailleurs, il y en a un bon nombre disponible en quelques clics."
J'admire cette journaliste qui essai d'être objective.
Honteux la manière dont Catherine Fourest se victimise
Une avocate écoute avec inquiétude un discours qui rappelle à la prudence devant les accusations ! La justice est entre de bonnes mains.
"Je comprends tout à fait le malaise ressenti par Madame Fourest pour le vivre moi-même sur les forums de discussion. Dès que vous essayez de prendre un peu de recul par rapport à un sujet quelconque et d'y apporter de la nuance, dès que vous refusez de prime abord de hurler avec les loups en somme, on vous soupçonne de faire partie de l'autre camp. Vous vous faites accuser comme si réfléchir constituait un délit. Il semble difficile pour beaucoup de sortir de la vision simpliste et rassurante du camp du Bien contre le camp du Mal..."
Je trouve que l’interview coupe trop souvent les invités
"Caroline Fourest a raison de questionner le mouvement ""me too"", ses possibles dérives et sa récupération à des fins parfois politiques/électoralistes. Quand on sacralise un sujet, il n'est plus permis de le questionner et c'est alors la fin de la démocratie. Merci à elle pour, une fois de plus, son courage et son audace."
Caroline Fourest est brillante et je salue son courage face aux contresens permanents de ce qu’elle dénonce. C’est une vérité de dire qu’il y a des hiérarchies dans les abus que subissent les femmes. Mettre de la nuance et de la précision apporte au contraire de la force au mouvement meetwo qui est le mouvement sociétal le plus important depuis…ouh…. Il n’y a jamais eu un mouvement de société aussi important. Je pense que les deux femmes sont d’accord mais l’avocate est partie bille en tête en faisant un faux procès à la grande féministe qu’est C. Fourest. C’est dommage.
"Je trouve les commentaires sur Caroline Fourest passablement delirants et donc inquietants...croyez vous vraiment que cela mette en danger le mouvement ""me too"" et pensez vous reellement que "" me too"" ne puisse pas etre interrogé ? Pourquoi ?"
Et ben tout ça parce qu'elle veut mettre un peu de nuances...ça en dit long sur la société actuelle...
Caroline Fourest 😊👍
"Juste ta gueule Caroline, je crois que c'est la bonne expression, et faire de l'argent avec, je trouve ça pitoyable !"
Madame l'avocate ce n'est pas parce que ca ne fait pas partie de votre quotidien que ca n'est pas une realite.
Le feminisme a geométrie variable...
Pourquoi elle écrit un livre sur ce sujet ? On s'en fout. Ça fait avancer quelle cause ? Aucune. Caroline Fourest est hors sol.
"Elle a raison, Madame Fourest. Peut-on prendre une seule de ses paroles pour dire qu'elle a tort ?
Par leurs excès parfois psychotiques, les ""Me Too"" sont du caca qui détruisent les rapports entre les êtres humains."
Bravo et merci à maître Bouillon
"Bravo Madame Fourest, toujours dans la nuance et démasquant les revers de toute démggie."
"Elle raconte n'importe quoi sur Outreau, les victimes, encore aujourd'hui maintiennent leurs accusations"
"Mais du coup, il sert à quoi son livre ?"
"8:00 ""Les femmes ne mentent pas "" effrayant. Une illuminée."
"Entièrement d’accord avec Caroline Fourest!
C’est beau de voir une femme faire une « not all men » 😂
Sa réflexion a du fond. L’instrumentalisation parfois intégriste du mouvement « me too » pose question."
"Caroline Fourest ne fait que nous prévenir et nous alerter sur les retour de bâton potentiel, comme elle l'a toujours fait . Et honnêtement je préfère que sa vienne d'une féministe que d'une personne qui est contre ce mouvement . Le point essentiel ce n'est pas de ne pas croire les victimes mais de réfléchir, pour les journaliste, à la médiatisation d'une affaire qui au font n'en n'est pas une, et ainsi les 1% vont décrédibiliser les 99% restant .
La preuve en est que nous pouvons avoir des débat entre Humaniste, et qu'il n'y a, pour le moment, pas de débat contre ce mouvement mais juste contre ces dérives potentiel"
Elle veut faire du buzz et de l’argent … l’inviter sur tous les plateaux participent à diffuser une parole nauséabonde qu’est la sienne dans tous les sujets qu’elle traite…
Elle zoom sur moins d'1% des cas et probablement moins pour en faire un bouquin. C'est très inquiétant. Elle fait son business sur des cas de niche.
violences faites aux enfants aux bébés par la femme par la maman par la nounou c'est honteux ignoble criminelle
"Le rôle de l'avocat ce n'est de faire émerger la vérité. L'origine du terme est celui qui porte la voix.

Croire et douter c'est la seule posture intellectuelle qui permet de tendre vers la vérité."
"J'ai toujours admiré Caroline Fourest pour son courage. Ici encore dans son nouveau livre, elle prouve qu'elle n'a pas peur d'aller à contre-courant de la bien-pensance « MeToo » qui érige la victimisation en norme.  Pour moi, ce débat est biaisé dès le départ. Face à Caroline Fourest on a une avocate dont le business est de défendre les victimes, aussi bien les victimes qui ont subis une réelle agression sexuelle ou un viol, que celles qui sont en mal de reconnaissance, qui cherchent plus prosaïquement un gain financier ou qui sont inconscientes de leur ambiguïté vis à vis des hommes. A ses côtés on a flanqué un journaliste mâle pour donner une caution masculine au débat.
Plutôt que de défendre l'idée qu'il est toujours salutaire de prendre du recul et d'avoir un regard critique vis à vis de toutes les formes de croisades, la réaction de ces deux intervenants sous-entend au contraire que c'est un crime de lèse-majesté que de remettre en question la victimisation de certaines femmes."
"Non. Non et non. Les présumées victimes, je refuse de les croire sur leur simple parole. 
J'ai le devoir de les écouter, voire de les aider à prouver, etc. 
Mais les croire a priori non.
Elles sont présumées victimes jusqu'au jugement coupable d'un présumé innocent. 
Si on sort de ça, on sort de l'état de droit."
"Bonjour,
Ce qui me saute aux yeux lorsque j'entends ces deux personnes debattre c'est que leurs propos collent parfaitement à la fonction de chacune.

La journaliste désire apporter un éclaircissement sur un sujet de société. Elle se défend de denoncer abusivement un auteur de délit ou de crime en pronant la modération et en se laissant le temps de la réflexion avant d'engager sa parole en jetant un nom d'auteur de ces infractions dans l'arène.

L'avocate, elle, accueille toutes les paroles de victime et ne les remet pas en question, c'est normal. C'est sa fonction d'avocate, elle defend quoi qu'il arrive et délègue la decision au magistrat qui aura à juger la chose.

Le probleme, à mon avis, est de proposer un debat entre ces deux intervenantes dont, a priori, les avis ne sont pas conciliables pour les raisons exposées.

Ou plutôt d'opposer à Mme Fourest, puisque c'est son livre qui est le sujet de l'émission, une personne qui ne peut soutenir une autre voie que celle de la défense sans distinction des personnes qui se designent comme victimes de ce genre de faits."
"Les néo-féministes ne comprennent pas que le combat de Fourest est au contraire hyper utile pour le mouvement meetoo, car les anti meetoo se serviront toujours du moindre écart et de la moindre instrumentalisation du mouvement."
Il y a  de vraies victimes et il y aussi un vertige Meeto Mytho.
"on dirait que tous ces gens n ont pas entendu parler de l affaire d outreau, et de ces vies gachées,car la parole des enfants etaient sacrée et le doute ne devait pas exister"
"Cette avocate est bornée. 
La démarche de Caroline Fourest est rationnelle et responsable."
Oui mais c était pas 1 pouce😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂EDF
"Le ""Je te crois"" est une parole prononcée dans le domaine de la foi, du religieux. C'est la soumission à une parole divine qui ne peut souffrir, au risque d'être excommunié, d'une remise en cause, un questionnement, un débat contradictoire.  La formule est inappropriée dans une affaire où les féministes réclament justice. Puisque pour rendre la justice, il faut qu'il y ait un débat contradictoire qui amène la preuve mais aussi qui conteste les faits.  Et s'il est tellement difficile d'aborder la justice avec des affaires d'agressions sexuelles, toutes les parties, en ce y compris les avocats, doivent se questionner sur le rôle systémique qu'ils tiennent dans cette institution."
"Beaucoup de sottises,  peu de rigueur intellectuelle,  un opportunisme éhonté  ,  pas mal de mensonges et d'approximations ,mais quand va - t - on cesser d'offrir des temps de plateau à  Caroline Fourest dès qu' elle nous fait un petit caca  nerveux afin qu'elle en fasse son beurre ?"
"Comment a t’elle pu oser dire cette phrase à Caroline Fourest ? Pour une avocate, on ne peut pas penser que ça lui à échapper comme ça oups pardon hein…"
"""les femmes ne mentent pas plus que quiconque"" ...et donc mentent autant que les hommes. Tout est dit ! Bravo Caroline Fourest d'avoir le courage de porter un discours de réflexion et de nuance, face au militantisme politique partisan, dont notre société a besoin ! 👌"
"Il est inutile de discuter avec elle.Un peu comme avec les Cons.Incapable de changer d'avis,de remise en question,de méa Culpa."
"Merci Madame Caroline Fourest pour vos propos et écrits , équilibrés ."
"Nombre des accusation à tort ? exemple de femme qui s'est enrichi  pour de fausse accusations ? 
cette femme a écrit ce bouquin pour vouloir se faire des copains agresseurs et leur donné des excuses à leur violence"
"Le ""printemps républicain ""..."
mytho pas metoo la fourest
"Ouaiiiisss, elle est contente Fourest, elle a réussi son business, et les médias qui l'ont tous reçus l'y ont bien aidée."
"Les réacs parlent toujours de présomption d'innocence (ce qui, dans le cas de viols, signifie ""présomption de mensonge"" de la part de la victime, soit dit en passant). Le souci de la justice, c'est ""surtout ne pas prendre le risque de condamner un innocent"". C'est très louable, personne ne songerait à critiquer cela. Mais on ne parle jamais du risque de ne pas condamner un coupable. Et donc, de condamner la victime à voir son agresseur impuni, et son statut de victime non reconnu. Jusqu'à la fin de ses jours."
Caroline est nuancée et réaliste. L'avocate fait son beurre sur les outrance langagière. J espère que ses consultations sont gratuites et qu elle ne vide pas les poches des victimes pour plaider?
Quel courage Caroline face a cette meute wokiste! Tout est dans la nuance.
Catherine Fourest contrairement au vin...vieillit mal !
Quand on commence par un oui mais c’est foutu
"Caroline Fourest est une journaliste (dans le vrai sens du terme, pas ce que les journalistes sont devenus) et est objective. C'est fatiguant de voir des présentateurs résumer un livre de 300 pages à une phrase. Elle apporte de la nuance et de la réflexion, alors que les débats de télé cherchent à faire du fast food ""vous êtes pro-machin à 100%"" .... non, mais je pointe ""ah donc vous êtes anti"".......Caroline Fourest, j'aime à penser que la majorité des auditeurs entendent la nuance de votre réflexion. Merci encore pour votre travail"
"Bravo Caroline, enfin un peu de raison"
"Le courage de la nuance et de la réflexion chez Caroline Fourest, face au catastrophisme de l'idéologue militante bien connue Anne Bouillon... Bravo ! 👍"
Très courageuse Fourest de chercher la nuance sur un sujet aussi casse gueule !
Catherine Fourest aurait pu se dispenser de cet ouvrage.
Une main aux fesses ; on appelait ça un hommage ! .. Quel bordel aujourd'hui
"« Ce Que j’écoute doit être un je te crois à 99%» , oui donc ça vaut vachement le coup d’écrire un livre pour ces 1%… ah pardon t’as l’hypothèque de ta maison à racheter sur le dos des femmes qui se font agresser."
A part Caroline Fourest vous avez d'autres invités?
L'avocate a fini de me convaincre d'aller acheter le livre de Caroline Fourest
Getting in trouble for keeping distance from women is Far better than getting in trouble for sexual harassment
"I rather not be in the 2%,so don't fault me being extra careful."
#metoo has been the greatest recruiting tool for MGTOW.
One of the craziest ways to have your life ruined is by having a female colleague show interest in you and then you decline out of being professional. They really don't take rejection well.
I love how the misandrist just lets her toxic femininity breathe. Men getting falsely accused of sexual assault are literally by all over the place. But hey it's so small and negligible meaning it doesn't exist whatsoever.
Let's say there were a bowl of M&Ms and I told you that only 2% were poisoned. Would you eat any?
"their empathy for what amounts to mental health issue for the men is amazing. Men feeling stressed, and fear in the work place, and they could not care less. overwhelming number of workplace suicide are men, and their advice is just get over it."
Feminists have proven they can be dentrimental to men’s jobs and well being.
"It's not about false accusations. It's about ""he flirted with me once now i will ruin his life""."
"So the 2% is supposed to mean, ""Don't worry - if you're accused, there's a 98% chance you're guilty and your career is over."" We should all feel better now."
"Well she failed to mention that sexual harassments claims are almost always entirely  based on testimony.  Meaning that regardless of guilt, the accusation is more than enough to result in dire life ruining consequences for the accused.  Funny this lady precludes that fact from her argument.  Thus, mens refusal to be alone with women under any circumstances is a very rational and pragmatic response to the current situation."
If a man is in a room with a woman for a few hours working and afterwards she accuses you of harassment let's say because of a misunderstanding or her lying the guy is done for. He did nothing but just the accusation will destroy him
2%?!    GTFOH
"Never take advice from a woman about how to act around other women. 
Just avoid them all."
To claim 2% is an outright lie. Sexual harassment is the one crime where the accuser is also judge and jury.
"My chances of dying in a car crash are less than .02%, but I still wear a seat belt."
If your in the 2% innocent collom it can destroy your life so yeah it's not as easy as it sounds.
I love how feminists sit there and claim that they are trying to help everyone when all of the policy they create so clearly favors women.
Save yourself. Play it safe and don't even tempt fate by being alone with a woman you work with.
"Wow, men are afraid of being falsely accused and you people say they are panicking, should learn how to behave and that they are committing a crime.
Jesus, what a way to make things worse."
Your statistics are extremely questionable.
"You can't force male managers to mentor female employees  and it isn't discrimination to use the mike pence rule
God bless Mike pence and Billy Graham"
2% naaaaa more 99.9 % when shes in her period of false accusation
According to these two it's once again Men's fault. Way to go blaming men for every problem.
"my brother who works in a small IT company in NC told me he is having trouble finding a gf, so I told why not ask one of your coworkers out, and he told me he would never do that because one of his male coworkers asked a female coworker out, she causally told him that she is not interested and he replied ok and never talked about that again, a week later he receives a mail from hr that he is being fired for making sexual advances at workplace... ofcourse men are terrified of women, that guy drives for doordash now as he was unable to find work anywhere else"
"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice  ...."
2% is just the ones where the guy could prove his innocence. What about the false accusations where the man couldn’t prove his innocence? It’s definitely higher than 2%.
"I'm an employer of my (and another person's) company, and we both specifically avoid hiring women for numerous reasons, one of them being the false accusations of sexual harassments.  Yes, we accept applications from women due to legal reasons, but we haven't hired even one female employee in the 11 years the company ran.  It's just not worth it, unless the female applicant has some really impressive resume (they don't, since high level women don't apply to small companies like mine)."
"Most men wouldn’t even speak to a woman at work, let alone ask them out. I’d rather be single and keep my job than get #MeToo’d."
The problem with citing FBI data is that it keeps track of accusations which go through the legal system. They aren't keeping track of false statements in HR complaints.
I have a bowl with 100 skittles. 2 are poisoned. Would you eat the whole bowl? Nope. Not a chance.
"Love the shaming language Wymyn insist on using. Man ""scared"". No actually Men are SMART for avoiding them."
Mgtow shield wall is up
"That woman just lied.  False Sexual assault claims may be at 2%,;  but sexual assault and sexual harassment are not the same thing.  Women claim ANYTHING as harassment..."
Why do Women need to be mentored by Men Where are the feminists
Notice that they are not citing any law against refusing to be friendly to women colleagues?
That's the proof that woman really think that nothing is ever their fault 🤣
"suing a man for rapr after 5+years should not br allowed if the ""victim"" was an ADULT when it happened."
I want a law that gives men the right to wear a body cam at work or to force employers to install video and audio recordin equipment in every work space except the bathroom obviously.
"Keep them away from me.

#NOTME"
Men are afraid that they are going to be falsely accused of inappropriate behavior after women falsely accuse men of inappropriate behavior? I'm SHOCKED! SHOCKED I say!
"This video is beyond stupid. They completely missed the mark here. Good job guys! 
😂👏👏👏😐
Just wow."
Feminists the greatest recruiting tool for MGTOW.
"As an outsider and having seen how the FBI at work the past four years.  I would only trust them to give me the correct time, twice a day, with a broken clock!"
"It’s the fact that man don’t want their behavior to be taken as flirting or harassment simply by talking to you how they would talk to any other friend, it seems like a lot of women especially in todays society feel men are always trying to “get with them” but that’s not always the case. Also if something was to happen and she falsely accused you it’s her word against yours and NOBODY is believing what you say over a women especially now so men just avoid interaction altogether."
"Okay, say I'm a man, now you are telling me that almost all accusations of sexual impropriety against men are true (98%)
So I should have no reason to worry about interacting with women, after all, why would any woman want to hurt me?
This is truly chilling."
So the best solution is have companies with only females and companies with only males and let see which company can last more than 1 week
The point is that 2% of false allegations is very high. You do not want to be the one guy that has to deal with the 50th woman that has the power to destroy your life. You’ll be guilty until you can prove to be innocent. You cannot defend yourself and be fired. Stay safe. Never have meetings with only one woman. Always have witnesses.
"Sure, I trust the FBI, just about as much as I trust NBC.........so long."
Male managers should not have 1-1s with women PERIOD.
"wow... just wow...
people are worried. and we should blame them for being worried eh?"
Men keep protecting your self.  Cameras / witnesses
"You're very hungry and handed a bag of 50 peanuts but told there is one peanut in there (2%) that has a neurotoxin which can make you violently ill or leave you paralyzed - are you going take a chance and eat some? Not likely.  That's what men face with interacting with women in the work place - it's not about being "" afraid "" it's about taking sensible precautions to safeguard their jobs and reputation."
"I just don't want to be in the 2% , is that too hard to accept?"
2% its really 90%
It is their choices whether men will mentor women or not. You can't say that this is crime or violation. All women betray men when their needs are fulfilled by men like mentoring.
2:02 - men are even get punished now for being afraid. This woman is insane.
"Can someone explain why so many people disliked this?

Edit: Maybe because these people are undermining the power of women who can easily use this power to blackmail men or ruin their life?"
Nope! We are tired of being accused and having lives ruined over baseless accusations.
This is completely not true because as a 15 year old I was accused and it broke my world and how I saw it and as a male this is one of the many things why I have trust issues at a young age.
One false accusation is one false accusation too many.
Has to be higher than 2% false claims - I know several and they were all false
If you are a woman or a man who wants a relationship with somebody from work you already know instead of dating strangers you don't know you are out of luck because trying in even the vaguest of ways is prohibited.
she is more threatening calling out laws and forbidding men to say no...
I think that 2% statistic is bull
"How's this fair, women basically pointing a weapon to men's head do whatever I say and when we try to avoid you, you try to get us in trouble pulling us into your issues.
Lose lose situation how is that fair?"
"Tell me, cultural historian Lynn Parramore or company leader Gene Marks, or anyone else who made the claims in this video: If I, as a man, lose my job and my ability to get future jobs because my reputation is shot by a false report of sexual harassment - one which *will* destroy my reputation, for sure - will you be able to offer me a job? Or support me through any legal trial that takes place, at least monetarily? Work to help clear me of such false accusations? Or will you just wash your hands and say, ""F it, he's just one of the 2% who got nicked and let the courts decide if he's guilty""?

Heck, do you even walk the talk you make? Because, beyond the facts and figures, our lives are on the line here."
so fear is illegal now? we know that any accusation will be unconditionally believed and your life will be destroyed.
"for the sake of argument, even if there are only 2% false allegations, that 1 in 50 chance will nuke a guy's career and forever smear his reputation. you would never jump out of an airplane if there was a 1 in 50 possibility the parachute would not open."
A simple gaze can make her 'uncomfortable'....and make you lose your job
She said only 2% - the fear is being in that 2%
"(Sigh) Being lectured again!!? Ladies, this is what you wanted, you caused the damage, can't change your minds now. Oh, and by the way, 2% false accusations is way off, the number of false accusations is much much higher. Also, notice the subtle threat of it being ""illegal"" to avoid women in the workplace. Gawd!! They just won't stop!!"
I'm not afraid to work with women because Im unprofessional. I am afraid because the accusation is all it takes.
"A false accusation doesn't need to be taken to court have you ever dealt with a crazy ex? You all talking nonsense.  

They aren't refusing because they are women, they are refusing because of potential lawsuits even when innocent."
"Ok. I've been hearing alot about the work environment. But what I haven't heard about is the damage in every other area of life. And I have only heard about ""white males in power."" But what about your average middle class men who do have moral compasses who have been taught to respect women but they fear that one mistake and they'll be stripped of everything? You can't be so laser focused on a crusade that you don't pay attention to who gets hurt in the process. And don't even get me started on the dilemmas that BLACK men face. Me Too has done many good, and I support women demanding to be put on the same platform. But the the movement has single-categorized everybody. There is a difference between those that feel they're entitled, invincible, & untouchable and those that are human beings and have errors. They shouldn't suffer. We can't overlook the damages that Me Too caused."
"My employer refuses to hire female employees.
I love working in this environment"
"Did all men hear that? Its illegal to avoid women. Any tickets left for flight to Mars, I'm going home."
mgtow around the world is holding the line
It’s not backlash it’s self preservation ya women did it to yourselves.
"I don't think men and women are made to work together. Traditionally, men worked with men and vice versa. Go to the oilfield and it's all men and there are never many issues. As a maintenance technician at a hotel, I found that the dynamic with so many women around became a problem for me with advances, drama and jealousy. This led me to seek jobs far away from an office. I prefer working with men only or solo as the drama is almost nothing. No need to tip toe around people's insecurities or feelings in those environments. Risk of getting into legal trouble is almost nothing as well."
"Know what else is illegal? Making a false accusation. Didn't stop these harridans, now did it?"
"Interact with women in your workplaces only when needed. Otherwise you're better off avoiding them. After work, don't even think about hanging out. If you need to work late, make sure a camera is recording. You'll thank me later."
"I know this will happen, all men should be respectful and careful."
"Nate Parker of ""Birth of a nation"" was a man that was vindicated 15 years before the movie came out. He was found not guilty and proven innocent. So interesting that that case was brought up right before the release of birth of a nation just as his career was jump starting. They wanted him to apologize or have sympathy for the victim that falsely accused him. He did not have to show remorse for something that was traumatizing for him and almost destroyed him. The end result? He no longer in Hollywood. No studio will touch him. Stay away from women in the work place."
"Anyone who doesn't take steps to mitigate risk is just asking for trouble. If you let your guard down and make any sort of a comment  outside the strict bounds of work related topics it will come back to harm you eventually. Women hold grudges, they look for lapses, they look for anything that might serve as a weapon they can use maybe not today but when it works to their best advantage.  Do not take a meeting one on one with a woman. Never close the door when meeting with a woman. Never travel with a woman. Never dine alone with a woman. Dating is dating and work is work. Never confuse the two or assume that a woman can be trusted not to screw you over if it advances her interests. Personal experience talking here."
"""There is a clear line"" proceeds not to talk about where this line is precisley. And  feminist won't ever define it because that would mean there would be gender roles."
The Bret Cavanaugh case minimized the #metoo movement!
How is this video still up on YouTube and not been deleted
"Organization isn't going to help men, when someone falsely accused..."
"“Breaking the law.”?

Seriously, GFY."
"5 years ago in my early 20s I would have loved to hire women. 

Now in my late 20s I would never. Never. Ain’t that funny?"
Anytime there's music in the background..........you know you're being lied to
"2% of false r*pe accusations is already too much . a friend of mine got falsely accused of that years ago. it has traumatized him to this day . i don't like the way this woman is downplaying it , not to mention the veiled threat against already anxious people that they may face the law . my advice , when you start your company , pick in advance your entire staff , this way you cannot be blackmailed to hire anyone you don't want to hire /"
2% of false accusations does not look that bad until you fall in that category
Is fear a punishable offence?
"Don't marry them, don't hire them, don't work with them. Protect yourself"
Yeah lady?  What about mens safety at the workplace?
Nice try with this trap. Not buying this. Men stay on point and don't give in. Stay away from the women in the work place. Don't even look at them.
"21000 views, 118 likes, now you know the dislike count. And by the way 2% of 1 billion is 20 million."
2%? ..... Make that 98% False accusations
"""Believe all women"" led to Amber Heard. Never again with that nonsense."
“Believe all woman” that’s the dumbest thing I’ve amber heard
"""Virgin until I was married and proud of it"" man that's refreshing to hear"
Agreed! My ex lied ..they believed at first..then her story fell apart..our children told the truth.. her true colors came out.. and she ended up getting arrested!! Sad but I was so thankful that the justice system worked!! Shame on anyone who lies to smear a decent human being! Meaning all cases are separate and can't just believe any group/ category..seek the truth in every single case!
"They say ""believe all women,"" when they can't even define what a woman is."
I was a virgin until I got married too and it was the best decision of my life!!!
"The saddest part is after the woman is found to have lied, she gets no punishment and the man gets no reimbursement for the job, money, career he lost."
I 100% agree. There have been plenty cases were the woman was falsely accusing men of rape. Those men will never get rid of those accusations.
"""Virgin until married and proud of it"" - Takes balls to say that considering how many american trolls I encountered! Much respect! 💪🏻🇷🇴☦"
"Ben, my husband was slso a virgin. He remains the most honorable man I have ever met."
"""Believe all women"" and ""You can't define a Woman"" have somehow been said by the same group of people in the same political party. 
Ain't that wacky?"
"""Virgin until I was married and proud of it.""

My respect for him just went 📈📈📈📈📈"
"""I'm virgin until i got married ""
We exist guys, it's just that we don't usually use that as a brag

Damn now i want to brag with that"
The thing that bothers me most about ‘me too’ is when the woman is proven to have lied all the celebrities or politicians who came to her defence never apologize.
This man has a moral compass that is commendable.  God bless him and his conviction!
Women who lie and slander men need to go to prison for the same amount of time of a rape crime and it should be just as serious crime. just one more thing broken in the justice system?
"If we believe all women, then what do we do when one woman calls another woman a liar 🤔"
"No Ben, you are not the only man in America who is a virgin .... 39 years old and still waiting on the Lord to bless me with the joy and beauty of a God-centered, God-blessed marriage."
"I’m a female and I’m also waiting for marriage! So I’m happy that you also waited for marriage, not many people do that."
"You can hate Ben as much as you want, but you can't deny him because he is one of the few voices of reason."
“ you can’t believe all woman any more than u can believe all men “ agreed. With what’s mentioned in this vid really sheds a spotlight on what’s currently going on with the Amber heard and Johnny depp situation.
"""I am the only man in America who was a virgin until I got married and proud of it"" meanwhile, 28 year old virgin me doubting if I am American 🤔"
"When women get caught with false allegation they should get a minimum of 5 years. The man loses everything with one false allegation. His job, family, kids, ect..."
"As a woman, For heavens sake, Do Not believe all women. That is the craziest thing Ive ever heard."
"The whole ""believe all women"" idea worked so great for Disney, that they lost the entire Pirates series now. 😄"
"“Go ahead, tell everyone I hit you, they always believe the woman.” - My privileged-former girlfriend. She was just a moment. My two older sisters abused me my entire life, they are borderline sociopathic, a professor and guidance counselor. I keep my distance from all three, and they can all go to Hell."
"Feminists: ""Believe all women""
Patriarchy: ""What's a woman?""
Feminists: ""Ummm...."""
"I have never heared anybody say ""believe all women"" it is always rather ""believe the victim (untill proven otherwise)"" and it never refers to a court room but to everyday people interacting with the victim. It is supposed to protect actual victims from public abuse and mobbing."
"The moment I knew that ""Believe All Women"" was a lie was when my Ex said she loves me."
I wish I was made out of the same stuff as Ben Shapiro. He's completely brilliant and held up high moral standards for himself
"My son was a virgin until he got married at 25.  He always had girlfriends, but he practiced his Christian beliefs, which lost him a few gf's.  I'm very proud of him."
As a woman I know why all women should NOT be believed
My hubby was a virgin! He was 24 and we have been married over 30 years! Love you hubby!
The dude is just verbally and mentally talented
"I was a virgin till I married my wife, of twelve years now. Many coworkers/older men have told me they wish they had waited."
My admiration for Ben just went off the chart. A man that remained a virgin until marriage is a solid.
"To be a virgin until marriage is something that DEMANDS respect. You have mine, Ben."
“Believe all women” gave us women like Amber Heard and many others who took advantage of the #metoo movement. I’ll never understand how people can lie about things like that. Men also deserve to be heard and believed
My brothers are virgins and proud of it. Thanks Ben for advocating for men to be real men! It’s a beautiful thing when a man is a real man and woman is a real woman.
"My brother was stabbed my his female partner, she didn't even know why she did it! Two weeks in hospital with a punctured lung. So when people say men are the only abusers, it sends me nuts!"
"I remained a virgin till I was married as well Ben. For 27 years I remained one, and I can look my wife in the eyes and proudly say that she is the only woman that I've ever had a relationship in that manner with."
I got Johnny Depped by my ex. I'm glad the witch hunt against men is coming to an end and people are waking up without fear to speak out. You are my hero Ben Shapiro
Liberals: “Ben Shapiro hated women until his teenage years!”
I can guarantee you’re not the only man in America with that particular distinction
I am 17 and a virgin and plan to be till I'm married I am proud because it was very hard for me even being unpopular till 7th grade I had chances to lose it and I'm glad I didn't
"This is a piece of advice my parents gave me "" Don't believe anyone until they give you solid proof to do so. """
"Damn, a true sigma. Dude straight up said, “I was a virgin until I was married”."
"My son was accused of attempted murder, but his real crime was breaking up with her.  Her revenge was accusing him of trying to murder her.  It took $50K and three years to clear him.  There was no penalty for her."
"“Believe all women” tell that to my friend that was put in prison for rape. Only to be released 1.5 years later because they found out the girl lied, so that her long term boyfriend wouldn’t dump her for cheating on him."
"You're a man of principles. You're a good role model to our "" lost "" young generation that needs direction. Proud of you Ben. Keep up the good work. God bless you more!"
"When they say believe all women, just reply with two simple words, Amber Heard."
"“The only man in America who was a virgin until he got married and was proud of it” I’m sure he’s not the only man to have done this, but he’s probably one of the only men who was, in fact, proud of that"
The people that say believe all women never heard of the duke lacrosse scandal
The realism and backbone this man has is what needs to be taught to kids today! Speak the truth! Facts
This is literally the only  stuff on the internet that makes sense
"My mother is retired LEO, was the first person to educate me on this, blew my mind at a ""young"" age"
"I think it was Bill Burr who said ""Believe All Women!"" ""Um, have you met women?"" Lol"
"And then Amber Heard said, ""Me too!"""
"As a woman, yep. I agree with Ben here. Believe facts and not because of their gender, race or status. 

If a man abuses a woman, punish him as well as a woman abusing a man. No exemption."
"""believe all women when they claim a crime happened!""
or
""believe all men when they say 'okay, show me the proof'.""
one is insane, the other makes perfect sense."
“What about the psychos?” -Bill Burr
"As a woman, I am more inclined to believe a man over a woman."
We need many more people like Ben to go to the colleges and try and talk some sense into these brainwashed students nowadays. God bless you Ben!🙏🙌
"A smart man, an honorable man. God bless him. Amen."
"Ben is awesome .
He speaks logically which my brain is starving for.."
I agree with him on everything except one thing: he is not the only person to retain his virginity until marriage and be proud of it. My husband and I did the same thing and I personally know many others who make promises just like us and are proud to do so.
I love this man!!! He keeps it real. Virgin until married? Much respect. I'm Romanian orthodox and work.for  a kosher establishment.  This is awesome !!!
I'm a woman and I believe men way more than I do women.
"amber heard should be the face of why ""believe all women"" is bull malarkey."
"""Trust but verify."" - Horatio Caine (CSI Miami)"
This man is literally amazing.
"Same old concept ""don't believe everything you see on the Internet"" That can also be applied to people to any gender."
“Believe all woman” made me immediately think about the Amber Heard situation
Couldn’t agree with you more Ben.
I had my life destroyed by a liar. I may never fully recover.
"Basically the real root of the problem is... common sense. All these ""problems"" we keep running into is because it seems less and less people have common sense."
I can imagine how proud your parents are❤️👏🏻👏🏻God bless you Ben
"""Believe all women"" led to Amber Heard AND her lawyer

God, that women whom she calls a ""lawyer"" was insufferable"
"Believe woman that aren’t lying 
that would have been a better slogan"
"Honestly i agree with you just a lot
You are seen as right wing but you seem more left wing bc you actually love equality"
"The main reason I like YouTube over TikTok:
On YouTube, you have people who may not agree with Ben on everything but at least agreeing with Ben on this and people sharing their stories and people trying to console those people and we can all agree that this is a terrible thing. 
On TikTok, however, I guarantee at least half of these comments would be toxic, infuriating, and disgusting to look at. On TikTok, I guarantee you would see people who don't support Ben insulting and shitting on him instead of respecfully disagreeing with his stance. Also, I guarantee you would see a bunch of toxic ""feminist"" TikTok girls supporting ""the believe all women"" movement and invalidating the experiences of guys who have suffered at the hands of this #metoo shit. 

Trust me, as a frequent TikTok user and as someone who comes across these videos a lot, I promise you this is accurate, at least in comment sections for videos like this that I've seen."
"Johnny Depp has done a great service to men and the false accusations.  the me too movement is a disgrace to women.  When I was young I dealt with bottom touching, inapprpriate remarks with humour and walked away.  Trust me it stops."
"When a woman like Amber lies, it harms all women!  The liars need to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law!"
"Ben, you have brass balls! Respect!
Keep speaking the truth!
We need more courageous people like you!"
"2020: BELIEVE ALL WOMEN

2022: what's a woman?🤷"
"“Never trust women”
My mom"
Thank you Ben for speaking for the people in the back ! God your purity and thought process is refreshing. Gives me hope in this dark world 🌍
His mind is as fast and sharp as his tongue
"(Men) been told they should “Believe all women”... 
Truth is (Women) never “Believe all women”.."
Ahm...my husband was too...we both were...🥰
"I feel extremely inadequate when I hear ben speak. Damn, he's got his priorities straight"
I really miss the days when women were caring and compassionate people...
The more clips I see of him the more I wish he would run for President..  There's nothing we need more in this country than a president with a little bit of common Sense. And it seems like he has a whole lot of it.
I am so glad you speak the common sense truth.
As a woman I've learned in life that EVERYBODY lies
Ben was a virgin until marriage? Well that gives me a little bit of hope.
"Doubt should be had about statement that includes all, never, none, always, every."
Bro! I had tears suddenly! And a smile that someone spoke this afterall!😊

"Wow, anhand der Kommentare merkt man schon wie sehr wichtig dieses Thema ist und wie sehr unreflektiert unsere Gesellschaft ist."
"Ich als Mann würde gerne darauf hinweisen, dass nicht alle Männer keine Frauenrechte wollen..🤔
ich befürworte die Gleichberechtigung aller Menschen, immer und überall...🤷🏻‍♂️"
Man braucht nur die Kommentare hier zu lesen beängstigend.
Junge frauen tanzen zu suggestiven Bewegungen auf tiktok. Frauen finden only fans für sich. Das hat der Feminismus sehr sehr gut hinbekommen. Hut ab.
"04:03 ""... beschreibt eine Realität, der die meisten Frauen ausgesetzt sind..."" 

""1 von 3 Frauen erfährt in ihrem Leben häusliche Gewalt""

Daraus folgt: 1/3 = die meisten"
"Ein sehr heißes Thema und definitiv wichtig anzusprechen.
Im Alltag begegnen einem genügend Beispiele, die auf eine ungerechte Behandlung hinweisen, die oft übersehen oder als selbstverständlich gesehen werden. Es ist sehr gut auf einer sachlichen Ebene darüber zu diskutieren, was in dem Beitrag deutlich gemacht wurde.
Vermutlich stammen die verbitterten Kommentare von Leuten, die mit einer aggressiven Form von Feminismus, wie er in modernen Medien weiterverbreitet ist, zu tun. Eine große Vielzahl ist für Gleichberechtigung, doch genau diese werden häufig in den Topf mit frauenfeindlichen Ansichten geworfen.
Sehr traurig, trotzdem ist der Trend positiv."
Bechdel-Test hab ich heute als ich mir den film angesehen habe zum ersten mal gehört und geht mir seit heute morgen nicht mehr aus dem kopf. Gratuliere Arte 😄
"Ich bin so froh, dass ich schwul bin und mit Frauen nichts zu tun habe."
Das thema ist so wichtig und es nur untertitelt. ich habe eine lese rechtschreibschwäche und finde es schade.
"Leider wird ARTE immer einseitiger. Von Multiperspektivität oder gar kritischem und vernunftgeleiteten Journalismus, ist in Dokus wie dieser nicht kehr viel übrig. Hochgradig emotionalisiert, wenig bis gar nicht in kontext gesetzt und fast nur noch Meinung statt Fakten. Diese spalteriache Meinungsmache führt unweigerlich zu grosen problemen."
"Habt ihr Quellen für die Zahlen die ihr dort nennt? Oder einen Kontext? Man unterscheidet bei der Gender-Pay-Gap doch zwischen ""bereinigt"" und ""unbereinigt"" (m.M.: komische Wortwahl), zumindest nach dem Statistischen Bundesamt. Hier werden wieder Fakten verzerrt und von daher kann ich den Rest schon nicht mehr ernst nehmen."
"Erschreckend die Entwicklung. Dabei geht es nicht nur gegen Frauen, sondern auch gegen viele Minderheiten.
Hier in Deutschland hat die religiöse Rechte aus den USA und ihre Positionen seit Corona leider immer größeren Einfluss. Auch die AFD vertritt deren Positionen und die hat in  den Umfragen zur Bundestagswahl 21 Prozent.
Ich kann nur sagen gruselig"
"Ist es sexuelle Belästigung wenn sich die Frauen die Jogahposen bis in die Ritze rein stoßen und dann so herum laufen, oder der gilt das als normal?"
0:36 wie einfach der Koran hier falschherum gelesen wird 😂
ich schaue das beim Kochen und ich kann kein Französisch...! bitte übersetzt doch!!!
"Zeichen der Anziehung als sexuelle Belästigung zu bezeichnen, macht flirten unmöglich. Nach einem Korb weiter zu machen, halte ich für Belästigung. Leider ist es dafür schon zu spät, um nicht in einer Schublade zu landen also flirtet man kaum noch."
"Sehr coole Doku, danke!"
"Es ist leider soweit gekommen, dass alle Männer (meine Wenigkeit eingeschlossen) auf der Arbeit grundsätzlich schweigen, sobald eine Frau den Fahrstuhl betritt. Kein Hallo oder wie geht’s, gar nichts. Besonders wenn Mann alleine ist im Fahrstuhl. Mann will sich keinem falschen Vorwurf aussetzen, hört sich übertriebenen an, aber so ist es leider."
"Für solch ein Komplexes und vielschichtiges Thema sind leider 26min zu wenig. Man könnte über den Gender Paygap in einem Land wahrscheinlich bereits die 26min gut füllen können. Auf jeden Fall sollte man beim Gender Paygap erwähnen, dass es einen bereinigten und einen unbereinigten gibt, weil beide sehr unterschiedliche Werte ergeben. Für Deutschland wären das z.B. nach Daten des Statistischen Bundesamtes zum Gender Pay Gap 2020:
- unbereinigt: 18%
- bereinigten: 6%
Und eine Diskussion starten wie man es genau erreichen möchte, den Gap zu schliessen.
IMHO: Auf diese Weise müsste man jedes der angesprochenen Themen in dem Beitrag angehen."
Doppelmoral
Bitte beim nächsten Mal synchronisieren.
Was wären wir ohne unsere überversorgten Feministen und Feministinnen ! (Seufz)
"Wieder mal so eine richtig sexistische, diskriminierende Doku."
"Ach ja. Noch mein Lieblingssatz. 
""Mütter erzieht, und verzieht nicht, eure Söhne. Sie sind nicht ""Mamas kleiner Liebling"", nicht schon ab Kindesalter "" Mann im Haus"". übrigens grauenvoll für die Seele eines kleinen Jungen. Und nicht ""Partnerersatz"". Frauen haben es auch in der Hand, zu welchen Männern ihre Söhne werden. Das könnte das Problem eventuell wenigstens zu Teil helfen zu lösen. Selfreflektion."
Aber Hauptsache es wird fleißig gegendert!
Wieso gibt es bei so wichtigen Themen keine Syncro?
Ich als Frau kann das nicht bestätigten
Feminismus ist auch nur Spaltung
Ich kann nicht in Worte fassen wie sehr ich ARTE hasse. Ein Haufen arroganter Besseerwisser. Seid froh dass ihr “zwangsfinanziert” werdet.
Idiocracy….🥸
"Wertes Arte Team, unter meinem Post von vor einem Tag sind Antworten verschwunden und ich würde nach Möglichkeit geren wissen ob ihr das wart. danke im Vorraus..."
"Ich muss zugeben ich mag den Feminismus nicht mehr. Ich will zwar das Frauen gleiche Rechte haben, aber auch nicht mehr als das. Ich fände es sogar noch gerecht wenn Frauen eine Prämie für eine vollendete Geburt bekommen würden aber ansonsten finde ich dass Frauen zu viel Aufmerksamkeit bekommen."
Wozu me too? Wegen scheidentrockenheit?
Wenn alle einfach gendern würden gäbe es quasi keine Ungleichheit auf der Welt😂
"Schon klar, die Freiheit…
Nein Danke Arte!"
😂😂 ich kann nur noch lachen.
"Eine Gesellschaft kann einem auch den Mund verbieten da diese ihre Faselei und Bluberei als alleinige Formgebung der Materie versteht, was an sich gegen jede Gleichstellung ist da andere auch den ganzen Tag Buchstabenrätsel machen wo jedes mal andere Wort heraus kommen, welche genau so gut in den Pot passen wie all das momentane Gefasel auch.  Und wenn dann bestimmt Kreaturen aus den regierenden Kreisen noch einen vom Jobs erzählen, müssten im Grunde alle Alarmglocken läuten da wir diesen selbstverständlich im großen Buchstabenrätsel "" Werfs in Töpfchen"" für andere die Jobs erledigen könnten. Siehe den Begriff JAGUAUARS die neuen Jumper von Planeten Pumper."
Auf dem Spiel steht der sogenannte Hausverstand.

This is the definition of straw man arguments. Creating a target for your ideological rants that is not based on truth in any way. That should be one of the deadly journalistic sins.
A ukelele? Appropriating Hawaiian culture... I'm offended.
I couldn't stop laughing until I realized it isn't satire or poor sarcasm.
"This is the first time I've seen a comment page be so much better than the video itself. I'm tired today's adults (I'm a part of this generation born in the 80s) who get triggered easily, think it's ok to demonize ALL men over the sins of a minority of men, etc. etc."
"Keep up with the good work sponsoring and publishing horrible content guys, you're on the right track to self-destruction. Thank you very much"
"I'm glad she sung that song, now I know who NOT to date."
Those crazy eyes.....yikes
"Man: ""Can I say anything right?""

Woman: *Pushes him away in disgust*

That pretty much sums up the horrible woman's problems in a nice, clean nutshell."
Women used to be dignified and respected.
So tired of the demonization of men.
"Dear New York Times,
Stop hating men."
"Ugh.  ""Comedy"" has gotten so bad.  Making your actual talking points while making goofy faces and being condescending isnt what parody is.  Stop this."
"The things the men supposedly said wrong:
Guy 1 - didn’t want to talk about politics on the first date (A pretty normal thing to do). Saying that a movement possibly has gone too far despite its good intentions (a reasonable stance). Asking a girl he likes to come and watch/support something he enjoys and participates in (a very normal thing to do).
Guy 2 - tries to see a positive side to a dark outlook on life that she brought up (a healthy thing to do). Apologizes when she takes it the wrong way (a good and polite thing to do). Indicates that some men do bad things but trying to find a way to get her to trust despite that (a normal thing to do).
Guy 3 - feels uncomfortable with her dark assumption of him (very normal for a first encounter). Tries to sympathize with her and make her feel more comfortable (a very normal and good thing to do). Expresses frustration when she intentionally misconstrues his sentiment on multiple occasions (very very very very normal thing to do).

You are the problem, not whatever you think they mean."
"If this song is aimed at portraying the tenuous, wailing hysterics of the modern feminist woman; then congratulations, you've created a masterpiece. I just don't know whether to vote up or down."
"""journalism"""
"Lmao shes got them crazy eyes. This video is trying to portray men as ""toxic"" but it's having the opposite effect."
"So sad that this generation has sunken and reduced the dating culture to some form of predatory behavior men commit. 😞 sad future for women, because many men will be afraid to approach you now for fear of being accused of sexual harassment or saying the wrong thing!"
Her cats liked this video
Good one. But you brought it on yourself. :)
"What a brilliant parody of modern women. Maybe a bit too far, but still pretty clever."
Why is the #me too movement ignoring the #120db movement ?
All I want is a woman who's sane.  I guess we're both going to be disappointed.
Exhibit A for why Men will take robot women over real women.

So what you're saying then is 8 years of Trump
So let me get this straight. Pun intended. Is there nothing that this woman won't find offensive? Is this a parody or satire of liberal lunacy?
Y'all finally posted this on youtube! Now every other commentator can roast it!
Has the NYT been redpilled? Pointing out how ridiculous/hysterical some of these movements have become? Impressive.

"This is a glorious critique on the venomous double standard and obsessive disdain at the heart of modern feminism and SJW culture in general.  Bravo, and well done."
"I was really struggling with the intent behind this video. Is she a poe, is she serious, is she mocking men, is she mocking femenists? But No i just watched her standup and other videos. She’s not self aware or smart enough to be doing this on purpose. I truly believe  this is just a moment where the art really supersedes the artist. As if her hand in writing this was unknowingly guided by the most holy and lead to create pure cosmic tragicomedy. And like all of Gods creations, it fractals up and down infinitely so that there is always another layer of comedy encasing the last and always another layer of tragedy encased within the next."
I'd like a woman that hasn't had twelve men in her.

You go back to your strife.
When you're not screeching in the nude
Your crying for his money, dude

I can't think of an end to this song, because you won't end yours."
Can The New York Times smell its own death?
This is why genuine news companies shouldn’t delve into satire. It just comes out as stupid and cringey.
"The most disturbing part of this, to me, is that the NYT thinks this counts as an ""opinion.""

What was the opinion?  What was she even saying?  Who knows!  Who cares!
The New York Times, ladies and gentlemen, ""We used to be respectable."""
"I appreciate the satirical aspects put forward in the video, however it isn't much of a joke when it is a horrible reality."
"This is how people who have never had normal social interactions think normal social interactions go.
It's like watching Lifetime."
I genuinely can't tell who this should be insulting towards.
Why are people with tiny stringed instruments so awfully annoying
"This is a satire, i refuse to believe otherwise."

"I fully believe the reason I've spent my entire college career locked up in my apartment online with my friends is because:
1. I'm more introvert than extrovert
2. I'm convinced that college culture/most women will dislike me for my non-con-formative views.

I was told for my entire life that college was suppose to be a great time in my life, and there have been good times, but its mostly been me cringing at how brainwashed society has become in believing the narrative.

Its sad too. There are a lot of great guys out there that are good people, but society and the media have convinced half the population that they are evil. Most of these guys are super normal and coming from humble backgrounds. But I'm white and male so I guess playing video games, hunting, reading, writing D&D stories and grabbing a drink with my friends makes me ""privileged"" or a bad person.
Despite my parents working from paycheck to paycheck for everything we have. A voice in the back of my head tells me to wait until everyone else grows up and I'm well established in life before dating. But I'm young and I want to find someone special in my life. We want the same thing, but I'm not accusing you of crimes you haven't committed."
Wow!  I don't think I've ever cringed so hard.
My faith in humanity as portrayed by the massive dislike ratio has been restored.
I am proud of this community.
2/10 Wouldn't bang
The like to dislike ratio gives me hope for humanity <3

I absolutley salute this parody. It's an accurate example of feminist overreacting and acusing men of things they dont even have proof upon. Their movement became a parody just like this video is showing it and i think we need more videos like this to show just how ludacris it became.
Is this satire? I want to get off mr bones’s wild ride
"Call me a definitional purist all you want but this doesn’t fit the definition of satire. 

Satire is “the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues”. The only way this is satire is if she is criticizing herself for her beliefs which she clearly isn’t since she is presenting one perspective: her outlook on the world. She believes wholeheartedly in what she says and believes she sneak this by as “satire” by adding a ukulele... not so fast!"

"Why Annamalai is quiet? Is it because of wrestlers in Delhi? Why Kushboo NCW Member is silent? Why Southern Artists Artistes are quiet? How Hindu Frontline are silent? What Mr Ram has to say?
What MP Kanimozhi has to say? 
Ministry/Deptt dealing with women's welfare is silent. SC has to take suo moto action. Intellectuals in Tamil Nadu should follow up. POCSO has to include ladies also. It should be straightaway a cognizable non-bailable offence. Proof of innocence should lie on the molester, rapist.

It is known that a Rule From God for all of us is that we women must not go in a room alone with a man who is not our husband or our real father or our real son or our real brother or our blood uncle.  Are children taught this in public school in America?

"Obey God's order and be safe, even after death also."
"Trust me married women and young girls and boys are being violently attacked by their own family members.  Ladies: please take care and “When in Doubt, Check Him Out”.  Pray for safety and peace at home! Always.  I have remained unmarried because I was attacked at work at the age of 16 by a creepy sexual predator boss and also in my 20’s both at home by my drunk F boyfriend in college and at work.  

I don’t care how much money they have.  Since that, I’ve turned them all down for marriage.  I won’t tolerate drugs or alcohol in my home. Period.  End of story.  Again, ladies, protect yourselves and your children from monster’s like these. ✌️🙏💜"
Now let’s talk about women’s dress code. Does it say “f*ck me 2” or “respect me 2”?

Tarana Burke articulates the problem so clearly. Good interview.
"In tears, this childs story breaks my heart."
Well said Tarana Burke
Tarana Burke is so good ! An American hero!
"Tarana---I have long held the belief that unless and until MEN CONFRONT OTHER MEN BEHAVING BADLY---this dynamic won't really change.  When they see it, confront the man directly....don't be afraid.  STAND UP FOR WOMEN.  Only then do you deserve to feel righteous."
He’s an accomplice.....this is easy work fire his a$$!
Absolutely shocking ☹
Question: The parents of the girls never questioned why they were getting $300 for visiting some older man?
"Jennifer it is not your fault that you didn't report him.  You were groomed, manipulated, violated, assaulted. Trauma like that impacts a person on so many complex levels, including overwhelming fear and shame that is like a prison. 
It is not your fault. 
It is not your fault. 
None of this is your fault."
I will never try and convict any man based on an interview. Take me to a court and let the factual evidence decide one way or the other.

And where are  the parents where a 14 year old girl can have enough time to visit someones house without parents looking for her
"“‘You were the seal of perfection,
    full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
13 
You were in Eden,
    the garden of God;
every precious stone adorned you:
    carnelian, chrysolite and emerald,
    topaz, onyx and jasper,
    lapis lazuli, turquoise and beryl.[a]
Your settings and mountings[b] were made of gold;
    on the day you were created they were prepared.
14 
You were anointed as a guardian cherub,
    for so I ordained you.
You were on the holy mount of God;
    you walked among the fiery stones.
15 
You were blameless in your ways
    from the day you were created
    till wickedness was found in you.
16 
Through your widespread trade
    you were filled with violence,
    and you sinned.
So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God,
    and I expelled you, guardian cherub,
    from among the fiery stones.
17 
Your heart became proud
    on account of your beauty,
and you corrupted your wisdom
    because of your splendor.
So I threw you to the earth;
    I made a spectacle of you before kings.
18 
By your many sins and dishonest trade
    you have desecrated your sanctuaries.
So I made a fire come out from you,
    and it consumed you,
and I reduced you to ashes on the ground

"If you research the recruiters you’ll see that “FlyGirl” pulled all of her social media except for YouTube. I got a feeling that one of these recruiters made a deal.

Now is the time for the good guys to step up and protect these children."

Epstien should burn on the courthouse steps. But lets be honest. Aint nobody trying to take that. Aint enough whiskey in kentucky or ireland for anybody to try to push up on that.
Tarana Burke has a face only a silverback could love.
Me too was stopped because it was taking too many DEMOCRATS down. Epstein stories will get quiet when more DEMOCRATS start biting the dust.

These comments make me so happy to see so many waking up to the truth about this gynocentric society we all live in
"This woman is right. I can see this movement getting out of hand and extreme feminists hijacking it for their own narrowly defined agendas.
 Already I've seen commentors equating bosses who yell at them with sexual predators. Sexual assault is illegal - a ""mean"" boss is not."
It's too risky now for companies to hire women.
It's absolutely hilarious at my job. The women will only talk to/ flirt with the higher ups with their suit and ties. These losers start to believe these women actually like them then all of a sudden BAM! He's in trouble LOL
Bingo. That is what this is designed to accomplish. They want to drive a wedge between men and women.
"A drunk chick grabbed my junk at a bar one time , I started flipping on her and she bought me a drink .. but should file charges ?  I mean it's all the same right ?"
In a word...YES!  It's a promotion of MISANDRY...hatred of all men...and it like misogyny should be declared a crime against humanity.
"No, men are not more masculine now. Masculinity is definitely a before thing."
"If a woman accuses someone on social media, she is lying.

If she files a police report, I have a hard time doubting her"
Next thing you know thousands of gynecologists are gonna be charge for sexual assault.
What is my sin against women? Believing that they aren't all like that.
I'm so glad you had her on Tucker! Finally a voice of reason in this madness!.....A real woman ladies and gentlemen👏
"Tucker, lots of info been round for 40-50 yrs...how can you look surprised."
Yes! This is a bullshit movement!              ✌🏻
"Hollywood & Hillary need to admit who knew?  Merle Streep, Metoo. They ALL knew."
the liberal me too movement is a joke
"Oh no, not judging all men!! That means us whiteys will be  vilified too and let's just keep that to the melanated population."
"Even though I support MeToo , I do think it's unfair to the accused men, because it's just like a he said she said. There's no proof either way. And some men get wrongly prosecuted too."
MAGA ???? the answer = MGTOW !!!
"From the buzz of being an independent women a decade ago to now being an independent man. Man, times have changed"
MGTOW schools are needed.
"I never thought I would ever agree with Tucker Carlson, but this Women's movement has gone too far.  Men are being accused of domestic violence, thrown in jail and considered guilty until proven innocent.  Case woman who visited child's Father's home was told to leave, she sat on the floor (hardwood) in protest.  He picked her up and she left.  Twenty four hours later she filed DMV charge and he was arrested.  She said he slammed her to the floor.  SHE HAD NO MARKS OR INJURIES and this was in the police report.  Some women are using this tactic to get full custody of a child."
Men go fishing. They cast out an un-baited lure repeatedly just to see if anything bites. Women go fishing. They cast out un-founded accusations just to see if anything bites. For both the men and ladies it costs nothing.
She admitted that not all men are rapists? This is damage control. Holy crap
"I am a woman and have sons and feel this Women's movement is overkill.  What a childish slogan anyway, it reminds me of little girls in school who tattle on boys.   It is causing men to actually be afraid to approach a woman or talk to a woman.   That is a sad development and men should definitely have a me too movement."
"With all this shit going on, maybe shirara law might not be a bad thing"
"i took the red pill....employers will simply shut the door and not hire any woman due to the huge financial risk of a  sexual harassment charge, you might say they will sue you for discrimination charge, but they will simply pay that small fine, which will save their company, the bosses job, life etc... i am making popcorn and going to watch this ride."
Nope the past 50 yrs has.
"If you want to think about the me too movement. Think of Clarence Thomas and what he went through. One of his former employees Anita Hill accused him of sexual harassment. When he was about to be confirmed as judge of the Supreme Court, the allegations against him were intense. And he the more Anita Hill said that he did sexually harassed her, he kept on saying. “I did no such thing.”"
...casting stones!
"""Survivors March"", I love it. As a survivor of slow internet, I know their pain."
"MEN!  If you find a woman like this,.......PUT A RING ON IT.....ASAP!"
One of the few rational females.
"This is what i used to say ........... but people nowadays are getting blind in equal opportunity sort of rubbish movement. If someone is culprit, contest ur case in court . Do not run media justice in front of whole world . to me its wrong"
Women aren't saints: we all have family!
"Most people are rational and logical and there will be some questionable accusations, but being Fox News, and with your history, you should be at the forefront of this movement, unless you haven't 'cleaned house' yet, which might explain your paranoia and complete dismissiveness of the whole thing. Sending out your 'forced to wear skirts and dresses' women is helping either side of the debate."
"Blacks are TIRED of the MeToo Movement. I've been tired!! I hope they just go away... ...""FOREVER!"""
Based mom :D nice get Tucker
"Anyone else get a kick out of the ""pound me too"" slogan?"
No one can be put into a box all races are different all people are different men are different and women are different there's bad and good in every human being on the Earth!
#dueprosses file your police report so i can expose you and sue.
Me too movement is toxic I don.t support it also I.m not feminist neither
"Me/too, is garbage, as it moves unilaterally; that is women get a TOTAL free pass................that is BS !"
MGTOW 4 fucking life
"If you were ever sexually harassed and worked with 27 men who allowed it to happen for years and years until one day one single man decided to speak up! I think if the horribly demeaning advances, totally inappropriate touching, insinuendos made to you in regards to how to get a pay increase, men trying to force themselves on you, trying to speak out to upper management and getting laughed at, and so so much more. I guarantee these two idiots would feel would feel and understand why the victim feels the term ""all men"" not just the few so-called criminals become scary to a woman or vice versa. You learn to put up a guard and not trust any man. I know that there are good men out there, but typically there are a lot of men who will never speak up and allow it to happen. I'm trying to raise my boys to have more respect for females.  Some victims have it a lot worse than some of the allegations being heard.  My story wouldn't make public tv because it would be rated X.  It really can be quite horrible - trust me Every day I wish that I could put it out of my mind and move on from it. But it's just so damn hard to be forgiving, forget and moreso trusting. Haven't you had a boss or co-worker who irritated the crap out of you in so many ways? I doubt you ever forget someone along your career path 4 reasons that aren't even harmful in nature. Now magnify that times 100 plus YOU lose your job due to that's so called retaliation. You have to cover everything up for years and before you know it it's affecting your marital life as well as even raising children. That anger builds and builds to the point that we lose trust in the opposite gender fully. I apologize that I sometimes include all men but that's more of a figurative way of speaking. Very hard to understand until you've been through it yourself."
YES
so sad i cant hung  a woman no more when am rich
valentines ruined this year ? YEP
"I love Christina Hoff Sommers. 
Smartest real feminist around."
mgtow
"Nope, just the sexual predators."
"it's not an ""all men"" judgement, it's a ""those men"" uproar.  What we are seeing is an explosive women's movement against a workplace problem that has been going on for decades.  Women didn't speak up.  They didn't know how to.  They were scared to.  They were embarrassed to.  They believed it was ""just me""."
"Women are only a single large EMP event from being forced back into 1800's roles.  You cannot change intrinsic biology and the differences between the sexes.  As you move more women into the traditional male-dominated work environment, you will see natural male tendencies to procreate and have sex with as many women as possible (not al men will be able to control those urges and not all will be able to do so indefinitely in all situations).  When you change the gender roles based on feminist ideology---and mix the sexes like never before, you will have reality.  Previously, society had roles and expectations which resulted in more segregation of sexes that prevented a lot of this.  Those roles have been removed.  Perhaps women should raise children and maintain homes as that is the roles that are most suited for (not mandatory or for everyone, but the feminist notions are artificial and hurt children and society---including women). You cannot legislate away the differences in biology."
Next thing you know thousands of gynecologists are gonna be charge for sexual assault.

I’m sorry but he’s right. A lot of men are now wary of being involved with women in the workplace especially.
he told the truth and sometimes people don't wanna hear the truth
"He is absolutely right. 
I have friends with businesses that think the same way.
Why? Because women have become a financial liability for companies..."
"Probably the most positive person in th USA and they pull this shit on him. He explained himself very well in the video. Victimhood is not the answer. The shame is yours. You have dig deep to see the issues and bring yourself to overcome them but they are yours. Identifying the abuser is only a very small first step in healing. And money won't help you heal caliber - it will likely make it worse. Heal-up, get on the horse, and ride again!"
"Robbins was right, despite the apology. I'll always make sure never to be alone with a woman in an office anymore, now that I know I can have my life wrecked 20 years after on a simple allegation."
People actually blew Tony Robbin's comments/actions out of proportion - the highlights of the incident do him no justice.  He pushed the lady in the video as an example to demonstrate a point not because he was trying to enforce his will.  His comments come from a good place.
He is not wrong though
My problem with the #metoo movement is that it is sexist in nature. Both women and men can be sexually abusive.
I mean as a woman it wasn't cool what he said but it's the truth😐
His right you know
"Here we go again, if you dont agree with these people they attack you. Everyone wants to be a victim. SMH"
If you don't try to understand what's he is saying you run the risk of missing the whole scary picture
"If he was a victim, he has the right to an opinion, enough said"
It's terrible how some people can say something wrong by mistake and get so hated for it. Can't even talk anymore. What in the world are we doing to each other?
A movement that can not take light criticism is moving in the wrong direction.
He's only saying sorry because people got offended by his remarks but he was saying the truth & the truth hurts.
he is RIGHT
"I understand Tarana, but he's right.  They are both right."
"Never apologize, It'll never be good enough."
"Of course he's sorry and wants to get connected with the women of the Me Too movement. Any other response would cost him profit in his business of motivating others. He's a businessman, plain and simple. His bottom line is the almighty dollar."
How is that offensive?  Tony Robbins is a genuinely nice person. Everyone is making it so you can't say anything without offending someone. Absolutely ridiculous. He shouldn't have to apologize. He will because he's nice and never intended to hurt anyone.
"If a man is uncomfortable hiring an attractive female, he is the one with the problem, not her.  Victim blaming 101"
Tony is just saying the truth
He’s right but it doesn’t matter if you say anything that doesn’t support me2 100% that will try to ruin your career
'Me too' is malevolent.
His contribution to our world reaches far beyond what you can see in this short news clip. If you do not know who Tony Robbins is I encourage you to learn more about him before jumping to conclusions.
He’s right
good for him
"Always someone going to mess things up for someone who helps thousands of people! He's just telling the truth! This country can't handle that anymore or? Some of you woman wanted to be treated the same well here you go!!!! How about ""COMMON SENSE MOVEMENT"" or isn't there any left?"
"He’s. One. Hundred. Percent. On. Point. 

Eff metoo. It’s only hurting women and is just a ploy by women who want their five minutes of fame. Gtfo."
Why not encourage ppl to hire both men and women and encourage employers and employees to keep their hands and nasty comments to themselves and dont make false accusations so that they won't have any problems in the work place!!!! His apology comes after he realized his mouth could cost him money!!!!!!!!!!!🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
I thought the #metoo was a meme.     :/
Tony Baloney
"I heard the same thing, men are now afraid to hire women.  For the first time, since I was a young kid in the 1960's, I am starting to see all male office environments again.  Not a woman in sight.  No problems, no drama, and no lawsuits."
#himtoo stop objectifying him!
I am a woman and I find nothing wrong with empowering women not to label themselves as victims and live life as a victim
Why apologise for being against victim mentality
Let's bully him for saying the truth....
Robbins should not apologize for telling the truth .no one wants to hire women.why would you gave how week
That's why I don't get hired sometimes. Female bosses are too attracted to me ;)
Listening to his comments I don't think he was against the me-too movement I think he's against those who utilize movements like this to lie cheat and steal which cheapens the movement for those who are actually Overcomers from traumatic events.
"One time a girl ""accidentally"" touched my finger. I am a survivor 😤💪🏼"
i stand with him
He was right though. This is like apologising for the crying baby.
"Isn't what Tony Robbins is saying yet another way to shut women up?  Shame them for coming forward? Telling them if they continue they will not get job offers from male employers because ""they"" are afraid of women.  This is the same attitude I've heard for the past 50 years.  Tony you are off base."
"He is absolutely right. 
Me too bullshit mouvement made it very dangerous to hire women with all the false accusations and so on. 
Women brought this upon themselves."
"I’m not for or against tony.  It seems to me he is saying victimhood will get you nowhere (i agree with that), but then he is also saying if you fight they will just fight back (this is what the demonstration with the lady was meant to prove), so is there no point reporting anything according to Tony?  He also said ‘he without sin cast the first stone’.  Just because you’re not prefect doesn’t mean you don’t stand up for right and wrong and justice. That isn’t the meaning of ‘he without sin’.  It means don’t judge someone’s moral failure, but applies to consenting adults.  The metoo movement was about non-consensual behaviour."
The only reason Tarna (whatever the hell her name was) is because women can't have their lives ruined by false allegations
He's still alive?
"He did not say anything wrong to her, she misunderstood him"
wtf he's right abc take this L he's right
He has nothing to apologize for.
I FORGIVE HIM🙏❤️💯
Tony saved thousands of women from sex trafficking this year alone... did you mention that?
if you have to go find outrage like a heat seeking missile so you can feel better about yourself ... then you got bigger problem than abuse.
dont care love always!!  Tony rocks
"""I'm not knocking the Me Too movement. I'm knocking victimhood"". So you go to a self help seminar then complain when you're challenged for having a victim mindset? Robbins whole program is based on creating your OWN happiness. Personal accountability and I don't mean that in the sense of blaming yourself if you went through a tragic experience, but owning up to your life and the hand that's been dealt to get through that experience. You are responsible for your own happiness."
"Fu-- his excuses and apologies...he made profoundly unenlightened HARMFUL comments and as a "" non victim"" he will have to take his lumps..SUCK IT UP!!!"
I don't like this guy but he was right that Metoo is a culture of victimhood.  What hes said since has been complete bullshit aimed at not losing followers.
Be more professional sometimes you need to pick and choose your words to get your point across and someone that's been abused he should have been more selective of his words he should know better
Yuk
#YouToo Tony
Tony was right stop hating on Tony !!!!
So what was the big deal?
"I am a women and I am not part of the me too movement.  He is so right and women need to get a grip on things.  You are distancing yourself from men and other women.  First of all I would agree that you should be respected by men - that first comes from respecting yourself.  Not the say that all women are responsible for what happens to them....but it you act and dress like a slut you will be treated like one.  Yes, I have friends that have been raped.  And yes there are horrible men that take advantage of women....but come on....some of you need to take a little responsibility.   First I would say to stop idolizing the celebrities that have the demonic symbols in there concerts.  If they are controlled by demons why would you want to be like them?"
Tony is no ones fu*king GURU!
"Cannot say I disagree with what he said if one realizes being a victim isn't healthy whereas being a survivor is empowering.  Tony Robbins is in the empowering business not the pity part victim movement!   

And men as well as women get harassed and assaulted so lets stop making the #MeToo gender specific.  And unlike many people who misspeak at least Tony Robbins apologized!!"
"It's about our humanity, fellas."
Opinions expressed fail
Tony's an aggressive sob..landshark con guy
This is the problem there are so much people getting offended by something so small mostly women that just give them another reason not to hire you. You can't even listen to something without getting people offended. What makes you think you will get a job by complaining and that's why you things will stay the same because that's all women do ( not all ) I have to put that so people don't get offended anyways they complainin and wonder why they are in the same place maybe if you look at what your trying to get equality you should see what we are doing because you are busy worrying about what other people think will guess what that's the difference we don't care what you guys are doing well just get shit done. But it's getting harder not to care because you are dragging all your problems to us like it's our fault.
"Life, doesn't end when we die from this physical plane, what happens is our physical eyes eyes close, and our spirit eyes open; now, if during your physical life you believed in God and called upon the name of Jesus, when you leave this physical world your souls will go straight to Jesus, where you will enter into the kingdom of heaven to live forevermore. However, if you didn't believe in God nor call upon the name of Jesus, when those people die their spirit eyes will open into a world of condemnation, and they will be judged and will suffer the finale of spirit death; choose life! Follow no man or guru, swamis not preaching directly from the Holy Bible and following God and Jesus, also read that book yourself."
#It’soktobewhitetoo
True 😢
Who in their right mind would pay and listen to a person telling them nothing?
"The deciding factor is not whether or not to hire an attractive woman!  You hire the person most qualified and if it's the woman,  make sure your male employees know how wrong sexual harrassment is! Make sure they know the repercussions of making any woman uncomfortable! Make sure the males know that sexual harrassment/assault/misconduct will not be tolerated whatsoever!! What the heck is this childish behavior about it's better to not hire women at all?!  GTFOH thats a damn sorry excuse for not wanting to do the right thing!"
He's a fake! He bullied that girl. A sham.

double the sentence of false accusers
"Absolutely agree with him.
If a woman makes false accusations, She should immediately be sentenced the same amount of jail time the man would get if convicted"
Took him years and tens of millions.
And thats the real problem. The fact that women rarely(if ever) are punished for false accusations against a man.
"My husband went through this. Unfortunately, we don't have Johnny Depp money, so he had to take a deal rather than get the not guilty verdict"
It's funny how heard claim Johnny beat her but the next day there was no bruising or swelling. Other ladies that were beat up had body and face swelling and bruises everywhere. No makeup can really cover it up. Heard had flawless makeup

It's sickening to accuse someone of rape and abuse
I 100% agree with myron here protect your seed yall avoid this as much as possible its not worth it the risks outways the benefits it happened to 2pac as well
That's true . Tha happened too to such a celebrity. Just imagine regular men.
I have a rule.  If a woman accuses a man of something i listen but don't believe.  If the guy is rich or dated the girl and moved on I immediately side with the guy.
"Sadly due to corrupted women abusing their privileges.  A lot of innocent men are in jail. Even if they prove their innocence, their lives are still forever destroyed."
"This dude is 100% right I absolutely agree with him women that do this type of shit they need to be held accountable and I’m a woman saying that, so what does it say about me?"
Shout to all my exes for never shitting on my bed🤙
"She's evil, not crazy."
Shitting on beds and stuff 😂
Shit the bed and tried to blame it on the dog
Don't forget this also had butterfly effects. Completely destroyed the Fantadtic Beast franchise.
She should’ve been in prison for life
If it can be proved in the same court that the accuser lied they should get similar punishment that the original defendant would have been facing
Jail all false accusers.
I agree 1000%!  Yes protect women if there found guilty. But if caught lying or slandering? Whatever time that man would have got. The false accuser should do.

The girl lied, nothing came of it cause the grape kit safe me but my name was never cleared. Now I don’t trust. I was this close to going to prison. 💔"
"I think you’re all being too harsh on her, don’t forget her dog stepped on a bee! 😂"
"Take note men. Record EVERYTHING. You never know when you will have to use it in the court of law. Every time you feel ""Man, that's not right."" Record it. And don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. These women out here don't care about you bro. And they will destroy you financially out of spite and then rinse and repeat with the next guy."
He brought up the herd turd right out the gate😂😂😂
"Yeah I’m a victim of false accusations it’s sickening, what that woman put me and the rest of my family through"
"In the middle of actively trying to destroy Johnny Depp's life because she is petty, Amber Heard got a modeling contract."
"Next time you watch pirates of the Caribbean, remember the entire series was ended by one dump"
I watched the entire trial (or at least part of it that was allowed on camera) that crap was crazy
"Yes indeed, glad someone has spoken on this. Why is it that the person that cries wolf doesn't get in trouble when they lie. I had the same thing happen after it was investigated they found out she was lying and nothing was done after. I didn't go through the same thing with court and everything but I had to speak to the detectives a few times and then come in a third time to get the information about what happened."
Never fails women's like always...smh just too proof he was guilty smh
"A woman can write your name on a birth certificate and in most states, even if the baby is not yours, you have to pay or they will go to jail."
"I thought he recorded in his own home? 
Not illegal"
But the feminists won’t talk about it🤦🏿‍♂️
"I agree, we need to punish those who get proven to have lied about their accusations. Not a matter of “believe all women”, it’s a matter of ensure no lying."
"We really need to penalize
Women who are physical emotional verbal mental 
Abusers for not only
Monetary benefit or gain but for everything else that they're abusive for & wanting
To Control & they Lie!!

I thought falsified police report was a crime in of itself!
Its not illegal to record conversations as long as one party knows.
"I am a woman, I was graped when I was 12 and for me it is abhorrent to cry wolf about something so serious... real victims or survivors are often not beleived because of theese dispicable frauds 😮😮😮"
false accusation should hold the same charge as the accusation
"At the very least, a false accuser should receive the same sentence the accused would have gotten."
He didn't lose the purses of the  carribean he turned the role
Don't forget he already got found guilty and one court of Law and had to go through the whole thing again
That was crazy work.... shout out to Johnny d
"Yall see the video of amber on the stand railing a line of blow? 🤣 it’s apparent she lied about everything, ended up needing the grace of the Yayo just to last"
"She was penalized, she lost the court and was ordered to pay $15 Mil"
Most of us don’t have the money or resources to prove our innocence
He ain't lying there
100% true. Men need legal protective n from women's false accusations.
She should be in jail
"I have audio of a woman literally hurting me, three days after 4 level neck fusion. Laid up in a bed... couldn't even go downstairs. Police arrested me, saying, I instigated it by, and I quote... ""Not doing as she asked and going to wash the car."" Literally, three days after being released from 4 level, neck fusion with cadaver bone.

State of Idaho. CDA. Judge Peterson. Convicted me, I spent my 30 days after fusion, in a cell. Neck fusion. Needed help to even wash my body, wasn't able to shower for a month. Didn't get to see my real doctor's. KMC medical center even said I didnt have surgery... the fired the doctor who did the surgery, she now works in WA state."
Send these woman who make false accusations to El Salvador for the rest of their life.
🦆 the british courts that sentenced him guilty
I just got done with a 3 year battle because of that.
So Johnny Depp is the Spokesperson for what Black men have gone through for decades.
This is why I don’t want to be in a relationship
And she never lost her role in Aquaman 2
"Yup.  Some. People just want money 

💲💲💲💲💲💰💰💰💰💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💰💰💰💰💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💲💲💲💲💲"
"100. She needed punished. She perpetuated evil.
😢
She went free"
This is so important!
The process is the punishment
Bro looks stressed out. The life he lives has caught up to him. Was it worth it? Nothing he did changed anything. 304s are 304s and simps are simps.
Any average normal regular guy who went through with Johnny Depp went through with Amber Heard would have had their life destroyed because they don't have his resources.
You can use most divorce and custody cases to prove your point.
That last part needs to be true
"even teenage girls (rarely, i admit) do this too. can't remember the details, but there was this young black man who got his future and scholarships taken from him because she falsely accused him... and she didn't even feel bad about it."
#MeLieToo
"My baby Mama was abusive both verbally and emotionally to me to the point where I had to leave her and then after I left her went to the courts and claimed all this stuff like im stalking and drugging and drinking and  when I haven't even seen her or my kids in  over a year... So I take her to court and the judge just eats up everything she says Without even checking anything like taking a second to like Ask me Anything she just sentenced me to having to do a bunch of hoops to jump through and gave her the  temp restraining order she was asking for when there was no contact at all just to keep me from my kids to punish meverbally and emotionally to me to the point where I had to leave her and then after I left her went to the courts and claimed all this stuff like im stalking and drugging and drinking and  when I haven't even seen her or my kids in  over a year... So I take her to court and the judge just eats up everything she says Without even checking anything like taking a second to like Ask me Anything she just sentenced me to having to do a bunch of hoops to jump through and gave her the  temp restraining order she was asking for when there was no contact at all just to keep me from my kids to ""punish"" me."
"To deter this type of crime— give three times the penalty for false accusations/ allegations!!

Rape of woman = 10 years prison.
False rape allegations = 30 years.

I GUARANTEE you the false accusations would go way down."
"False accusations can destroy marriages, careers and lives. Not only that but also i believe it's very disrespectful towards real victims who previously or currently have to deal with real domestic abuse. It diminish the struggle."
The courts should just have you in a neutral ground until they find out what was true and or false before stamping the person as guilty or innocent.
We've created a monster
we can't punish people for falsely accusing women of being witches cause then they won't come forward for the real witches
When men finally wake up and realize that woman are mo longer these innocent frebble soft humsns.  The world will be better off
We went from not listening to women....to believing everything...human nature over compensaing
"To add on, the public, even the women, believed Depp because he's a movie star. If it's another average guy, none of those broads will care, and will still think he's the abuser. Women decides if you're right or wrong based on things like your money, status and how they FEEL about you. They don't ever make rational decisions"
"Yup, the W always get a free ticket!!! Geez!"
"I genuinely believe that if a woman lies about sa and its proven that she lied, she should serve the time the guy would've served if he was proven guilty.. anything beneath that punishment is insane."
Johnny deep was definitely innocent smh
And there are still females who believe Johnny is guilty of Amber's  allegations.
"Thanks ladies, you told men to not ever believe you or take any of you serious. Us men risk jail for even taking any of you seriously. And i never heard of one woman that ever called this out. To this day. Hence why ill never never trust women. Thanks ladies, you ruined it for the the rest of them. Ladies, start at calling the rest of them out and denouncing them atleast"
Key correcton... the recordings were not illegal... they were prescribed by their couples therapist as part of their counseling.
Don’t know any women to be raped but I know multiple guys who were falsely accused and luckily had receipts as well
Straight facts
Been in that situation
If a person cry wolf. Life in prison.
Facts
"There are consequences for your actions, and women should not be immune"
Exactly
don't forget about the harry potter spinoff movies he was a part of but got taken out of because of it.
"Why don't we ever hear about defamation lawsuits against women who try to ruin men?  You mess with me like that, i'm getting a judgement of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS! can't pay? Get out there on the streets and do what you do. always room for one more on Bissonnett. 😂"
Just facts
100% agree
FACTS
So true...
Her dog stepped on a bee. To hall with Depp
"This has become a joke
Every other person is accusing a man of harassment without providing absolutely no evidence for the courts to decide
I do sympathise with a victim, if it is genuine
Otherwise this is a method of blatant attention seeking"

Misuse of me too movement by this propaganda channel which is the devil's advocate 😈
What a shameless Journalist.  Why he is quite now. He was asking others like Big B to speak up for Tanushree. Now himself is quite on his own case. Bloody Hypocrite.
50 dislikes? someone is unhappy with allegations.
"This has become fashionable these days to put allegations against anyone.  If it is true, let her file a report with the police rather than blowing up in the media for publicity.  It appears the BJP media machinery is working to tarnish anyone questioning their policies."
Vinod dua Khane ke baad Ye sab 😂😂😂
before putting allegations on anyone have a look at yourself in front of mirror.... Nishta jain...
"The wire ne tanushree ko support kiya tha nana ko nahi dekhe hai ab kya karte hai....

Aaj dukh hua mujhe sach
"What is that he said? He predates how? 

WTF woman!!!!

MeToo is now like he didn't open the door for me 40 years ago and I feel still screwed up.

MeToo is a serious movement in which people who actually have committed the crimes against women in the expletive are named."

The only thing I must admit is he did not deny his allegations gracefully! A supporter of #Metoo calls allegations against him as ""keechad"". 

Well, the wire has an article saying ""Film maker accuses Vinod Dua of sexual harassment"". The Wire is not in agreement with Mr. Dua on this stand."
"Used to watch his jan gan man ki baat till date..  Hope this is isn't true.. guess bjp is trying to hide something very grave behind this me too campaign.. do u really care for the problems of women in other words, is me too another jumla where the accused will be saved of  consequences .. as usual??!!"

One question. What do you want to do about it beside whine?
"With little notice, President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order that advocates say rolls back hard-fought victories for women in the workplace. Tuesday's ""Equal Pay Day"" — which highlights the wage disparity between men and women — is the perfect time to draw more attention to the president's action, activists say. On March 27, Trump revoked the 2014 Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order then-President Barack Obama put in place to ensure that companies with federal contracts comply with 14 labor and civil rights laws. The Fair Pay order was put in place after a 2010 Government Accountability Office investigation showed that companies with rampant violations were being awarded millions in federal contracts. In an attempt to keep the worst violators from receiving taxpayer dollars, the Fair Pay order included two rules that impacted women workers: paycheck transparency and a ban on forced arbitration clauses for sexual harassment, sexual assault or discrimination claims. Noreen Farrell, director of the anti-sex discrimination law firm Equal Rights Advocates, said Trump went ""on the attack against workers and taxpayers."" ""We have an executive order that essentially forces women to pay to keep companies in business that discrimination against them, with their own tax dollars,"" said Farrell. ""It's an outrage."" Out of the 50 worst wage theft violators that GAO examined between 2005-2009, 60 percent had been awarded federal contracts after being penalized by the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division. Similar violation rates were tracked through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Labor Relations Board. Now isn't that order very consistent with the sexual criminal confessions we all heard not once. but on two separate occasions during the Axis Hollywood bus. previous to that during his interview with Howard Stern. Former prosecutor Gov. FBI director Giuliani. Said those audiotaped criminal confessions were nothing more than locker room talk. Not according to criminal psychologist brain specialist those audiotaped criminal confessions were much more consistent with a jailhouse confession from one inmate to another. Or a prison reminiscence from one convict to another who are living out there sentencing in protective custody, for sexual crimes are classified as the weakest form of criminal conduct. Not to mention any other prosecutor in the country would take two audiotaped criminal confessions as enough evidence to prosecute. And then when you have 14 witnesses come forward and validate everything that was on those audiotaped criminal confessions.Would be enough evidence to convince any judge of a conviction. Well any judge except for that desperate week insecure impulsive poor specimen of a female judge that goes on and on about how great it is being a submissive trumpet blower. And you wonder why America has the highest violent crime rate in the world. You wonder why America has the highest drug addiction alcohol dependency in the world. And you wonder why America has the most overfed undernourished people in existence. is not all gloom and doom. We can deal with this situation. As a people as physically fit mentally sound and spiritually balanced Americans. At the same time we are dealing with the situation in life. Subconsciously spiritually there souls and spirits are being implemented with, all the pain suffering disease sickness illness torment and hunger that has been allowed to occur over the years manifesting into what it is today. Thanks to incompetent lazy ignorant reckless negligent vindictive criminal leaders supporters employees employers. And now going to get far worse if Donald Trump his submissive trumpet blowers desperately impulsive employees have their way. Now let us thank our heavenly father for allowing Ronald Reagan Donald Trump supporters followers employees like-minded people for subconsciously: coherently apparently volunteering their soul and spirit to function similar to an air purifier water filtration system steam cleaner rubber gloves sponge shield bedpan urinal ass wipes blowup doll. But plug tampon maxi pad diaper jump rope ankle weights wrist weights weighted vest punching bag so forth and so on. Etc. etc. and that is the short list of how their souls and spirits are being treated. Before we get into how their souls and spirits are going to be implemented with all the pain suffering disease sickness illness torment and hunger that has occurred over the years manifesting into what it is today. Keep in mind my submissive trumpet blowers the soul and spirit can endour one up to  billions of years worth of pain suffering disease sickness illness torment and hunger .that is just a sample Of the miraculous power of spirituality eternal authority that exist beyond your comprehension for your life cannot commonly comprehend things past your life's expectancy. Now I wish and pray for my soul and spirit to be held spiritually accountable to the statements I proclaim. I guarantee you will never hear another body leader person of legal authority ever validate the statements they proclaim with that level of certainty. If the sun the father the Holy Spirit God the devil Lord Jesus or anyone else with true eternal power and authority over life and death. Felt differently about the statements on proclaiming the had four separate opportunities to keep me dead and silent. The bottom line is you're either part of the problem are part of the solution when it comes to equality between a man and a woman as well as respecting another persons physical freedom. See a dominant gentleman knows how to intelligently persuade passionately convincing a woman to have the desire to willingly want to share themselves romantically. your part of the problem are solution. Either way your being held spiritually accountable. One way comes with a pleasant form of rehabilitation physically mentally spiritually. And the other way is the opposite of the first way. Again I wish and pray for my soul and spirit to be held spiritually accountable to the statements I proclaim. I guarantee you will never hear another body leader person of legal authority ever validate the statements they proclaim with that level of certainty. One reason they don't know themselves therefore they have NO respect for themselves and can't respect others. Secondly is because they are not willing to hold themselves accountable to the way they live their life to the laws the put in place. For the laws they put in place will greatly influence whether you live and die Feeling accomplished being at peace. The bottom line is Donald Trump has been clinically diagnosed by criminal psychologist brain specialist! Leading physicians As being physically and mentally submissive! To fill that massive void a weakness) His plan to stay on the top! Is by keeping the bottom sick week desperate hungry and malnourished and poor by recirculating dirty low-paying jobs that come from outdated power sources inferior materials and toxic substances. That have lived out there usefulness for they have been classified scientifically as petrified death! More commonly known as coal oil and gas dirtiest of all sand oil. Along with other toxic chemicals that never changed their killing composition. You cannot promote life by using a substance that diminishes the quality of our air water food and landscapes. Dirty low-paying jobs very few at that however will have a negative effect on hundreds of millions for only God knows how many generations dirty low-paying jobs that diminish the quality of our air water food and landscapes with the potential of causing environmental collapse there is no profit to be made in the demise of the planet businessman my ass! Just look at the BP oil spill. The man-made water crisis situation in Flint Michigan. The man-made water crisis situation at the military base known as Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The fly ash spill that occurred from Duke Power in North Carolina. Those are a few examples. . . Of the irreversible damage that comes from working with outdated power sources inferior materials toxic substances. That have been scientifically classified spiritually validated as being physically mentally useless therefore have no true value spiritually. Now a dominant gentleman or lady that knows how to demonstrate high-class sophistication which is femininity at its finest!! for it is raw wild naturally hard-core organically appealing truly captivating absolutely eternally spiritually sought after by the gods and goddesses of the ancient royalty, warrior elite...... knows the best way to stay on the top is by keeping the bottom confidently rising in the most efficient way that is humanly possible, allowing each generation to become stronger smarter healthier happier financially better off. For that possibility of a reality to come full circle. The people must have clean high-paying jobs that used new technology. Allowing the people to fully utilize on advanced self sustainable renewable power sources. New Age top notch materials resources, that you could use this much is you would like or need without leaving any excess toxic waste behind.  equally as amazing our products can be) Manufactured  mass-produced in state of the art facility's I am talking about clean high-paying jobs from coast-to-coast globally. That improve the quality of life by enhancing maintaining the quality of our air water food and landscapes! Products Imports exports personally professionally To the highest degree of standards. Clean high-paying jobs that will be available every day of the week every week of the month every month of the year.

"If these women wanted a form of support.. they could just make videos with achievements and actions and happy music at how a support could help them, instead of another ""victimized"" video."
"The disgusting insensitive comments just proves their point that people like y’all in the comments couldn’t care less about them and their experience, I swear these comments are sickening"
"Women in USA and India suffer in silence when it comes to rape due to their male-dominated societies. But occasionally some rapes do make it to the headlines, creating much anger and disbelief. Other than that, it's business as usual, back to more sufferings in silence"
Harvey hmmmm
He is innocent !!!
He called her honey because he's a bee.
"Seinfed is awesome: ""Men and women chase after each other, right? .....RIGHT?!?!""."
She wanted to set him up but Jerry is not a fool.
He dated a 17 year old when he was in his 40's. He's never seen anything creepy happen.
“Right. RIGHT.” Well said Jerry.
"I like how she tried to make a deal out of him calling her “honey”, and he was essentially like, “ yeah, we’re not doing that.” She was wise to let it go. 😂"
She is trying so very hard to bait him into saying something he'll regret. He sees the game and calls her on it repeatedly. What's impressive is that he does it in a way that simultaneously indicates that he won't be pushed around but at the same time doesn't come off as defensive or petty. He doesn't rise to her provocation. That's tough to do on your feet.
Jerry is very good at isolating a question and answering it directly and not being suckered into a debate. He’s funny and a good listener and a very talented comedian.  Glad I grew up around his show.
"That second ""RIGHT???"" was a thing of beauty 😂😂😂"
"""honey"" is equivalent to ""bless your heart"""
That was a premature honey. Now he's got to go calling everyone honey so it looks like he's just a guy who says honey a lot.
jerry dated a high school girl when he was 38 but he's never seen comedians being creeps. look in the mirror honey
"Jerry's smarter than I thought. I always thought he was an average comedian, but he was great at not being baited and trapped with the ""right?"""
"""Men and women chase after each other ,right?.....RIGHT?!""  Jerry's no fool, he sees what shes about"
"He's 100% right.  This is in every industry,  in every part of life. Its in the film Industry, its in education, its in coaching, its in the financial world, its in the arts, its in health care........its a humanity problem not one specific industry."
Of course the man who dated a teenager in his 30's doesn't think Weinstein did anything wrong lmfao
"00:55  i love how he forces her to admit the obvious instead of just asking the questions and putting all the liability on him.  that's gold, jerry... 'ts gold!!!"
“Honey” is Jewish for “well bless your heart” 😂😂😂
"Seinfeld is saying that the ""honey"" thing is an idiom for ""you're being naive"" about this being about the industry, it is everywhere."
He’s like “don’t ask me about my 17 year old girlfriend”
"I loved the way he leaned in and asked her ""right??"" As if she could deny it somehow...😉😂😅😂😅"
"My God, how much I loved that second ""RIGHT?"". She wasn't going to concede anything, not even that men and women could voluntarily have sex with each other."
She tried to paint him into a corner and Jerry was having none of it. Good for him.
The casting couch started in the film industry and became synonymous with it. You can say it happens everywhere but that doesnt get the industry off the hook as Jerry thinks.
"That wasn’t an accident by Seinfeld, he knew exactly what he was doing, that was a professional “fuck you”."
"She was all like, “Who does this guy think he is?!”

And he was all like, “...I’m Keith Hernandez.”"
"Interviewer after: ""Can I get a hug?""
Jerry: ""No thanks..""
Interviewer: ""A little one?""
Jerry: ""..mm. no.."""
Funny how Louis C.K. overcame the controversy and owns it in his shows now.
I like that he managed to make her laugh while talking about such a serious thing. Navigating sensitive topics isn’t even what he’s known for but he handled this well.
"That ""RIGHT!?"" was such a power move."
Jerry will never be uncomfortable against anyone ever...
I love how Jerry speaks his mind and tells it like it is. I appreciate him for putting it out there with no fear!
i love how he turns the interview into the start of a seinfeld episode
"I love Jerry's interviews, he doesn't play the game..."
"As a woman I can say it’s true, this happens in every club, in work places, in the street, wherever, it’s not the show business, it’s everywhere"
"Everyone's talking about the ""honey"" interaction but low-key that's the most intelligent thing I've heard about the me too movement. It's not new, it's not confined to the ""industry"", it's about the global difference between the sexes."
"What is difficult in these scenarios is straying the coversation from being hostile, while still conveying your point. Given the context, those were some fantastic social skills."
Seinfeld has absolute contempt for nonsense and I love that.
I will always remember Jerry Seinfeld for dating an underage teenager when he was more than twice her age.
"""RIGHT?!"" - the best part. He didn't let her get away to try to fabricate her own reality in front of gullible viewers but instead actually making her acknowledge the reality as it is most time when men and woman are together in situations like that - which is is frivolous, before moving on with the topic. Excellent"
"""You cannot not be funny.""
""Of course I can! Am I being funny now?""
""A little.""
Even here."
"""Men and women chase after each other, right?"" 
* blank stare *
""RIGHT???""
Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!"
I like how he dealt with her. Respectful yet didn’t take any of her shit
"""It's not even a good story.""
Summed up perfectly with one line."
"“Men and women chase eachother, right?”
[She refuses to answer]
“Right?!”"
I’m so happy to hear common sense come from my one of my favorite comedians ❤
Don’t try an bait a comedian.  They make a living talking and being quick witted. They will go on the offense. It’s what they do
I remember when calling someone honey was a nice thing. It’s not like he was flirting. The lunch lady calls me honey and it’s very sweet
Bravo for refusing to be defensive or to follow a bs narrative.
“Did you see any of it” Guy dated a 17 year old when he was 38. He’s part of the problem 😂
"I think, the word "" honey"" was used sarcastically and she deserved the sarcasm."
"“It’s not the industry, honey”

I like how he slipped a Bee Movie reference in there"
"Seinfeld himself, like the show that bears his name, is brilliant. Even pausing to get the interviewer to acknowledge that yes, through time immemorial, men and women chase each other. He doesn’t give anyone a pass, but places it within the context of his observable reality only. Brilliant."
Oh he definitely knew what was going on 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
Jerry has added so much laughter to my life and he continues to do so everytime he opens his mouth. Love you Jerry.
"Jerry is smart, no B.S., and clearly a step ahead of the interviewer. This is why he's a major force in the business."
I remember Larry David in Curb telling Richard lewis: You just gave a premature honey 😅
"Jerry Seinfeld dated a 17 year old when he himself was 38. So I can't help but feel like he's an unreliable narrator. Also, isn't it true that sexual misconduct is very common in the entertainment industry, when compared to other fields? I could be wrong about that, but it is something I have heard and it seems like the case when you keep hearing about these things."
"Dude who dated a kid as a 38 year old man and said that she was actually on the old side while confronted about it on TV claims he never saw anything.
Sure."
"""Honey"" is a very show biz way of saying, ""Get over yourself Lady"""
The way she tries to make Seinfeld look stupid by creating awkward silence at specific moments in the conversation is absolutely dishonest.
Says the guy who dated a 17 year-old when he was 38. 🙄
"We all know who set up this question...
NEWMAN!"
Interviewer a minute in: “Shit...this guy’s way smarter than me.”
"""You gotta get with this, this isnt showbiz ""

Dude wasn't messing!"
This man dated a 17 year old when he was 38 and has the gall to criticize Hollywood morality.
"""What's the deal with HARASSMEENT?!?! Can't you just ask her out"" - Jerry Seinfeld, the method comedian"
Jesus Christ he took control of the the whole conversation with a woman using his aggressive voice and it actually worked!
Jerry took control of that interview like the pro that he is. How to call someone “honey” and not be apologetic. Never really enjoyed his work but this was 2 mins of must watch. She thought she had him but he squashed that in 2 seconds flat.
Would she ask the same question if Jerry was a woman? Nope. She'd rather not acknowledge that women in powerful positions knew about it and did nothing.
The man is too smart and secure to fall for lazy interview tricks.
"My mom has called every waitress/waiter honey for 40+ years , I never thought for a moment she was saying anything inappropriate AND I STILL DON'T."
"its not the industry, Honey. 

                         -30 yo man who married a 15 yo child"
"He's 100% right - every time there's an incident the narrative is ""X industry/institution has a sexual harassment issue"". No. There's nothing peculiar about that industry. Any place where rich, powerful and influential men are working with women, you have the same issue, whether its the armed services, academia, entertainment, business, law, government, religion or the local library. And it's not a cultural thing either. The same thing happens everywhere around the world and throughout history. But the media can't make hay around something that's been happening since the beginning of time. They have to insist that that particular industry has an issue."
"I'm 64 years old, living my entire life literally 10,000 miles away from Hollywood. At the age of 12, I knew what the casting couch was. How did these women not know? It's not victim blaming. It's asking why did they walk into the room knowing the animal was dangerous?"
Jerry has nothing to lose and can be completely honest. It’s refreshing.
"“You just called me honey…”
“I’m sorry, it must have been very painful for you darlin”"
"She's so used to just being able to say ""You just called me 'honey'"" and get the guy to crawl up in a fetal position and say he's sorry, that when he just responds with ""yep"" she has absolutely nothing."
How anyone thought Seinfeld was not annoying is beyond me
seinfeld sounds more and more like an older jewish man with every year that passes
I’ve always appreciated Jerry as a human and a comedian. 💪🏻 true brilliant man ❤️
Such a killer response from this question when she wasn’t actually asking the question for his answer.
i miss louis c.k. guy has a talent to be funny
She made a fool out herself and Jerry was very kind about it
The fact he stayed chill when she tried to call him out on being “wrong” for saying honey...chill as an ice cube
Ricky Gervais summed it up perfectly at Golden Globes.
"Love how he countered her disapproving  silence with ""right""!
Brilliant!"
Reminder that a 38 year old Jerry Seinfeld dated a 17 year old until she was 21. I’m not gonna take some creep’s opinion on another creep
"""What's wrong with your industry?"" ...As if she's not part of the media. Half the MeToo allegations came from women in the news business (against Matt Lauer, Mark Halperin, Charlie Rose, Roger Ailes, Bill O'Reilly). Seinfeld should've asked her if SHE'S seen something, and why didn't she do anything about it?"
Seinfeld dated a 17 year old high schooler when he was 38.
"""I haven't seen any sexual misconduct."" Meanwhile Seinfeld dated a 17 year old when he was about 38. Why does every single comment here defend and or praise him? This is coming from someone who grew up watching Seinfeld, that show is part of my earliest memories, a time upon which I look fondly. But that won't keep me from seeing Jerry Seinfeld for who he is."
"I love how he turns this into a bit… “What is it to SHOWER for somebody? I don’t even understand it. Who wants to watch somebody shower? …” 1:55
Hilarious 😆
She even laughed… good comedians can do that… laughing at the absurdity of some situation, in spite of how one feels about it."
"her: ""you just called me honey""
Seinfeld: ""yeah, were you not here two seconds ago?"""
"FYI, Jerry Seinfeld dated a 17-year-old when he was 38.  Her name was Shoshanna Lonstein and he met her in a park.  Totally normal shit, right?"
He literally broke her down to his level of logic and reasoning before she could get to her cancelling gotcha questions
I love the way he made her answer 👍 her playing dumb.
Jerry Seinfeld refuses to let the the interviewer put words in his mouth and I think that's great the way he controls the narrative.
Jerry Seinfeld dated a 17yo when he was in his 40s. He’s acting defensive bc he’s afraid
always funny for the guy who dated a high schooler in his late 30s to try to be the morality police
"""You just call me honey""
I'm sure there were plenty of other words he wanted to say, but Jerry is a class act."
Sick SHIT
"I am not trying to downplay sexual-harassment but it’s amazing to me how fast Congress and get behind something like this, but drags their  feet when it comes to police brutality and reform. I guess it has something to do with the group of people it affects the most........."
Everybody will say they were harassed.its going to become a trend
Babylon is falling
These people are nasty needs to be removed!!! FRIED.
"Money, + Power, + Position, +, Man, +, Woman equal sexual temptation."
*I bet yall wont say shit about B.Clinton or Anthony Weiner!!!*
The ‘Lee Millers’ of the world have always existed. The milieu has changed and that’s what’s happening. Let’s not be tainted by movements and let it happen naturally by recognizing it for what valor. Would love to see more stories like Jane Addams come to the silver scene.
Men it would seem (by our nature perhaps) simply are unaware of their partner in a way that women are aware of the other person in the relationship. We are real to each other in different ways but equally respected
D’accord ok et du coup on fais quoi ?

"People just project their own feelings onto others. I'd have no problem voting for a woman, trans person, physically disabled person ECT. I care about your policies not how you look."
"Lol, David's follow up questions are the best, and most callers blank out and just can't answer"
"I love how this guy totally crumples when simply asked to back up his claim.  David was really if anything a little too gentle with his pushback, and the guy couldn't even handle that.  I hope he reconsiders his position."
"If he didn’t want David to say a word, he should have left a voicemail, and then he’d not have been challenged. It seems that that’s how he’d prefer to be treated. Just a tip for “total control,” for the next narrative he’s “crafting.”"
What even was that? The guy didn't have any examples of his claims. It just seemed like he had a problem with the me too movement and needed to vent about that and used the excuse of women candidates not doing well in the polls to do so.
Sounds like someone doesn't like the idea of women being able to tell on their abusers and those abusers having to face consequences. He wants TOTAL CONTROL over the narative.
The guy thinks successful men should get away with abusing women..
David was asking for the literal name of someone who was unjustly affected by the me too movement while the caller thought he was asking for an example of an aspect of the movement that he disagrees with. This guy had to be kind of drunk to misunderstand a direct question so clear and simple.
Lol he’s just mad cause he got called out for harassing some girl
This totally guy seems like a manipulative creep
"Wait - - the caller thinks David ""isn't happy"" with ""the narrative"" that the caller ""crafted""? 

I don't know how anybody could be happy with whatever that bizarre narrative was, and which the caller himself was clearly not able to explain..."
Total control has some serious mommy problems.
totalcontrol871 sounds like he resents not having it any longer
Total Control does not like being questioned on his view.
"An beautiful advise to caller: “I’ve been hearing a lot of bad shit, frankly, and in many cases it’s like, wow, I’ve known some of these women and I’ve known stories like this for years and they said nothing to me. What is wrong with me? What have I, how have I presented myself in such a way as to not give confidence, or why was I not the sort of person people would see as a natural ally here? So I started looking at that.” Anthony Bourdain."
"Speaking as a woman, my (guess) at what ""Total"" was trying to say, is that this movement, as with anything else, should be taken on a case-by-case basis.  Many of these things have happened to many girls and women.  Also, and unfortunately, there are some women who were (not) victimized,  who will lie, and get money and/or revenge on exes, etc.  Sadly, those women only complicate things for true victims of all manners of harassment.

I could be wrong about the caller's point, however.

Let's not blame victims for speaking up!  Many victims have (rightfully) been afraid of retaliation.  

I'm glad the silence is broken."
"Wtf is this dude trying to say? I need a word salad translator, please?"
"Homeboy is 1000% in the comments here. Just know whatever point you thought you had , you didn't make it."
"I think it's hilarious that he actually really believes woman have enough power to ever feel ""power drunk"". Now or in the past. Wow"
"""A man’s character is most evident by how he treats those who are not in a position either to retaliate or reciprocate."" - Paul Eldridge, 1948"

"The caller is 100% right. The problem with the callerwas not having an example of this power when in reality there are dozens of them. 

Here's few. Gian Gomeshi, Vic Mignona(formerly of Funimation) Cuba Gooding Jr. and many more men have had to go through a lot of nonsense based off of FALSE allegations. Caller should've came in more prepared."
I can't wait for Al Franken to come back and for Harvey Weinstein to go away LOL
Quite ironic that his name was 'total control.' I was laughing way before David Pakman. I think this guy really thought he was giving a real example. 😂😂😂
I'd say Chris Hardwick was the victim of a crazed ex gf using me too as a weapon.
I think regular people have largely forgotten the Me Too movement.
"I loved how you asked for an example and he just went totally speechless bahaha

He DIDNT have any examples, he just feels threatened"
"I can name two instances where ""me too"" seemed (from an outside perspective) to ensnare two men where the repercussions seemed to far outweigh the allegation of misconduct: Senator Al Franken and Garrison Keeler from Lake Wobegon program.  In my mind they both seem to unfairly maligned and caught up in the fervor of a cultural moment. I think Garrison Keillor had his hand on a woman's back during a photograph, and from my outside perspective, Al Franken's photographic prank was when he was a comedian many years earlier and did not warrant his resignation from the Senate in which he was highly regarded by all of his female staff (according to accounts). But, me too represents a cultural shift and anytime there is a cultural shift, there's going to be some backlash. And it is that backlash which may be hurting some high profile female politicians as a result in the short-term."
"How does someone call in like that and make a blanket statement they can’t defend. Al Franken, Louis CK. There are examples where “me too” crucified people for simply bad behavior"
"The caller is the equivalent of an ""I'm not racist but......"" person. Perfect example of a rise in equity turning some men off."
That dude has control and anger issues coming out the wazoo.
"Women need to believe that they do not deserve harrassment and abuse. For too long we have brushed our feelings and fear aside because we felt we had to. We still face an uphill battle in many areas. I work a Management position. I am expected to dress the same as my Male counterparts but also do my hair and wear makeup. I have to literally dress like a Man, why wear makeup? I have faced workplace discrimination but never spoke up because I didn't want to be ""that Woman"". Me too opened a dialogue and hopefully will make Men think twice before they act inappropriately. I have never asked for special treatment. Only the opportunity to do my job well and be noticed for my hard work. No favors, no quid pro quo."
"A man criticizing the me too movement? 
Sounds like an angry misogynistic  caller."
"The man doesn't have an example, so he's got nothing."
Comments saying David's been doing something with Jordan Peterson and he needs to explain himself. What's that about?
Power-drunk?!! Calling out men for their irresponsible abuse of power is being power-drunk?
Citation needed....this video has not David.
"This guy is right, women got carried away with the power they got from ruining men’s lives based on false accusations. You can only tell so many lies before utterly destroying your representation."
I will give you an example: the comedian that had his career ruined by a woman who had a bad date and then accused him of sexual assault. Makes the rest of us men nervous that it could happen to us.
"Insane,  absolutely insane."
"That's why as a dude, i want nothing to do with feminism"
"Al Franken is the perfect example of this. There just happens to be a new claim from a Dem staffer on the morning Time magazine revealed it's person of the year was the women of the ""Me Too"" movement. Then Gillibrand and Harris just happen to have statements ready to call for Franken's resignation. It was all way too contrived."
What the fuck was that? These are the type of people that have the right to vote on a president. Smh..
This guy's talking point is so 2017.
aziz ansiri is a good example ???
He's probably hoping his past doesn't come back to bite him. Don't be a perv
"""can you give examples of your claim?""
""WELL OBVIOUSLY YOU JUST DON'T LIKE MY CLAIM SO I'LL MOVE ON IT'S OK YOU'RE JUST NOT THINKING"""
Pakman is the best at handling these types of people
Me Too is the new McCarthyism.  Look at the Vic Mignogna situation. #Istandwithvic
This made zero sense
"David, in the future, would you ever consider running for president?"
"I love how when David tries to truncate his claim to something more specific that makes sense, the caller hits him with “weLL yOU JuSt DoN’T LiKe tHiS nArRative!”, implying David is being dodgy or something🤦‍♂️"
"Okay I feel like nobody was actually listening to his argument. He's actually pretty correct here. A large portion of insecure male voters have been wronged in their personal lives and are more afraid than is probably justified. There are far fewer cases of public rape and sexual assault allegations proven false than there are those confirmed or unconfirmed, but it is quite palpable seeing innocent men lose their jobs and credibility because of a consensual drunken night out with women they couldn't trust.

Overall, I think it doesn't impact my voting habits one bit. I would not vote for a candidate based on identity, but much of the country is a lot more tribal than that. They would definitely project valid fears in their personal lives into insecure and unjustifiable fears about voting for a woman.

And David was being intentionally stubborn in his manner of speaking with this man, probably pressed for time, but there are many cases of known male public figures like Al Franken or Aziz Ansari, or even drummed up allegations like Louis C.K. which resulted in flooring people's livelihood and respect based on private issues where less wrong was done than was portrayed.

The fear is valid and shouldn't be dismissed. SOME activists and women in the Twitter mob have definitely hurt their cause, and no, that does not validate not voting for Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris on the basis of sex.

Alright done with my ramble."
This is what happens when you wake up with Sam Harris and watch Dave Rubin discuss high level ideas.
"The caller has lost ""total control"" and is still a little sore about it.🥺 
And my favorite Trump nickname is, ""Trumplethinskin"". 👍"
"It’s really frustrating to listen to decent men make antifeminist claims with bogus arguments. I am close to some of them and think that if I just heard their opinions online, I would have a completely different picture of who they are."
When you realize what kind of person you're talking to 2:56. Lol what a genius this guy is.
I'm glad this guy is the authority on how to wield power...
"To all the people in the comments here, what the caller is talking about is the fact that women have in more recent times been falsely accusing men for rape, sexual harassment, and sexual misconduct while getting away with it. For so long, we generally have viewed women as these poor innocent creatures that can't do no wrong and that men are generally the bad people. I myself believed that and I'm a man. However, after having a former friend of mine turn on me and accused me of being too pushy on her, even though she one night snuck on to me and took a picture of herself laying on top of me without my concent , I've had a different view on these cases of rape that pop up now. Now, after witnessing how a woman can turn on me in the blink of an eye, leaving me confused about what I've done, and then lie about it to others, I no longer can fully belive these women when they make these claims. One thing we seem to not understand is that women can be just as manipulative as men to get their way. In fact, it's arguably easier for them since women for the most part are more emotional then men. At least, I know from my experience that that's the case. I as a man don't have a lot of emotions. Hell, it's very hard for me to cry. I didn't even cry when my grandparents died.

The point is that the ME Too movement has eccentuated women to do what ever it takes to get their way; even if it means lying to the point that it ruins a man's life. And with how we're inclined to instantly believe what a woman says without hesitation, that's how some women out there have become powere hungry. Remember, there have been a lot of horrible men through out history, but there can be despicable women too. Never assume one gender is completely innocent."
"I love when David responds to these kinds of ""we all know it happens"" type claims with a request for an example because they never have one."
"The caller brought up an interesting point that should be explored, but instead was summarily dismissed. This manic PC culture now prevents people to even consider the possibility that a movement like ""me too"" can go too far. By the way, if you want an example of someone being prosecuted in the court of public opinion based on accusation alone, Brett Kavanaugh is a perfect example."
Me can't count to two
Why do you waste time putting people on who are doing nothing more than trying to manufacture consent for their bullshit narrative?
😂 this call was something else.
Agent orange...get it?! *GeT iT?!*
"While the caller is a bit snarky, he's saying that the principle of the ability to accuse someone without having to prove guilt.  Basically the simple act of accusation = a result for the impacted accused individual (in the case of Metoo typically female v male). This is what he was trying to articulate, and I may not have done a great job with my articulation either, I nonetheless understand the sentiment that it feels like if a person is going to accuse someone that they should have to prove guilt as opposed to the accused have to prove innocence."
"The ""Meetiya"". 

Lol."
pretty sure this was david feldman doing a comedy bit. he called into the majority report too 😂
"That has more to do with trial by media rather than a gender issue. Like anything else when MSM get a new thing, it becomes a force of its own. This caller was clearly a troll and a bit of a twit."
"Ya why couldn’t  the women just keep their mouths shut, wa wa wa"
I would say an example is what happened to Al Franken.
Maybe ask Kirsten Gillibrand what she thinks about this idea.
"I kind of agree with the caller. I wonder if some of the men who lost their jobs because of the Me Too movement (for example, Tavis Smiley) really deserved it, and I think some women (for example, Yvette Vega) haven't really paid a price for their complicity.

Don't get me wrong, I think the Me Too movement is _mostly_ a good thing, but I don't support everything that has happened."
"I think the caller has a point. The #MeeToo movement has in some way ""victoried itself to death""."
Such misogyny from a gay man total control?’ Srsly wtf?
The name says it all... Total Control... and it sounds like he resents not having it. Did he really expect a movement to police individual claims.
I've been waiting for David to go full James O'Brien from LBC for a while. I need a full show of this.
This guy smells his own farts and doesnt make sense
"xXTotalControl871Xx: Women in the MeeToo movement are irresponsibly wielding their power.
David: What's an example of this happening?
xXTotalControl871Xx: He said, she said. Something something Lucy Flores Jake Tapper.


Dis your brain on MAGA."
2:44 2:56 lol 😆
"Power hungry women.



Scary 😨"
"David while the guys opinion might be kind of stupid, it’s pretty condescending to interrupt and strawman the argument every turn. Your clarification on this bugs me."
What
"The most I’d give this caller is that misogynistic voters may be more activated in reaction to #MeToo. Similar to how social gains for the LGBTQ, the growing minority-majority, and increased political power for minorites have activated reactionaries for quite some time now"
"David, you have the potential to easily have 4-5 million subscribers. You are the same personality type as Andrew Yang, but he has shored up his weaknesses in EQ and social intelligence. You are an intellectual giant, but without balancing out your innate weaknesses, you are holding yourself back. You are right at that age where INTJs tend to clue in to their weaknesses and everything gets better. Especially your most valued intuition (it goes through the roof) and personal relationships. I am the same type and I have learned a lot from Yang. You could learn a lot from him too."
"i think that not going through with the accusations might have caused some problem for women, but i dont know what type of problem. So many accusations against trump that ended without any resolve, but i also dont know what they could've done, since if the women were sexually assaulted they should come forward."
David:  Please be more discerning with your video postings.  Save the lame ones for the community forum.
He asked him specifically many time for an example and then he spouted Flores then the caller backed off and said that's what your saying??... ?? Wtf I had to listen 3 times to try to understand what he was getting at... it's still a mystery. How many licks does it get to the center of a tootsies pop
I will give you the examples of Aziz Ansari and Al Franken...beyond that I cannot think of any other abuses of the Me Too movement.
"""Ok boomer"""

"Sorry David, i can't hear his shit.💋🇫🇷"
"2:35 
Total control had a point. He gave you an example, and you overly simplified it so as to make it seem non-sensical. I dont know anything about this hair-sniffing scandal, but I wish you greased the argument's wheels further so that I could get the chance to hear a proper rebuttal from you and possibly a counter-argument from him about the topic."
What is this show anymore?
I can’t believe I was about to give this guy the benefit of the doubt (off video title alone). I agree that he definitely should have just left a voicemail. He *does* sound like a goddamn creep.
"The guy is bringing up something many people like him feel. His thoughts are shared by more people one would like to believe is possible (men and women alike). They should be allowed to speak there piece since if they don't, there will be no resolution to this problem that exists. The guy wasn't prepared for the questions he was getting."

"Ça ces notre beau pays !! un voleur de nourriture prendra du ferme un violeur prendra du sursis , cette justice ces : Touche à ma fille , Mets touche pas à mon portefeuille. Quel honte ce pays !!!"
Scandaleux.
Parcequ'il ėtait toujours autorisé à des cours de gynécologie.... normalement il est interdit nationalement et la sanction des écoles est sans retour
Justice soi. Même….
Qui protège cet étudiant ? Et surtout qui protégera ses futures patientes ? Notre système judiciaire est une honte.
J'imagine que personne ne fera aucun lien dans cette affaire 😅
C'est complètement dingue cette histoire
"Une vraie vocation chez lui, la gynécologie..."
"Le principal, c'est quand même qu'il soit un BON médecin, capable de SOIGNER les gens qui ont une vraie MALADIE. Je ne me fais aucun souci pour les ""agressées"" qui auront toujours toute latitude pour se plaindre. Quand on sait ce qui est qualifié ""d'agression"" par beaucoup de victimes, on prend peur pour leur santé mentale."
5 v*ol -> 5ans de prison Les personnes v**lées -> Reste gravé à jamais ou du moins longtemps. Courage à toutes les personnes qui ont subis ce jaure de choses.❤️🕊️
"Cet avocat a defendu Nordhal Lelandais...
Bref !"
"Je ne comprendrais jamais pour quelle raison en France personne ne se positionne en faveur des victimes. Mais quel est leur problème ? Je ne comprends pas pourquoi on défend les pédophiles et les violeurs et on condamne deux trois pauvres gars qui vendent du shit à des peines bien plus graves.... 
Pays en dérive complète.... Société malade 😮"
ca donne envie de se faire justice soit meme. Ce monde est corrompu et injuste.
Le laxisme des responsables judiciaires et de nos fonctionnaires en charge de respecter leurs missions et au service des citoyens.
"C’est pas rare qu’en médecine il y ait des cas d’agression. Pour avoir étudié dans la filière deux ans, je me rappelle qu’il y a déjà eu des cas d’attouchement et vi*l dans ma promo. On peut avoir peur si c’est ça les médecins de demain."
Suis je étonnée de l absence de réaction et de la décision de la justice .... Non. On sait d'avance qu'elle sera la décision... Comme d'hab injuste décevante et incompréhensible.... Le monde devient fou. Que Dieu nous protège.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻rien à rajouter
La gynécologie et obstétrique devrait être interdit à l'homme.
"Le principe de précaution pour la protection des patientes ,par pitié !!!!"
"Honte à la justice.
Honte à l'université."
"Sans trop de rapport, évitez de mettre des lumières clignotantes dans les vidéos, merci. Les épileptiques vous remercieront."
Deja un homme qui veut travailler la dedans c'est déjà bizarre
Incroyable...
Ont veut son nom ?
Prendre de l’argent à l’état et plus grave que de violer une personne si la justice continue à être autant bête il y’aura plus d’agresseur que de dealer
Honteux 😢 belle justice si elle existe 😢
"Je veux bien que l'avocat laisse à cet étudiant, la possibilité de donner des cours particuliers à ses filles. C'était dans un cadre festif, donc ça va passe"
"5 plaintes Rhooo. Ça va  .. faut pas chipoter,.. sympa l avocat , voit clairement qu il métrise le sujet , il a les moyens le stagiaire ! Issue de  bonne famille .."
"vive la justice du pays des droits de l’homme , elle fait honte a beaucoup."
"Pour info, son avocat à défendu nordal lelandais🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮"
Alors la c fou... comment il faut se battre pour se protéger et etre en sécurité
Quand on voit qui est son avocat On se demande de quelle communaute
"5 ans avec sursis mais où est Bardella pour en parler, c'est incroyable."
"Waouh l'argument de l'avocat ""oui i la violé mais ce n'était pas dans le même contexte donc ca compte pas"" ??? 
Dans ce cas on ne peut *jamais* privé quelqu'un d'accès, ni même l'emprisonner, car le contexte change toujours (au pire il y a la temporalité ""c'était avant"").
Bon après c'est le boulot de l'avocat de défendre sont client, mais le Juge ! Comment a-t-il put accepter cela ?"
C'est quoi cette Justice qui protège les violeurs et autres Pédos et emprisonnent les victimes??!!! LA C'EST TROOOOPP!!!
"a une epoque pas très lointaine, les etudiants se seraient occupe de son cas sans l'aide des tribunaux!. Un petit coup de bistouri au bon endroit, et le probleme est resolu."
"On vit dans un monde ou des personne qui vole de largent de quelconques maniere prennent plus de temps de prison que des violeur en tout genre.
Cest a ce moment la quon sait que largent dirige le monde et pas le coeur."
"Avocat de polanski? Tout est dit. Enfant de boss, avocat de boss, jugement de boss"
Il est le fils de qui?
D'accord donc le mec à 5 plainte pour agression sexuelle et vous le mettez en gynécologie gg gars
La bonne question c'est qui est derrière (papa ou tonton) pour qu'il soit aussi protégé.
😱😱😱😡
"J'adore l'argument ""oui mais c'était pas de le cadre de ses études""... Ben oui parce que c'est bien connu qu'un gars qui sait pas se tenir en dehors de son école va se tenir quand il aura plus de profs et un permis d'exercer... en particulier dans une profession où il sera face à des femmes à moitié nues et vulnérables...

5 viols c'est pas juste un malentendu avec une copine pendant une soirée, c'est de la perversion à ce niveau là et c'est dangereux de laisser ce mec exercer dans le milieu médical. Si on refuse les gens avec des casiers judiciaires dans la fonction publique, il y a une raison et pour les métiers de la santé ça devrait être pareil.

D'ailleurs je comprends pas non plus qu'après 5 viols reconnus le gars ait pas une obligation de soins parce que ça va clairement pas dans sa tête."
Faut donner un nom pour protéger nos enfants
"Déjà il n'a pas à être viré de son travail si ces faits ont été en dehors du lieu de travail. Ensuite il a été reconnu coupable, donc il devrait aller en prison si ces faits sont en l'état des viols. Si les faits ne sont pas reconnus, rien. Si ces faits sont reconnus : prison .. c'est pas compliqué."
"Pour le coup il est nécessaire de différencier vie professionnelle et vie privée, un crime commis dans un milieu n'a pas forcément d'influence sur l'autre. Si ça avait été pendant les examens réalisés là oui il faut faire quelque chose, si c'est en privé c'est totalement différent."
il faut donner son nom et sa photo un point c'est tout. Comme ça il se sauvera loin pour se cacher
J'ai travaillé avec le Cabinet Jakubowicz
"Mais je vois que beaucoup ne comprennent toujours rien! 2 poids 2 mesures c'est gens la peuvent faire des génocides sans sanction, alors des viols!!!!! ils sont intouchable!"
Bizzare cette justice qui ne souhaite pas condamner les viols au sein de la société.
bizarre ça n'arrive jamais avec les urologues hein
Il a bien été orienté... Professionnellement parlant 😞
"Mais c'est quoi cette """"justice"""" qui refuse de condamner les violeurs ?? Le viol c'est censé etre 15 ans de réclusion pas 5 avec sursis !! J'en peux plus de ce pays de merde"
Dieudonné il est où  ?
Désolé mais je comprend pas trop l'affaire...
L'humanité va de mieux en mieux ..
Ca ne peut se passer qu'en France.
Énorme
"5 de sursis c'est comme si il avait rien eut , c'est grave qu'il est toujours le droit d'exercer 😡😡🙄🙄"
Origine et confession du pointeur ?
"Pas besoin de l’exclure de la fac, 20/30 de prison ca suffit il recommencera ses études a 50ans"
"Est-ve que c'est au moins vrai les accusations, elle sosnt où tes sources ¿"
Mais c est dingue
"Condamné à répétition et on ne bannit pas tout court du métier de médecin et on le condamne juste à 5 ans avec sursis ??????

J'imagine qu'il n'était pas arabe ou noir."
le jours qu'il aura son propre cabinet et qu'il sera seul avec ses patientes il va ce regaler......
