Don't apologize to these witches. You stand your ground. He was absolutely correct. He didn't hurt a soul.
"Sounds like Tony meant what he said, but apologized to cover his ASS. He was being an adult BULLY to that woman who had the courage to SPEAK UP to him."
Stand your ground Tony. You were correct. Don't back down to these movements.
Damn I am a girl. I am so disrespected!
men are losing their careers without due process. just because she says it where is the evidence.
"Exposing a perpetrator empowers one, that takes courage, helps protect others and is down right heroic. Remaining silent, that’s a right...because of fear, because of PTSD, and other issues."
He was right this is why causes become cultish
Mgtow
Tony is a bad man
#whynow
"Rapist will come out and try to defend themselves and their fellow brotheren with many reasons but it only make them look guilty, like that show when they caught them with cameras trying to pick up kids for sex.   Compare his demeanor to one of those rapist who think they can get away with  rape, murder etc 

I see a rapist"
https://youtu.be/Ui3S-ZlIDp4?si=D43uzuqSTniHq44-
Tony Was right. Stop crying
men are losing their careers without due process. just because she says it where is the evidence.
"Many men are fed up with all the ""rules"" and are simply opting not to talk to women at all."
Men are not “scared” or “intimidated”.   We have observed the minefield and chose a path to avoid it entirely.  We are walking away….
"Ironically, the MeToo movement has become the very harassment that it claims to fight."
"Dont say anything at all, just ignore women, full stop."
"MeToo didn't destroy men.
It woke us up"
"Stop complimenting women, easy."
Every guy I know young or old is absolutely done with women! WAY too much hassle. NOT WORTH IT!!!!!
"Women actually destroyed the workplace the moment they joined it. 

Everything is like walking on eggshells, just waiting for this highly emotional being to find any reason to tick off."
The feminist movement destroyed men long before the Me Too movement came along.
"The same women will make reels and tick tocks asking, 
"" Why don't men approach me in public? "" 
"" Where are all the good men?"" 
"" Why don't men include me in social circles at work?"" 
"" Dating culture is dead in Australia."""
"So called ""strong women"" are threatened by compliments."
The women complaining about men giving compliments are the ones who are jealous because they don’t get any.
Chivalry is dead….you women killed it.
The reason why hr exists is because of women. No hr on the building sites i work on
We’re also sick of being treated as expendable.
"The world is falling apart because men like me just went “alright” and let the women take charge. Are things better? Do you feel safer? Are you happy, now?"
"I avoid all vvomen as much as humanly possible. I'm happy with that, and I am sure they are too. The peace is extraordinary."
"""Me too"" was a wake up call for men."
"Men just switched off, and women are noticing it. Most guys will only go out of their way to interact and help out a small number of women who are related to them. Helping out female strangers? Not worth the risk."
"I refuse to even make eye contact with them on the street at this point. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
"Just like modern feminism. It's not about fundamental rights anymore, but about how much you can get by complaining and playing the victim."
"It’s not the me too movement. It’s that modern women are entitled, have internalized a lot of negative beliefs about men, and don’t feel like they need to offer anything to the relationship. No thanks"
Ignore women… period.
"It's incredibly patronising to be told what you can and can not say as adults and professionals. Treating men like children is commonplace now. Seriously, how did we get here."
"The last time I gave a female co worker a compliment I got called up to HR and they said I apparently made an ""inappropriate remark"". They warned me not to do it again and now I avoid her like the plague. All I said to her was that she looked nice that day because I could tell she put effort into her hair and makeup before work, wasn't even flirting for real as I knew she had a longterm boyfriend.
Never doing that again. Just don't do it fellas."
"Thank you for the compliment. I'm one of the good guys who left the dating scene years ago. When I was still working it got to the point I never talked to women. I went MGTOW to protect myself, my peace and to stay safe."
The same comment from a Chad will elicit a totally different reaction than from an unattractive man----possibly a call to HR.
Construction workers need a massive pay rise. That'd save a lot of men
So MEN's speech is being policed. Shocker.
It hasn't destroyed men. It has shown them who women really are.
I wouldn’t say destroyed- I would say it made us all see the light.
"""Fuckable"" was not on the list though, so maybe they could say it."
"""You're so beautiful"" does come across as cringe, especially in 2025. Gentlemen, don't do it. Treat them like men."
"if i spent that much money on a ticket just to be told my speech is to be policed, i'd demand a refund of 200% for every man there, and then have us all leave."
"The biggest problem is that the men who actually have good intentions and respect women listened and did what they said, they stopped approaching or even talking to you at all. The creeps who want to take advantage of women already didn't care if what they were doing was wrong, and so they continued on as usual. So all you achieved was removing any good men from the equation. Funny how the bullies never had trouble getting dates, the abusers, the criminals, never known any of them to struggle with women. Good men who respect and care about women? They mostly die alone after a life of being invisible. Why are we shocked when the younger generations are following Tate etc when all they ever see are good men suffering and bad men winning?"
It destroyed relationship dynamics and also promoted false victims meanwhile the actual victims are drowned out.  Men adapted as we always do.
"It didn’t destroy men. It just changed them to consider life without women, and for the most part it’s a positive experience."
Men are fed up with the overreach and the planned destruction of men by the people behind this movement.
I'd ask for a refund right there. Give me my $500 dollars back and I'll spend my time doing something else.
"I have not complimented a woman in years. Frankly, I don't care anymore."
I just married a woman from a non Western culture. I don't need to ask her what she brings to the table. I don't need to ask what I get back for all the energy I put in. It's obvious.
I live by one rule. Never compliment a woman ever!
Don't blame metoo. Blame the women who joined it or promoted it AND the women who were sucked into believing it.
HR isn’t a necessary part of a company
"One of the reasons I gave up romance and I know I am not the only one to do so. Women want to be left alone, they got their wish."
It has freed a lot of men from devorce rape and false allegations ❤
Gender policing is descrimination. Do not participate in such misandry.
Enjoy your career in 'cybersecurity.' The jeets will have your jobs in short order.
"🤷‍♂️ Gentlemen, simply walk away. I can assure you, your silence will be greater than any “offensive compliment” a woman has ever received."
"""destroyed"" = set them free 😂😂😂😂"
"The ""metoo"" movement hasn't made any impression on me, I can assure you Danica😂😂😂😂"
"Anything bad that has happened to women at miscellaneous moments in history will pale in comparison to the catastrophic mistake of MeToo.

Women didn’t just screw men over during that movement, women screwed themselves, each other, their daughters, younger sisters; anyone that now has to navigate the world today post MeToo. 

Most men and women are alone now because for men, it’s not worth risking their lives and reputations on speaking to, approaching or associating with the wrong woman.

It’s over and there no going back now."
"$500 per ticket - nice.
Women need their own award ceremony - great.
Being told how to speak - fabulous."
"In a work environment, always compliment with ""You look almost competent"" instead of ""You look sexy."""
"The ""MeToo"" movement has left women single for life.
Men are not destroyed, they are doing their own thing without women.
Bye, bye ladies."
"They basicly ban the legit compliments ...
Did they hand notes to women ?

God, lately I do regret being part of this mankind ..."
Men are having the last laugh as they walk away and give feminists what they want at first and later regret.
Can you imagine if you reversed the genders and a man handing out a pamphlet to all the women explaining how to be appropriate.
"Most women think this is fixable,
They are wrong, 
They are starting to see that men are not scared,
WE ARE DONE, 
AND DONE MEANS PERMANENTLY DONE."
"There’s an old saying: least said, soonest mended.  When in doubt, hold your tongue.  Silence may be misunderstood, but it can never be misquoted."
"Women only want compliments from Chads.  Every other man need not offer their compliments, thank you very much."
And women wonder why men stopped even approaching them at all.
"""MeToo"" didn't destroy men at all.  To most men it restored (or should have restored) knowledge they should have known from childhood regarding the realities of women's nature and behavior.  It demonstrated very loudly what women naturally are.  It reminded us of what societies throughout human history inherently knew but our society somehow forgot.   If anything, ""MeToo"" returned men's regard of women back in line with nature and objective reality.  Men's behavior toward women now is the natural response to these women's natural behaviors.  This is why societies worldwide throughout history managed women they way they did.  If they didn't, this happened and the society collapsed.   Organize your regard for women and your behavior with women by what women naturally do and how they regard you and treat you when free to do so, observe what is happening now -- let that be your teacher and guide.  This is what women really are.  Plan and respond accordingly."
"No, no, it set men free, best thing that ever happened"
The women insecurity award. That would be a tough battle.
I like how they only handed these to men. As if women can't possibly be creepy and innapropriate at a workplace.
"The women's movement won the battle, but lost the war."
"2017 August lost job because a female and outsourced workers claimed I exposed myself, multiple cameras displayed the true testament, yet I was the one in the wrong...""me too"" can lay in the bed it's created, made an indefinite enemy."
Actually the metoo movement destroyed women. Men walked away and women lost their minds
"Giving power to those who have no loyalty, wisdom, conscience, or morals invites chaos. 

These women will be in a bad mood and will destroy a man based on accusation alone. 

And look at the results- more enmity."
"I no longer mentor women. They don’t need help. The men need help in the workplace, most of the women are DEI hires"
"As a man cruising into middle age i have mates who are single / divorced. They now refuse to date because its too dangerous. They live in fear of slander and false accusation. One has admitted to me he plans to be celibate and die alone, numerous dates with all kinds of women they no longer ask about work, taste in music etc but from 1st minute of sitting down cross examine him on polical views. He told me when he realised he was trying to get a table with plenty of cctv on him he just went stuff it, ill stay hm."
"If it flies, floats or phucks, it's cheaper to rent."
I worked in and office and women would ask me from time to time what I thought of their outfits. I refused to answer.
"You can just take out the space between ‘In’ and ‘Security’, and it works perfectly."
Glad I’m old and not having to date. If I were a young man and woman approached me at the bar I would immediately think I was being set up.
The juice is no longer worth the squeeze.
"""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"". Clip from old move, still relevant to-day!"
"Glad that
1) I wouldn't go to an event like this
2) I never compliment women I don't know"
And very soon technology will destroy and replace women
It used to be comical that people would have such audacity to be policing others in such a childish way. It really is just an embarrassing grab for authority in position when there really is nothing to be had
"I for one, am not ""destroyed"". My single male friends rejoice at being woman free.🇦🇺"
"No no no.
Its destroyed women and freed men"
"Just say they look dreadful, and if they had a issue, tell them they did not want us to say nice things, so we went just as negative as they are"
Do not bother with them full stop
"If it were my list, I’d have Nothing on it because Modern women deserve Nothing. 👎"
"I read through a couple of hundred comments here, not a single one from a woman. That's very telling."
"LOL. I don't feel ""absolutely destroyed"". Drink some whiskey. Get over it. Remember, gentlemen: You are always fertile. The biological clock is her responsibility. Choose wisely."
"Just sue in court the woman who did this note only to m'en fir discrimination and sexisme, lol !"
I don’t even call it the me too movement because I call it the lie too movement because most cases around the world have been proven to be lies.
Him downplaying it doesn't really help to raise awareness
Removing compliments in this situation actually hurts females more than men.
"I can see how this will end up.  Men will only be able to say ""Hello Cynthia, you look okay tonight."""
"ignore women, do not grant them any space whatsoever"
"I just don't speak to them at all anymore.  Only if necessary, and very brief about it.  They bring nothing but trouble and drama."
"The problem in not that women get an unwelcomed compliment, it's the fact that women who expect that compliment do not recieve it."
Were was the note to the women why are they able to say you look handsome
"3:22 She claims that most people know intuitively what is appropriate and what isn’t.

The problem isn’t “most people” it’s the fringe, radical outliers that use the system to batter men. These crazies use law as a weapon to “smash the patriarchy” or “score points for the Sisterhood” … at the expense of reasonable men."
Bypass the self crippling deal of modern marriage and just adopt if you want to start a family.
"Toxic feminism has destroyed the appeal of women, and the result is collapsing birth rates, and about to collapse welfare states and pensions."
The best move started from Kerala ! We need such report in all industry 🎉
"Kerala is the first to appoint a committee to learn about the industry problem..
Other industries also should have this type of courage"
Mollywood does create impactful cinema and is the first in the film industry to establish a committee to ensure safety and equality for women. Kudos to Mollywood for spearheading this important reform.
Kudos to the actresses of Malayalam film industry for stepping up and fighting courageously while other industries use women for pleasure and benefits....🎉
He should resign . But enquiry must be conducted and if  any action against law must be proceeded with.
"I am a man and I find it despicable that a woman, or anyone, should be forced to respect anyone against their free will."
"I am happy this has started atleast with Malayalam cinemas, Respect to those who came forward and acknowledged this.Now it's time for others too, I am sure this happens in bollywood and others too. It's high time now for everyone to stand up and speak. Let more of Hema committee be formed. Let this be a lesson for other too."
Malayalam film industry is totally cleaning all the mess and its for good future.. but other industries face the same but no one is taking initiative for this cleansing process! Everyone should stand up for this 👍
"You lost your case when you said Today Super star .. He is an actor.. How come any actors become super stars wen they are ready to entertain, dance, drama for 3 hours for 100 rupees ? Society is screwing them.. They are actors, period.. Superstars are our parents who work day and night for us, our teachers , our friends who help us etc.."
Women are so badly treated.😢😢😢 Shameful.😢😢😢
Same or worst exist in Bollywood.... Why only talk about mollywood
"Now set up a committee to investigate Media, Politics, Police etc.. Lets hema committee be the first step towards this..."
"The important thing to notice is that the movies that arebreaking
Barriers anyways have not included this powerful nexus of actors... They always have been incapable of any progress"
"Salute to you all for exposing the corruption and exploitation. From pakistan. You all are on the right path. 
Nothing would have happened if this was pakistan ."
"Why did he resign now. FEAR of being prosecuted or defamed ??? How convenient. He must have know all the happenings including the kidnapping & rape & torture of the actress, for SURE. But remained silent so his and his sons career is not affected. There is no way he did not know. Now he wants to play god. Super 👍🏼"
What about media industry?
Good job... these pervert film production related criminals should be ashamed.
Its the same or worst in other film imdustries of south ..they dont come out
I had huge respect for Mohanlal before seeing this video
Do u understand this is the first time an industry going forward and correcting .
"🙊 This is the kind of society we live in, which govt, what law, what police, what feminism?!!!! Women are unsafe."
They're right to be punished.
I ❤ Palki Sharma#she' s an honest journalist and says everything clear and cut throat! Keep rocking 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Hypocrisy at its peak. 😊
Exactly… but it's not only in the Malayalam industry but I feel it's in Bollywood too. And they don't even know that they are abusing the weakest. And they are proud of doing it.
Mohanlal seems to successfully accomplished 1000 women in toto😢
Should just be a precedent to many others that must be investigated throughout India.. toughest punishment should be handed over to such power group operators.
When will India start treating women with respect
Their State & National awards should be withdrawn if proved guilty !!
"This issue is true in every other filim industry here in India (or world)
I hope we get them to also get a expose of them ..."
"There is something which nobody noticed, there is hidden lobby against leadership of AMMA , they Jailed Dileep for crime done by Pulser Suni, 
Director Kamal (original name is Kamaal ) and director Renjith did the same crime but only Renjith had to resign from same post, 
There is a Jihadi & Missionaries lobby behind this drama, no Muslim actor name is coming out except Siddique who was supporting Dileep,"
Kerala always leading cultural revolutions.. disrupting systems.. proud of you Girls and Boys ❤
HIGHEST LITERACY RATE FOR CRIMINOLOGY.
I am suprsed  to come to know the happening in the kerala film industries
Imagine a committe investigate about bollywood 😂
"Real face of Kerala. No jobs there people prefer to go outside of Kerala to work. No industries because of bad policies of Communist govt ruling the state. Achievements of Kerala people highest number of people recruited in ISIS, Malayalam Cinema scandal women are not safe in Kerala."
"Respect to mohanlal!! Nowaday  position holding people don't even resign even after such cases and reports.... 
Direct example... Brij bushan singh!!!!!"
Keep pushing for equality for women in 2024.
"Well said, reel and real life are two very different things! 👍🏾✌🏾"
"This is what kerala has been from the past.
Exploiting the powerless until a days everything is exposed.
It's shameful."
I love the newscaster ❤ very powerful.in that case.....well done 👍
He should be investigated and prosecuted if evidence exists against him. The crimes occurred under his leadership.
Why isn't the perspective not diplomatic and holistic. Mollywood speak up against violence and hold them accountable. Has even Hollywood done this?
Movie and reality is always different. What u see is what is not
A reel life hero but A real-life villain 😢
🎉🎉❤☔☔☔☔☔☔ Mam pal🎉☕ .. 🌄
"Mam, Entire flim industry in India works in same fashion among them one state alone got exposed !!!. Hope its one among the known secret's in india..."
Glad things are changing!
This is there in every place.There are such groups everywhere. There are such people in every industry. Like Tovino said let it be remembered that the change started with Malayalam cinema(as always).
It was high time Malayalam industry needed this clean up!
"Every where this type of thing's happen, In  it is very less compare to other other flim industries in India. Mean while what about media industries...??"
Well done Kerala.
What about Honey Rose?
"Shame on the  mallus  who are very  proud  of their  superstar mohanalal, this is what  expected  from a literate  state  .. wow"
"Universal all 'woods' globally practice. Somebody exits, someone else fills in. Next? ... if ok to entertain, enter into entertainment. Show must go on.
Love from India 🔱💯💖"
This is why a particular community has progressed in Kerala and other honest citizens were left out. Everywhere we go we see the result of such dirty deeds being done
Yet they are the ones breaking the ice ❄
"One thing I didn't understand what is the role of president of India, n our hounable p m should take action in this matter,"
I am speechless.
Tip of icedurg
Same is in Bollywood They block outsider as  far  as possible . U meet Sushant like fate if are ambitious
But the biggest issue is where is the actual proof. How is this any different from the Zomato case?
Do u think Mohanlal was not aware...??? Not possible
"Conduct such a committee enquiry in bollywood too. Kerala initiated this, the other states shall follow this way"
Woman rights and freedom of choice and speech.  The laws must be inforce now against corruption practices and exploitation.
Finally truth is taking over
"Irony :most literate state is reeling under casting couches (favours by men for work opportunities for women ) 
This is evident not only education is important,.
QUALITY EDUCATION IS NEED OF HOUR(SDG 4)"
"The HEMA committee you mentioned has nothing concrete other than a power group. 
A power group is the whole point of having a committee in the first place. Whether the committee is behaving decocratically or autocratically is the only question. 

If you don't have facts, don't compensate it with activism 😂😂😂"
Gods own country realities 👀🤷🏽‍♂️🙏🏽
"The matter shouldn't end there, resigning doesn't yield the desired results. The responsible culprits  should be arrested and prosecuted and finally be banned from the industry.  We can see, as in other cases,  the probe and the investigations, be it by anyone else, take their own time thus delay the justice  to the victims."
Good job Mohanlal.
"Where I come from, men stand when a woman walks in or is about to sit at a table 😂"
"This exists in every industry , just that people are shit scared to talk"
"BTW, the people who are under the scanner are not the new filmmakersthey are from 80s ..."
God's OWN COUNTRY 😂😂😂 100% literacy 👍👍👍
Never Ending Story....🤔
Beautiful palki with beautiful earrings ❤
"This news is misleading. He is not involved in any of the accusations. He resigned because many other actors were accused, and as the president of the association, he chose to step down"
Now mohanlal  must reveal the villains
"Malayalam industry is progressive to have an hema commission, why don't other industries do the same."
🙌🏻
"Madam palki I had deep respect for you, these ladies who are protesting are they innocent, all of a sudden they realized they were sexually assaulted 
 Today's generation are ready to do anything to get inside cinema. Then where is this humma commission 😊 never stoop low to report such crap"
AND AT THE CENTRE THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE BRIJBHOOSHANS RULE THE SPORTS FIELD. 😢😢
It's Happening all the indian film industries...May be International...
Well i regret resignation was late. Need investigation and Well done HEMA committee report. But nothing to do with women alone to stand. EVERYONE DOES
Dare any other government for such a report on their filim industry 😅
He also cheated an Tamil actress and she died few decades back
Good! Book the rest accused. We don't need them.

Why did you leave wion palki? Was that a mollywood power group initiation
Manipur CM should have resigned too but yet he is there . Not supporting anyone but why he has not resigned?
This happens in all film industry 😮 sad reality
How come Mammotty is not in news at all
Should be punished....
Firstpost has some new thing in hand now to talk about for a few weeks until they get something else😅
It's Kerala not India sarrrrr😂😂😂😂😂
"Exploitation is everywhere. It's in cinema industry, in media industry, in textile industry, in construction industry everywhere. I worked for a construction company in Adoor (Kerala) called Builtech Builders and I didnt get any salary and then I resigned.  There are a lot of people, men and women who left this company similar way. They would conduct interviews once in every 3-5 months offering big salaries and absorb people and then after 2-3 months these people would be laid off and they would get no salary or a meagre amount. During their tenure there these people would be mentally  tortured and would be rendered as good for nothing fellows. And you won't dare to complain as you would be intimidated by the photos that are being posted in the various company whatsapp groups by the MD showing himself standing with many top politicians and ministers of Kerala State. So exploitation is everywhere."
100 true
"Movie industry of india , they show it in their own movies like fashion , real life story of silk smitha the dirty picture , real life stories of women who gets into a toxic work culture... 
Make few women senior artist as head of the film department, this will solve the toxic work culture."
Will there be a committee for bollywood?
"My brother (at the time a 15y boy) was wrongly accused for rape together with a friend of his. 3 days in jail when the police didn't give them sleep and started questioning every half hour threatening my 15y old brother with violence.

After three days the victim showed up and looked through a one sided blind window and said she didn't recognize them, so they where free to go without the police saying sorry to the boys.

I got 3 other stories where boys and young men wrongly accused for rape and how our society is 99% of time siding up with females.

It is scary how much evil can be done by women with the blind support of police and society. Women that are blackmailing to get their way in live are the worst!"
"When sexually arrest men, and when a man tells her or he doesn’t say anything, people call him gay, but not knowing that it also makes him uncomfortable too, so he’s afraid to say something. People will judge him not judge him."
The black women is right
Blame Hollywood
We hire less women now because we don’t want our guys to get falsely accused.
This is why women dont come forward. These girls risked everything to tell their most embarassing stories. And this guy is walking free... i hope they are protected
"I saw a video of him lifting Cassie and slamming her, it broke my heart. This monster should be rotting in prison 💔"
Actually the real reason he isn’t being charged with the serious offences is because it happened in America. You guys elected trump again and he broke the law how many times? Celebrities and rich people are not treated like we are treated in the USA
He’s rich.
He’s rich and has people willing to do anything he asks.
As a survivor who was failed by the justice system this is so heartbreaking and devastating… I really thought it would be different this time but I’m not surprised. Heart just aches for the victims
We need more Mario's brother
"No, he walked because too many rich and famous people were involved ."
We live in a victim blaming society.
"Honestly, I’m not surprised that Diddy got away with a slap on the wrist"
The real reason he wasn't found guilty is because there was no proof. End of story
"Sadly, this isn't surprising"
If the stories are true he's committed much more heinous crimes then that he's being charged on. Just that his victims are too ashamed or afraid to come forward.
The fact that people are complaining the procescution didn't cater to the jury is disgusting. We truly are a country where facts don't seem to matter anymore. It could happen right in front of their face and they would need to be convinced it happened.
"Yeah honestly. The rule of law does not protect the innocent. Its main priority, especially in america, seems to be ensuring criminals are not convicted of too many crimes. Cause the prosecution was the government so they have access to as much evidence as they can sanction. All the defence has to do is figure out a way to weasel out of it. I think criminal lawyers get the easy ride too. They earn more and often use the tactic of badgering already vulnerable witnesses to weaken their testimony or relying on jury members being held in contempt. Just my perspective but i have VERY LITTLE faith in the rule of law as a woman. 
I see it fail us all the time, especially in SA cases, which is why we often refuse to report or press charges. Why bother when the odds are stacked against you even more"
Its not because he’s rich it’s because the thing jurors needed to believe was women in low standing and they would rather believe the man they’ve seen physical beat and abuse these people than the actual victims.
He is a waste of space and had a seriously gullible jury!🙄
"Disappointing, but not surprising."
Follow the money of the jury it will tell it all
"It wasnt the justice system that failed, it was the jury lol"
He 100% is going to be part of DT's administration
"Money talks, 💩💩 walks"
It was misogyny. They simply didn’t believe the women.
Of COURSE Trump would pardon him! Women have to unite NOW!!!
"The justice system worked as intended. To protect the interests and the persons with power. It is not, and never has been, about righteousness."
"Please let this dude rot in prison, he's been doing messed up stuff since the 90s."
"This is my third attempt to leave a comment on your video, but YouTube keeps deleting it.  The first comment was an intelligent response.  The second comment was me complaining about YT purposely deleting anti-Diddy comments and they even deleted that out!!!!  Let’s see if this third comment sticks.  Oh yeah!  There’s no intelligent comment in this third posting and the anti-Diddy stuff so yeah it’ll stick."
"Honestly, this verdict made me so upset and so disgusted at the geriatric jury! Stop having people from 1960. Make decisions for women in 2025. It’s absolutely disgusting. Sean is a human trafficking predator who beat and tortured women abused his employees literally committed Rico like activity and walked away because he’s famous tired. I hope the judge gives him the maximum I don’t care. I am furious with this."
"Weistein, Cosby and now Diddy.  Its absolutely disgusting how rich men just get a slap on the wrist"
Witness testimony is the worst form of evidence allowed in the legal system. It sounds like that's why he was not found guilty on those counts. You need something more solid than just a bunch of accusations to convict someone of a crime.
Trump wanted a taste of Diddy party
Rich and depraved are always protected
My point stands that Trump only ever pardons the worst people on Earth.
This whole thing is like a Boondocks episode
Victim blaming.NOT COOL!
And they'll tell women not to use the second amendment
Nope. The witnesses painted themselves as willing participants in the freak offs. Ruined the entire case the more they spoke. He will still do 5-10.
Because they were seeking life. I'm an up-to-20-year-total qualified juror.
Start dishing our your own justice ladies. Just know how to do it
outrageous.  They disregarded the victims.  Anyone found the children yet?  Disgusting!!!
Tell me something new 😢
The fact they keep saying he is going home with a possible 20 yrs sentence . Sounds like simething is shady. Make it make sense
"There was no evidence, I don't know why he even went to jail. I'm not saying he's not a bad person but the evidence wasn't there. I'm done with this channel this lady is too extreme"
"Close enough, welcome back R-Kelly trial"
"Alternatively, we dont know the whole story as we weren't presented any of the evidence nor did we hear any rebuttals against that evidence, all we knew were the charges. Reminder a prosecutor doesn't need beyond a reasonable doubt evidence to CHARGE someone with a crime, they only need Probable Cause"
"You push things too far in one direction, and the pendulum will swing back."
Such bull$hit
Why anyone has faith in The justice system is beyond me
Money
"Nope, all wrong. You have no idea of what's really going on here. I promise it has nothing to do with the metoo movement. This is WAY more complex than anything like that."
Those jurors should be ashamed.
"Lawyers are very skilled at discrediting women, they have methods to paint them as liars and twist their words into seeming like something it’s not. This is why women seldom speak up."
Yasssss. What about those kids and looking into child Protective Services. Where are these kids  coming from.
"All that baby oil was actually just to make sure no one could make the charges stick, apparently"
Free Luigi
20 years in means he’s gonna die 💀 in prison.
Oh well. Seems to me when someone is put in prison we say the system finally worked and when someone is found not guilty we say the system is broken.
"I didn't follow, but I've seen people saying he didn't even have a defense, no witnesses, nothing..."
Trump only pardoned him because he wants an invite to the next party.
Because he has too much money and has too much dirt on other wealthy people. That’s why!
"He’s being not guilty has nothing to do with being black! It’s because of being evil! Christ honors women and demonstrates it by choosing a woman for the 2 most honored responsibilities ever given: birth of Christ; and proclaiming, “He is Risen!” She became the first Evangelist!"
Stay inside
I'm not surprised
I have a friend who is angry about the Diddy verdict but is a full on Trump loving cultist. How do women like her not realize that all of this is tied together?
They didn't have more women on the jury because they couldn't find that many that couldn't say they havent been sexually assualted
Lame take
What about the jailhouse phone call Diddy made telling his sons to destroy the evidence in his house before the cops find it
A rico charge is for an organization not 1 person! That was stupid from the beginning.
Now he coming for the victims.
Amber Heard destroyed the MeToo movement
BTW Lil Tay Just Started Her OF
8 men and 4 women.... Wow. Okay. Probably could have gone with an equal amount of men and women.... That's why they didn't find him guilty.
"#1 is he is rich. #2 idk her name, but the one lady stayed with or came back to him after being raped and abused."
"""witch hunt"" 😂 this country sucks."
I'm sorry but women have a looong way to go to as far as same sentence for same crime n don't get me started on divorce and custody
Trump got him off
Classic. Smh 😪
💙🤮💙🤮💙🤮💙
😂😂😂 wtf is wrong with all. The counts were unanimous so what about the 4 women on the jury? Yup its all men's fault 😂😂
"It's violates human rights to want anyone ever to be convictable of anything, ever, only on believing a victim's word. Word against word is never ever evidence, hence never ever due process."
Also because money
Oof.
🤬
🫴⚖️
I have mixed feelings on the metoo movement especially in regards to the johnny depp and amber heard trial
Why doesnt nowthis post anything about israel?
"I know no details of this case, but it sure sounds like a good place to end jury trials.
Where I come from, we just don’t have them. We may need more judges, but it feels more suitable when times are changing but some people don’t want to go along with it."
That's a stretch to see that the democrat led search is motivated by metoo
You don’t get to have your cake and eat it too. Judy found they were willing participants so yea.
Lol shut up he rapped men to what are you talking about? Stop blaming men
Its all men.
"If that was on the drawer as a woman, I would’ve found him not guilty of every single charge"
Will trump pardon diddy?
"This is the thing with current dems. Most men who vote don't care about this. Woman are vindictive. The voting age men dont like the lgbthdtv movement, or the me too movement. This loses you supporters. i hate current republicans but i dont like the current dems. Most men have to chose the lesser of two bad choices. Shame on you guys forcing your opinions on the whole of dems."
Haha
It’s because the jurors voted not guilty on the serious charges.  A fair jury was chosen.  Maybe the government didn’t prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
For the people who don’t know when diddy was found guilty of “the transportation to engage” he was going to the house of women who worked at nowthis news cause that’s what they are
"Oohhh ummm the sentencing guidline is actually 27 months max. 
Which is why they prosecutors asked for 56 months not that 20 year bs yall heard and that 56 is stacking the charge which the guidlines dont call for so 27 months is the max. He won't get more like 18 to 20 months so diddy will be home by valentines day max 🤷🏾‍♂️ sorry that doesnt make you happy"
"There's more to it than not believing women. This limited scope will lead to villainizing jurors. There are elements of a crime that have to be met, beyond a reasonable doubt, to find someone guilty. Unless you're in the room or hearing jurors victim blaming, this hot take is irresponsible"
He’s not guilty
"What downfall? He's continued to write, direct and be successful."
Money buys you freedom
Downfall? He's successful
"He has, unlike the other two directors, been completely exonerated years ago."
"Non giudico l'uomo, non abbiamo gli elementi per farlo, ma come attore, regista, sceneggiatore è un vero genio, insuperabile. Quando sarà il suo momento lascerà un vuoto incredibile. È il mio preferito. 👋👋👋"
"They’ve been married for like decades, at what point do you just get over it and accept that their weird relationship worked"
Leave him alone. They are happy together and she has made zero complaints. Geez this place is trashed by propaganda and corruption. What a stench.
Festival boss Alberto Barbera is correct.
"Woody is 35 years older than I am, now that’s funny said Soon Yi"
"She's a survivor alright, she survived falling out of a tree and hitting every branch with her face on the way down."
I think men are running from her instead of harassing her
I'm kinda horrified that a woman is trying to make a difference and so many comments are negative and about her looks.
Looks exactly like KRS one!
"Here are some questions I would have asked:  
How is the Me Too movement affecting the way men treat women in business and in social situations?  
Are you concerned that the Me Too platform might have been used as a weapon to harm an innocent man?  
Do you think that men in the business world have more of an aversion to working with women because of your movement?
How is your movement affecting women's careers?
She asked all soft questions... her interview was more like an infomercial."
...guys take my advice. It ain't worth it. Much better things in life....spend your money on a new Corvette.
"How about a HASHTAG for  ----->  ""  People need to grow up and stop making false claims and get on with their pathetic lives and stop acting like spoiled brats that think the entire world owes them everything "" ?"
"I don't understand how people can be so childish and cruel. This isn't about her appearance, it's about the movement. 

Existing in the age of YouTube comments is a curse of our modern world."
Y’all are the reason why women are afraid to come out about sexual harassment. It’s ridiculous smh.
"What about the men who got sexually assaulted as lil boys ,,,talk about that"
She looks unrapable though
"In the history of the world, there have never been so many innocent individuals who have been members of any given movement."
"It started as a great thing, but some people ruined it. The Me Too Movement should be about men and women of any color coming together because of the horrible things they’ve experienced, not a platform for people to gain attention through empathy for fake stories. People lying makes others suspicious of people who really went through things like this, which defeats the purpose of the whole movement."
"Sometime back, I can  remember on the news, a professional football player was accused of something by the me too movement. I can't remember the details of the case. But it turned out that the woman made the whole thing up. They found this guy innocent. But it didnt matter, he lost his career. I think the me too movement is made up of predators."
#notme
"Are you sure, what happened with her comes under Sexual Harassment not under Cruelty Against Animals?"
Who harassed this woman? Omg
Nothing for nothing but what man in his right mind would wanna hit THAT?? EWWWWWWW!!!!!! Should be more like #me-never
I opened a door for a woman and I was accused of sexual harassment
Who would harass that cow?
The best this woman can ever be is handsome.
"A person's character is everything, not how they look.. :) She is courageous to start such a movement against injustice.. Please stop judging ppl by they looks and have a broad mind.."
Tara Reade wants justice too!
"All women have to do is accuse and you lose. boy, that's real justice. hey ladies! what goes around comes around!"
Why are people more considered about her face and how she looks when the whole movement is about how sexual harassment of any kind shouldn’t be acceptable. Honestly it hurts to see people talk about how a person looks when  they clearly don’t have a clue of what may have happened to them . The whole movement is to educate others who aren’t aware of the situation or problem and help victims not to distinguish if celebs sell their bodies for a role . At the end of the day it’s clear to indicate the right from the wrong and it shouldn’t be right for people to harasses others in activities they don’t want to do for both men and woman .
"Wow, seems kinda odd to me that this lady was sexually harrassed. That is one ugly woman, guess there are some desperate dudes out there in the world. Yikes."
This comment section is exactly what is wrong with the world
If KRS don't come get his daughter. She out here trippin!
"the man who sexually harrased this women was either blind, mentally imbalanced or simply trying to win a bet from his mischeavous friends....."
I have a deep regard for the displaced and the forgotten and the abused and the bullied and victimized of all ages .
"A movement based on empathy I can understand. Currently, bigots have shifted focus from the issue of those being sexually harassed and assaulted. To the many women who falsely accused men of sexual assault."
"""Whoop Whoop, that's the sound of the beast!""  ""Whoop Whoop, that's sound of the police!"""
I dont think this person has any reason to be part of the me too movement.
God bless this Sister. She started this for one reason and it turned into something bigger. She has beautiful energy.
She is full of stuff and a liar
I'm white i was raped by my brother at the age of 8  I blocked it out until I finally fell in love at 19 and at 23 I started having flashbacks . There is a lot more to my truth but it is very long . I have had no support other then my husband and he has been so grate at 14 I was put in a mental hospital  for evaluation and then put on lithium that made me sick and then prozak that made me violently angry . So I gave upon pills and just forced life . It's all a mess .  It is not just females of color it's not just certain economical classes it is not ever just a female issue yes it's mostly a female issue . How ever it is always a human issue why can't we just say that ?
She look like the lady in the tavern who harasses all the men in the bar but no one wants to take her home
"women complain when you look at them, and then complain when you don't!"
"I love how the hashtag is also called a pound sign, so their movement is essentially pound me too"
Y’all are destroying our black men why
who in their right sense would even approach this so called founder???!!! Ugh!
This comments system is truly disgusting U should be ashamed of yourself for being so cruel to this woman who is just trying to make a difference
"She made this in 2006 you dont know how she looked then and dont be so quick to judge a persons appearance,  your looks will fade and all youll have left is your legacy. At least she is building hers what the heck are you doing with your life?"
This “movement” has erupted into a groundswell of false accusations against men in the workplace and elsewhere...
"Whos mans is this??? 

Stop saying Women or people of color (Black women, men and children) 

Got bamboozled again"
I wanna know how harrassed Burke! Because she definitely has a face for radio!
"Wait... someone sexually harassed THAT lady..? Please....
Me too movement is just a way to further oppress good men."
Newly-resurfaced video from decades ago lends support to allegations against Joe Biden
Who is the inhuman monster that sexually assaulted her? He needs to have his head examined by human and animal behavioral psychologists. This is too much. Never again
Leslie Jones is prettier than the Me Too lady
"Oh look, it's krs one"
Yeah no one is abusing that female with a nose and face like that…
For a minute I thought I was looking at Shrek because that broad looks like Donkey without Eddie Murphy's voice.
I'm 100% convinced that she's has never been the victim of sexual harassment.
"You know what I hate about the metoo movement. They will get away with anything and everything that is considered harassment when some of the things people do is Not even considered harassment.

Im sick in tired of the harassment card as well. Even looking at them in the eye...now they will think that is harassment."
Extremely sad to read the comments below.. ppl are making fun of her looks.. she is a person who wants to bring change in the society.. hats off Tarana.. we r with you..
"SANDRA BLAND DIDN'T GET A ME TOO SUPPORT , BLACK WOMEN BEING HARASSED BY POLICE DIDNT GET ME TOO ,"
"They don't care about me too. It's all about power, political power. It's so evident now that it's crazy how any Democrat still falls for their hypocrisy."
Keep on fighting the good fight! Thank you!
It is extremely sad for people to criticize someone who is trying to take a stand and do the right thing.How she looks or anyone else has nothing to do with someone abusing their power and taking advantage of people.  The harsh reality is the comments are a reflection of why people keep things a secret.. hypocrisy is real.....
Before we judge anyone in life take a long look into the mirror and ask yourself what Sins have I done in my lifetime!
"Did the cop accused of gripping and groping a woman's breast really have consent to do so ? Well, the public will always  decide ."
It’s a guy on the NACCP making money off this meet too movement shameless people . So this man taking pics with people who was actually charge and this man help him get off wow. So they pic and choose who they go after UNBELIEVABLE.
This woman is a rolemodel because she is no classic beauty but carries herself like one. I love that !!!
I feel it is sad when hear say from 30 years ago . Puts a end to justice. Use to be a person had to have evidence and was a statue of limitations. Also the women that really had something tremble happened to them and need the help . The gold digging women hurt them by making a mockery out of system and the true pain they Felt.
Most of the these actresses sold there bodies for movie roles. Thats all it really was an uncomfortable/regrettable moment in there lives.
How can you head the metoo movement when u a man
This movement is an embarrassment to all women widespread. Disgraceful.
"Afraid to read a lot of stupid and totally old-fashioned comments (mostly from prehistoric-minded men, not surprising) and most on Miss Burke's physical appearance, which shows a lack of consciousness and deep thinking...How sad !"
"I love when liberal journalists use the term ""grassroots"", like THEY are in that group. The ""grassroots"" people, which believe in protecting the American culture, are the working class people who voted for Trump. They want less immigrants as well as properly vetted immigrants."
It’s honestly sad how many people are being so rude and evil in the comments. She is a beautiful black woman who is strong enough to stand up for women.
These comments show the true direction this sinking ship called America is sadly headed.
Cory Feldman and Alysa Malano started it.
Now should start #not me movement
she got a jawbone on her
"What about Biden?
Me too is a sham"
Proud of Tarana!Keep speaking out!
"""Wa dada dang wa dada dada dang listen to my 9mm go bang!"""
Beautiful brave woman
"It be Fugly and will throw feces at you. Run fast, run far."
"The “me too” movement is an example of abuse of “female-gender-privilege”.

“Chivalry” or “female-gender-privilege” exists when women play into the role of female weakness for a given benefit.  As opposed to “male chauvinism”, it involves the active or passive signaling of female gender inferiority or weakness.

The abuse of the “me too” movement was evident when females started becoming “victims” in places males would not be considered victims.  If a woman flashed her chest to a male, the male would not be considered a victim, for example.  Nor would he be victim, for receiving an indecent proposal.

“Chivalry” has led to gender-bias in sentencing and has encouraged “hearsay only”  and “no evidence based” civil and criminal complaints against an entirely male population.

Ask a women catcalling only applies to below average/ugly men. Handsome/Rich men can catcall say the exact same thing the ugly guy said and it's 👍 ok.
May someone please tell me why you all think this woman lied to us?
Damn!!!  She's the face of the me too movement!!???
can anyone go to the police that were physically abused by a predator or is this only for women? im asking for a friend.
I can't imagine her being sexually harassed due to her face
Me too ? Yeah you wish.
Don't be fooled by tarana Burke face.
Wtf is that
"Wtf is wrong with those people, blame everyone else then themselves. biggest scam artists on this planet."
"Ma'am, you created a weapon that can be used because of personal dislike ."
"Of course, who would harass this girl :?"

"In socialist hell hole Sweden where I live we have a ”ministry of equality” that has 135 employees, out of whom 114 are women, not very equal I’d say."
Women never “out ran” men. They were put in an elevator while men were denied access and told to take the slippery stairs the women oiled up.
"She makes a point about therapy for men, but in my experience (I work in mental health), men get better when they're DOING something, rather than just talking about their feelings. So many young men are single, unemployed, depressed, and feel powerless. They need to be doing something in their lives they can be proud of."
"“Women kept running and men got left behind” is a completely erroneous way of putting it. Women have been propped up by government and DEI initiatives of some form or another. It’s not that women have outrun men. It’s that men have been systemically hindered while women have been boosted. And this is not just in terms of admissions and hiring, it’s a psychological operation as well that has taught men to step aside and encouraged them to be more like women."
"It’s not merely that women left men behind, we chose to reshape society to place and keep women ahead. This systematic female favoritism is in schooling, the legal system, workplaces, technological development, publishing, banking, politics, and the military."
it drives me a little nuts how tradesmen are considered uneducated and for that are unattractive to women.......all the utilities are 99% work done by men.......our hardwork is being taken for granted
"""Choose emotionally healthy girls.""

Ah, great advice. So you are saying be on the hunt for the unicorn."
"""Do not participate in the hookup culture""

Ah, another amazing advice. In 2025 virtually all dating is hookup culture.
Then around the age of 32-38 about 10% of women wake up and desperately try to get themselves pregnant after a lifetime of hedonism, dozens of hookups, STDs, getting demolished by emotional wrecking balls, and so on.
Again the advice is to search for the unicorn - very useful, thanks!"
"Ive been a therapist for 12 years, mostly working with men in addiction. They are denied access to their kids, have no highly paying job opportunities, and are told they are toxic.

"There’s also 1 billion subsidies that support women at the cost of men.

Saying psychoanalytic therapy is the only way to deal with mental health struggles is like saying that we only need oxycodone to manage disease. Simple fact is different therapies are useful for different things.
"ok right off the bat I have criticisms about some of the assumptions made here. the idea that more women go to college means that women got ahead and men are being left behind is a blanket statement that needs to be dug into more: are they going to useful degrees, or are they just accumulating tremendous student debt? what about trades? Are we just going to continue the elitist view that a tradesman is less than a university graduate, even if that graduate degree is in interpretive dance therapy? Also the idea that this adversarial attitude started with MeToo is basically the previous generation saying ""oh no, MY version of feminism wasn't adversarial, it's just this latest wave"" when in reality I see a lot of animosity in my parents' generation, stemming from this ideology that basically treats women as defective men. the adversarial attitude has been subtly pushed by media for decades now; think of the idiot dad trope. ""haha, this guy that provides for us on a single income is an idiot! laugh at him!"""
"i always marvel at how wrong these psychologists get these issues, she doesn't have a clue about boys and men."
"I loved her advice about dating ""Date emotionally healthy women.""  How do you find out if the woman is emotionally healthy ""Go out to dinner."" Ummnn...  That's definitely a chicken and egg thing.  Don't know if she's emotionally stable until you date her and yet you need to know if she's emotionally stable before you approach her and she screams her head off that you're going to do something bad to her."
"I gotta say as a man of 54, i can identify with all of this stuff much earlier than some people. I had a mother who was a ground floor feminist, and she built a view of women in our house that they were supposed to be on a pedestal, and that they don't do wrong. It actually made my brother and I are a little afraid of women or maybe insecure is a better way to put it. Fast forward to nineteen eighty three I watched that same mother cheat on my father and destroy her entire family for another man and leave the family. Can you imagine what that did to a kid's mind When he learned the true nature of women? It took me years to unravel that and sometimes I still have trouble with it and I'd be lying if I said it didn't affect my relations with women. In my life i've managed to bed 15 different women. But I have to say there is a little bit of a love hate relationship with them inside me and it all goes back to my mother and the subject that you're talking about here"
"Pro/Con of this episode: +) she acknowledges boys are in bad shape in current culture. -) she sees the only solution as therapy, the cause of this entire mess we are in. It nearly ALL leads south, no matter how well meaning the therapist and subject. Actions matter and need scientific/practical correction, thoughts/feelings are spiritual territory. These therapists are now the clergy. Mostly atheists teaching us how to handle our spiritual reality."
One false allegation was enough for me. Never again.
"As a single dad (widower) raising 6 boys under the age of 9, and also having raised 6 who are now young adults, this was a topic I looked forward to listening to. Being a boy dad is all I've known for my entire adult life. Before having kids I worked with early school-age kids in the public school system, mainly assigned to work with unhappy kids struggling to adjust to the school routine. All the kids I was assigned to work with were boys and all of them felt like they didn't belong in the public school community. In hindsight I can see that I wasn't assigned to those kids because the teachers and admin staff believed I was specially talented at helping them. They simply didn't like the boys or want to waste their own time on them so they used me to keep the boys out of their hair. I could see early on that public school is built like a family, but a thoroughly dysfunctional one that favours some of the kids and pathologizes/scapegoats the rest - the boys. 

When my boys reached school age I tried the public system for a few years and assumed that because of my experience in the system working with troubled kids I couldn't possibly run into any problems with my own kids at school. However, I soon saw my boys as miserable as the troubled kids I'd worked with years earlier. I pulled the boys and started homeschooling. Such an easy solution. They have no exposure to any media, entertainment, schooling or devices that constantly convey the message that boys are defective faulty beings who can only become ""good"" by being more girl-like. They are simply free to grow up as boys without any interference attempting to distort their nature. It's how all boys were permitted to grow up before the woke assault on boys.

I enjoyed the early segments and was in strong agreement with some of Erica's points. As the discussion continued I felt myself drifting further away from her position. It felt like she was mainly trying to sell therapy. Erica recognizes that boys are being pathologized but then she pathologizes the solution to this problem. In her view bad therapies and bad systems create the problems, but then creating new ""good"" therapies and systems can fix them. I agree with your view that if people stop trying to break boys in the first place, in part by fixating on the world of therapies and labels, we wouldn't have such a large problem of having to fix them. Erica suggests that therapy is the antidote to being poisoned by these toxic systems while you (and I too) simply say: ""how about we don't poison the boys in the first place - then we don't need to use the antidote either.

While I wanted to agree more with Erica I felt myself drifting further away from her position and couldn't put my finger on why I felt that way. Toward the end her mask slipped and it became clear. When she made the statement that she didn't trust parents to know what's best for their kids she lost me entirely. And it looked like she lost you too at that moment but you politely allowed the interview to wind down without too much push-back on that.

I thought that statement about the role of parents was ludicrous. For two hours we heard how deconstructionists have created the chaos we see now in our schools and culture. We heard how parents who turn themselves into non-parents by being selfish, narcissistic or by abdicating their parental responsibilities to other non-parents, are the problem. The best solution is for kids to have two solid parents, a mother and father. But then by stating that she has no faith in parents, and wants to replace that role with a Utopian system run by an enlightened class, she essentially admits that she's for the deconstruction of the family. There is no greater act of deconstruction than the dismantling or undermining of the family and parental roles. 

I finally could see then why I couldn't get on the same page with Erica, in spite of wanting to so much. She has spent her working life as a priestess in the church of psychology and may feel that as long as kids are treated by people in her anointed class they may be saved. All other systems, classes, and the family too, cannot be trusted to be as competent at doing what the anointed therapy class can do. This is typical confused progressive Marxist garbage. 

How does the therapy class decide what is good and healthy for kids if they don't trust the parents? They decide on their own without the parents? Isn't this the very problem we have right now with the promotion of all the gender delusions in our schools? It feels too much like the invention of a new religion with a new anointed priest class that has decided it knows what is ""true"" or ""right"", but can only work if it can destroy all the religions that came before it. Deconstructionism.

Erica totally lost me on this. It is not for a woke academic to decide what is true or right, nor will they ever be more in tune to the needs of kids, and more motivated to meet those needs to the best of their ability, than that child's own parents.

Though I headed into this agreeing with the early segments, and by the end had some strong disagreements, I liked listening to this interview, and your others too. Most of my days the only conversations I hear are with boys under the age of 9 so spending a couple hours every now and then listening to one of my people helps me get my bearings back.😁"
"All your talk is about ""what to change on boys""..... Are you joking ? not a word on girls have to change ?????"
"@50:10 Why does she say no in response to “building all of the things”?

Men literally built all of the things. 

Odd"
"7:33 I feel like nearly everything she has said up to this point has been different from what I feel and my experience. Maybe it’s just me.

I’m not angry that my sons might be left behind. I’m angry that people have created systems which punish and reward people based on immutable character characteristics.

She acts like this stuff happened in a vacuum. Women just sprinted past men because… They are just fast?   No. That’s not why men are upset. That’s not why women with sons are upset.

They are upset because 53% of all workers in the United States were forced to take mandatory DEI trainings.  They’re upset because society has been telling boys and men that they are inherently bad.  They are upset because of the demonization of males, opportunities have been given to females not based on the virtue of merit or character, but by the virtue of the junk between their legs and the idea that men are inherently bad.

That’s what people are upset about. They’re not upset about being out done.  Men are really good at understanding and taking place in a hierarchy.  People are upset that it hasn’t been fair.

And they are upset that this unfairness to do great harm to both sons and daughters and the future has been brought about by weaponizing people’s real empathy, but even more importantly, they’re upset that it has been done by corrupt people benefiting from just wanting to look/feel good and virtuous while being anything but.

But I think the things that she says after that point makes sense generally speaking.

I agree with most everything else she says, although I think I might phrase things differently, personally, that’s not something I think is particularly important"
"The ONLY reason women ""got ahead"" is there's a huge thumb on the scale.  Take your thumb off the scale.  See what happens."
"It’s interesting the female therapist asks for more men in her field to help boys yet by nature of a man coming into such a female-dominated industry, they have to accept Academic Post Modern notions which could be contrary to fostering Masculinity and discourages men being men and boys being boys. I don’t think you can have both. The game is rigged. So enjoy the scoreboard, ladies🤷🏻‍♂️ good luck to us all."
"Why do these podcasters/influencers/whatever keep bringing on women to talk about men's problems, especially these big names that always get it wrong?"
The guest loses credibility when she minimizes the impact of divorce on children and tries to claim that the problem is that we just don't divorce well enough. That's simply not true.
A yacht is cheaper than a divorce Bro. Go sailing. 😂
Women took on the male role of CEO but they refused to take in the role of provider.  That is the problem.
"I am the father of two boys. Happily, well adjusted, fearless, and successful. Because of sports, i was able to interact with many parents. One woman, Asian, made a very insightful and interesting comment. She said, ""This country hasn't figured out how to raise their boys.""  The comment was made in 2010. Our sons were in the 10th grade."
"Ex Army JAG here. 38:15 is spot on; in my Brigade during 2020-2021, 40% of allegations were proven to be false . There were NO consequences for the false reporting since Command did not want to ""deter"" anyone from reporting.  It destroyed the lives of those who were falsely accused since the Army's culture is ""guilty until proven innocent"" (i.e. getting flagged, removal from favorable actions due to investigation, promotions suspended, schools suspended, etc. you are just stuck in limbo until it's all over (which could be up to a year). Approaching and making the first move has extreme risk attached to it since that movement."
"No.  No quotas, and don't rebalance classrooms.  It's up to men to build an education system for boys that gives them the academic hard skills.  But it also must let them get out, take risks and exhaust themselves.  Women may never be interested in us again.  But we can still choose to be excellent.  And working together in male hierarchies to overcome challenges is one of our real strengths that we'd better leverage."
"Just removing quotas would solve the issue. Women didn’t knock it out of the park, you were granted special dispensation on an unprecedented level. That’s why we’re in a slow motion collapse in direct correlation to your empowerment. 

Stop weighted admissions and special initiatives. Stop intersectionality, and this will be a corrected situation. You won’t though, too arrogant and secretly afraid."
Don’t listen to everything they are saying. Making the first move and she flips out is a very dangerous situation for the boy and must be avoided.
Men and modern women are not compatible.
"Women select, men struggle and compete to be selected. It's just men trying to navigate the social expectations that women impose. Men don't get to decide what those expectations are. We're never allowed to ask questions about women's expectations or their contribution to the given cultural arrangement, so there's just no solution. I don't know what to tell you."
"When John Papola talked about his son saying ""you don't know what it's like..."", his son was describing how he will be called out, judged and possibly ""shamed"" for ""making a move"" and most importantly, the mocking, shaming and judging  that will come form both men and women  if/when he gets rejected from making a move in the first place.
This is something that seriously needs to be discussed."
"They are not ""hating"" the ladies. They are demanding recompense and fair treatment. As they.should."
"I think the whole ""I won't even try to ask out that woman because she'll reject me anyways"" is so common in Gen Z."
"We don't have the issue that women kept running and men got left behind. Men were told we have to not only let women win. But we have to do the running for them. Round all the edges of competition. Blunt the sharpness of progress, and Tell men if they aren't willing to allow women to claim success during failure it is putting women down to make them feel inadequate. While not caring how hard men and boys try. They either produce or they are worthless. And telling boys the lies we tell girls don't work. Because that lie isn't enforced in the real world like it is for women and girls."
She lost me on the quotas.  DEI - gender version.  Hard pass.
12 minutes in and already this lady has no idea about boys.
The answer is “more top down social control”?
"She keeps on saying ""that girl is not a mentally healthy girl"". Yes, we are aware of that but it's not going to protect the boy from the charge of rape destroying his life. She really needs to be more practical in terms of her advice. How do you identify mentally unhealthy people, because I struggle to do that at the age of 60 ?"
"Some questions. 

1: Given that so many modern women wake up angry and consider anger a source of power, I am curious about why they think male anger is so inappropriate. 

2: Boys and men are subjected to injustice, they are not treated fairly, rules are often tilted in girl's favour, I'd  like to know which other emotion is more appropriate than anger?

3: Do these people realise how unpleasant, joyless and exploitative the experience of dating modern women can be for the average man?

4: Do they understand just how pointless it is trying to date women who often have standards for men that gods cannot meet? 

5: Why do they expect men to meekly go back to a marriage model that even they know is totally broken, abused for personal gain, highly destructive and toxic to the family unit men are expected to build and protect?

6: It's true that a few men are angry at women, it's also true that huge numbers of men just find these women unattractive and this gets reclassified as anger, not disinterest, despite all the evidence that men are not pursuing certain types of women in the numbers that those women expect. Why aren't they seeing this?"
I like most of what this woman guest is saying except for the part that therapy is the answer for everything. Sounds a little self-serving. Especially for young men therapy is definitely not the answer. Mentorship from other men is what is the answer a young boy needs other men around him to figure out how to be a man.
There’s a program being introduced in UK schools to  combat misogyny in men and boys. I’d like to know how that’s going to help. It’s going to make men retreat from society even more . Doubling down with feminist misandry isn’t going to be taken well by men and boys.
"Boys being held back, but why? And by who and what mechanisms? Asking questions like these gets you quickly labeled as an “ist” or “phobe”. The sad part is, when you try to explain this to someone (especially a woman) they often don’t see a problem with it."
"Vehemently disagree with you on Family court catastrophising.  I've been through it and fought only for my kids with a severely mentally I'll mother making every false allegation under the sun and they still awarded custody to her and my kids now no-longer speak to either of us.  The fact that the Court would not apply simple decency and consequences for her terrible behavior AND the fact that my experience is demonstrably and consistently repeated through the Wester world, shows a genuine lack of empathy and seriousness about re-promoting marriage."
"Calling boys “fragile” implies a kind of inherent weakness or instability—like they break easily and need protecting.

But “reactive” is far more accurate and balanced. It describes a response style, not a flaw. It means boys might be more sensitive to stimuli, social dynamics, or emotional triggers, but it doesn’t frame them as weak—it frames them as more responsive to their environment. That can look like withdrawal, intensity, impulsivity, or hyper-awareness—not fragility.

And here’s something important:

Yes, biologically, boys are less resilient in early childhood. That’s not a flaw—it’s genetics. With only one X chromosome, they’re more vulnerable to developmental issues, neurological disorders, and complications early in life. Even into adulthood, women show greater resilience to disease and illness, while men tend to have greater resistance to physical trauma and injury.

That’s not opinion—that’s the biological tradeoff.

But it’s often misunderstood or misused.


The reason “fragile” gets used more often could be because:

1. Psychoanalytic language leans emotive – It’s trying to evoke compassion, but sometimes ends up sounding pathologizing.


2. There’s a cultural undercurrent of framing boys’ mental health through dysfunction or crisis, rather than development or adaptability.


3. “Fragile” supports a caretaking narrative—but at the cost of seeing boys as fundamentally broken, instead of complex and reactive to unmet needs, stress, or chaotic environments.

“Reactive” opens the door to deeper questions:

What are boys reacting to?
What expectations shape their expression?
What gets repressed or misunderstood?
What kind of support builds better responses?

She tries to point out bias narratives but then instinctively chooses not to reframe unfair narratives— id rather not to deny struggle, but to understand it and make room for strength"
I liked the point about female superheroes being a copy and paste of their male counterparts. Made me think of why the titular character Nausicaa from the valley of the wind is so well written. She's the female ideal. She's a strong caring leader that inspires men though her refined feminine qualities.
It is fascinating watching this once great society come unraveled. What a time to be alive!
"When I was growing up in the late ‘80s and into the ‘90s, there were so many boys being placed on Ritalin. I didn’t have ADD; I was dealing with anxiety and a lack of interest in some of the topics we were covering. That problem has only become worse since then, unfortunately."
"""Make sure, if who you're dating is mentally healthy!"", is the quote of the century!!!!!!💪"
"The moment she said women were disempowered at some point in history so it was a good thing we empowered them, this tells me she believes the feminist revisionist history.

I would push back and question, were women actually disempowered? Or did they have all the power they needed to be women and they just weren’t satisfied with just being women?"
Feminist movement “A little misdirected???” Are u kidding 😂😂😂#denial #NOSCCOUNTABILITY
I agree with so much of what this woman says but therapy is not the solution. You can’t train therapists that will help with the current schools. Therapy programs are pumping out terrible therapists. She seems to have no idea of how bad the current schools are when it comes to training therapists. I got my masters in clinical mental health and did not learn anything of value
"Christianity is the only religion that teaches other-centered behavior. And equality in marriage. That is what has changed in our society. Everyone is narcissistic in relationships. Never what we can do for our spouse, but what they can do for us."
"Being a therapist doesn't mean she's not a woman.
Caring about women and women's issues doesn't mean one can't reject feminism. Those two things aren't synonymous."
"I saw a therapist tell the Dad Saves America guy that men need to look for women who are emotionally healthy, that aren’t “paranoid and persecuted”, and that aren’t afraid of their feminine side. I would say the same goes for guys…I had to learn this myself back when I came of age in the 90s and 00s, that a man needs to not be afraid of his masculine side too—he has to have those good male qualities that give him confidence and conviction that avoids him falling into “nice guy syndrome”, like you were saying. Men are at their best when they’re kind, but being nice is not a good place to be because you aren’t in touch with your masculinity enough to say no when you need to, or to express any negative emotions in healthy and appropriate ways. So there are plenty of messed up women and men alike, and both can work on themselves to improve, and they must also work on their ability to identify the emotionally broken people and the emotionally well people, and deal with their issues so that they are not attracted to the emotionally unstable persecuted or mean people who just bring chaos into people’s lives. And above all, men and women both gotta stop jumping on each other right away because sex makes all of this a million times more difficult…you’ve basically bonded yourself to someone before you’ve evaluated whether you should bond yourself to them."
"31:00 it's the progressive ideology, the same ideology that did the french revolution, and the soviet revolution, just read their books, read brave new world, this was the objective from the beginning."
"What Erica explains at 10:05 is important to explain why girls & boys should be separated early in education. I’ve worked with young kids, little boys are more physical due to testosterone & need more physical playtime so they are able to focus better when learning."
Tradesmen used to be respected and provided a very good quality of life...they've been utterly broken and disregarded....it's not only at levels of university or college
15:53 My friend pulled her son out of Kindergarten because he was so stressed out by all the standardized testing. She home schooled him all the way through. He graduated this year.
"That’s why we don’t commit anymore.  We work all day to come home to problems. Women today have the expectation that they will be a stay at home wife and the man is still supposed to work all day, pay her way through life, then come home cook, clean, and serve her because other single women on the internet deluded her into thinking that she’s a 10 when she’s a solid 4 on her best day.  Occasionally getting laid isnt worth all the problems, bills and stress"
"Erica seems very knowledgable and intelligent.  It's troubling to hear her speak of government as if it's an entity that has a role to play.  Government is nothing more that millions of individuals (many corrupted and perverse) claiming authority (illegitimate in most cases), and credibility (unwarranted in most cases).  One does not have to be a libertarian to recognize this.  What it does require is for parents, and society to take responsibility and stop wanting someone else to take care of them.  One could argue that part of why we face so many crisis in society results from a mindset of needing to be protected or taken care of (female/infantile trait?) by somebody or something else.  It's one thing to voluntarily take in information, or to take advantage of aligned resources, but it's completely unacceptable to claim authority to dictate.  I find Ericas assertion that individuals in government have the legitimate authority to tell me what I or my children can consume, and at what age.  It's this Erica mindset that delivers us into authoritarianism, and tyranny.  Good intentions or not, she is deranged and delusional, and this is precisely the sort of people we need to prevent from having power."
"Here is your problem - your understanding of hook-up culture and situationships. Hook-up culture and situationships are for successful men, not for the normal guy. A guy with choice will have women stay in situationships since committing to one girl would be a bad choice for him. If you are a woman, and you feel like the guy isn't committing to you, and you describe your relationship as situationship, it's most likely because you are swinging beyond your league. That guy won't ever commit, you are very likely his side-chick and not much more."
This is all good news for handymen.  Lots and lots of women living alone that need things fixed. Men suddenly have value when the kitchen sink is clogged.
"The advice she's giving here should be directed 100% towards the women: as they decide everything right from the onset of who to ""take to dinner."" 
Men have 0 agency in the decisions women choose or not choose to make."
"51:43
Yeah.  Youve seen the result of men having their space, and over 30+ years wahmen have destroyed every single one of them."
"Some men told us we have to work on us but we never heard someone told a woman you have to work on you, so they take pity and blame other, the government funds women, forced women to run and tight us on a chair by blaming us to warch the run. And women comes to spit on our face to not get on her standards and men we have to accept that behavior. Why men are divided to not support each other , level up together and help each other"
"..and water is wet. how is it that I have been aware of all this for twenty years. Books, articles lecture, intellectuals, they have all be sounding the alarm, screaming in to the void. At this point, these conversations are interesting and I wish Erica the best, but at some point I think it is safe to say that society considers men disposable, men had the upper hand for a long time and now that they're down there seems to be some sadistic enjoyment from people with influence, bottom line nothing is going to change becuase nobody gives a shit. 
All of society, ""There's a problem with X group, lets fix X by supporting, creating programs, changing the systems to help the marginalised class, give money to fix it"".. 
All of society towards men, ""What is wrong with you? Why don't you pick yourself up by your bootstraps? Don't be a loser. Sit down, shut up, take this pill and get on with it""
Yes, it is all broken on all levels, not just school and frankly nothing will change becuase at the root of it men are disposable and nobody gives a shit about men except for mothers who care for their sons and that just doesn't cut it."
Men do well in groups... (First rule: We don't talk about Fight Club)

"""Bad Dating advice for young men""   I watched Rocky with my son and daughter when they were older teenagers. The scene where Rocky stops Adrianne from leaving the apartment by putting his arm across the door was one of the most romantic scenes of the 80's. He loves her, she loves him, but she wanted to leave because of her own fear and insecurity. He pushed her boundaries, they fell in love and that became the main story line.  Both my kids felt he had crossed the line, and called it assault and ""kidnapping.""  He had no intention of hurting her but knew she had to get out of her ""comfort zone"" and move forward.  That scene is integral to the movie. Nowadays there would have been no boxing match as Rocky would have been incarcerated that night. Sad that youth cannot see that. And sad that women are seen as victims in every situation."
The thesis statement of the guest is obnoxious.
"To any guy feeling down about not being able to get involved with a woman, very very few are anything close to relationship material in 2025."
"The industry that I trained for routinely has networking events for exclusively women, non binary people, lbtq+ people, non white people. I’ve never seen a networking event exclusively for white strait men, not saying that we need it; I’d personally prefer if there was no networking events based on identity, but even in the events that include my identity I feel looked over or outright rejected. Maybe that’s internalized self hatred I’ve developed in my 24 years of living, but goddamn does it feel impossible to be a punching bag anymore especially when the product of a majority of larger companies are outright failing. It feels like I wasn’t given the opportunity, and on top of that the people that where are destroying the future opportunities I could have had."
"She fails (or refuses) to touch on the point of how extremely hateful women have become towards men. Especially online. Why would you even bother if, for the past 20 years, you've heard almost nothing but hateful things about yourself?"
"Because of YT censorship there's no way that I or anyone else can actually tell you what you missed, the half truths and the whole lies that were told and I personally am not even allowed to post more than one sentence any more."
Time for men and boys to say no.  Stop government harrassment or persection under Title IX.  Girls and women are stand up to Title IX persecution for speaking up for fair competition and safety from trans in female sports.
School was hell 30 yrs ago. Bet not much has changed. The army was less violent
Men got left behind or held back???
"It has affected all men. I don’t ever talk to women at work after metoo. And arms length in personal relationships. Being in entertainment, seeing how destructive that pendulum swung as to weaponize women against men, I’m forever changed. Nothing that swings the other way will ever make me trust interaction again. I feel VERY sorry for young boys that went through this."
Has anyone ever seen an emotionally and mental balanced woman? 😂
Feminism gained unstoppable power through a sisterhood and all for one and one for all mentality. That shows no signs of abating.
"It's sad to see some women using this beautiful movement to spread their hatred against men. I'm a woman and I do not support that because I have a brother, I have incredible male friends and I'll have a husband someday and they mean to me."
I think they should apologize to Johnny after falsely accusing him of DA without a single proof and believing Amber without even trying to see if she was actually lying or not.
Isn’t it ironic that a woman who is talking about sexual violence is met with objectification and demeaning by men and women alike about her looks. #disgusting
"I’m right-leaning and currently doing research critique on MeToo and modern feminism. There is a ton of hypocrisy and logical inconsistencies in the movements.

 Nonetheless, I think the mean comments here cross the line. I hope we maintain a respectful debate of ideologies instead of becoming what we hate."
Its really too bad this movement was infested with idiots and liars claiming to be victims even though  they aren't.
It's hard to believed that this woman has been sexually harrased
So this is the lady that caused all this hatred against men and brought us to this point.
"i sense this woman has experienced plenty of trauma growing up, its a great shame she seems like a powerful and confident woman today."
Amber Heard has made a mockerey of this movement.
"I fully support the me too movement, but more should be done to vet some of these claims, before blind support is given.  As a survivor of  physical and mental abuse by my ex wife for the 6 years of my marriage, I was the one who was being accused in court. Some women will use an organization such as this to benefit themselves in such matters as divorce or custody."
"I feel sorry for the ones commenting about her nose and how she came up with me too because a man refused to sleep with her. 
Lord I’m sorry man I hope y’all get well soon. 
Your mentality needs some serious help, I hope y’all get it."
She's definitely beautiful inside out and brave which matters the most than the ppl who are commenting the way she looks ..its ridiculous to see hate comments!
"This is sad to see people comment more on how she look like rather than the video itself, those guys who comment about her look probably look ugly 😐"
"I think the Me Too movement is doing a great job by helping survivors of sexual violence see that they are not alone and at the same time this movement helps to improve awareness about how wide is sexual violence and the importance we should put into this topic. Sexual violence is a serious problem that affects the victim for the rest of their lives and this movement tries to help the victim to overcome the situation through empathy and by not letting them stand alone, they encourage the victim to tell their stories and not be ashamed. For me this is a great way to help someone that suffered from this, to keep going and when they tell their stories it helps for other people to understand how serious is this problematic. This problem can't be eradicated so easily but we should start with ourselves, to take action in talking about the subject in order to create an understanding of this."
Me Too does not attack all men! What does do is Call out Men who use their status against women using sex in the Work Place! It’s not just in upper society! There are lots of Bosses  and Religious Figures who force sex on the unwilling and vulnerable taking advantage of their need for a merger job.
Peoples comments are genuinely disgraceful please keep your discriminating comments to yourself 👋🏼
I just read your book and I am in awe of you sis! Thank you for using your voice and reclaiming your work🙏🏽❤️
This woman has  N   O   S   T   R   I   L   S.
I’m wondering if the me to movement will be going over to Afghanistan to help the women over there? Just asked a question
"Friendly reminder that this is now pointless, the movement died"
This need to include young boys to when grown women sexual assault and have a baby. For some reason women think boys don’t get molested and think this is how to interact with females. Them same boys grow up to be men and the cycle continue because they don’t know right from wrong when nobody help them from a grown person.
"Did not talk about, how the movement is being misused."
Who's here because of Amber heard?
Thank the CEO for destroying relationships
She looks like a background character in a Star Wars movie
This is why the Chad's Ray Ray and Tyrone's don't want to approach the women anymore.
"Why people hated this tho, if you are not some Bill Cosby type of guy this is not gonna affect you"
This happens to both genders.
Me too is a movement that persecutes men. He does not seek justice. You are inquisition.. Johnny Deep 🌹
Very informative!!!! on the side not - the video and background music are giving out different energies.
Unpopular opinion: white Women ruined the me too movement
"What about those of us men who were and are targeted by predators who are seasoned in what they do, act as a collective and in my case, working in tandem with racist to vilify, demonize, and criminalize my character and credibility? Any up to date videos on the hell black straight men go through in a workplace?"
These comments are cancerous.

This WILL back fire. Not only does this follow a man for the rest of his life, this will also follow the accusers (woman) for the rest of their lives also. Woman, Good Luck with that promotion, new job, or even finding a date. The Me Too movement is woman's custom designed kryptonite, and loneliness is your end game.
Also, the fact that the accusers names are never revealed, but the accused is executed on the spot, without any investigations, shows us the justice system is run by a woman, and the news reporters should be locked up for reporting on this before due process has been played out. The networks will be sued like never before. And i am looking forward to it.
Relax guys, revenge is coming. The world will find out about these Yoga Pants wearing hair bun sporting couch crushing face book war-shippers, that cant cook, clean house or do anything really, except be angry at the world because nothing fits anymore. 
I'm sure if we tried a little, all kinds of dirt will be found out about these so called victims. And it probably wont be necessary to go back years in the past. The females are cornering themselves into complete rejection. The accusers will forever carry the tag of finger pointer. Because of it, they will become unemployed, nobody will hire them, and become very lonely cause they cant go into public anymore. Only to avoid offending the woman. They offend themselves every time they look in a mirror. So enjoy your yoga pants, and renew your netflix subscription and get an extra large bag of oreo's so you can continue binge watching the walking dead, because that is the future the woman have created for themselves. LMAO ""Me Too"" will change .....
I wear Yoga Pants because nothing else fits...... Me Too
My home is a mess.... Me Too
I cant cook but I can reheat..... Me too
I cant stop binge watching netflix..... Me too.
I can destroy a box of cookies in one sitting...... Me Too
I can crush a couch in one sitting.... Me Too
I cant keep a man happy.... Me too
The bigger I get, the meaner I get... Me Too
No man will even look at me now because of the ME TOO movement..... Me too"
"When a movement results in the infringement of the rights of others, in terms of DUE PROCESS, it should NEVER be allowed in the court system. If MSM continues to support unprovable accusations, then THEY should be held liable. Part of being an ADULT, is TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS, which means not putting yourself in a position when and where abuse may occur. Sexual abuse has been around since the beginning of time so you can't claim ignorance, but you might be able to blame your mother for not raising you with any common sense. You'd have to be born, and raised, under a rock not to know that at the forefront of the majority of these abusive environments is in the entertainment industry. Any idiot knows that. But apparently we're having an IDIOT epidemic right now. If the roles were reversed and you had to PROVE your innocence...could you? Think about it...although thinking really isn't your strong suit, is it?"
"Me too.

I was at the train and it was crowded.
I stood there because there wasn't any seat available.
So this woman came forward and cupped my gentiles. She was impressed as her facial expression showed  🥹  but that is not 😡.
She then went and reported me for letting her cup my gentiles. How on earth I could have guessed what she was about to do as she came close. I was stuck in between many people standing in the train carriage.
For this reason, I say me too."
She didn't start it though. She literally started a movement based off OTHER people starting the complaints. She banked off celebrity women. She is disgraceful to me
Me too and femenism in general is a joke !
I watched your video defending amber while you condemned Johnny that was so bad of you .
So many positives and many negatives about this movement. My family just happens to be going through the negative portion of it. My step son's ex girlfriend and her family of white trash called sexual assault with a knife against him and he is only 14. We know he didn't do this and CAS has background on this family in them with sexual assault and such. This girl has cut herself in our bathroom on her leg and a month after the breakup she does this bullshit and now our son will never get into the army and get a job anywhere. He won't be able to travel again. Doesn't matter if it is proved he didn't do it. The charge will forever be on his record.
Where is the movement for the children
who the fuck would sexually harass that thing
Trump  👍👍👍
Rewind 2018: MeToo Movement
⁠y’all keep talking about her appearance. Predators don’t care what a victim looks like . It’s about power. I’m positive she has experienced a lot of trauma throughout her life due to her looks alone. Someone probably did it with the same mindset of “who’d believe that someone would S.A. you?” Which would make them get away with it. That’s a messed up feeling.
Anything associated with a movement usually smells foul and should be flushed away from society....
"Why are the only people not being asked to take responsibility the ones who are claiming to be victims? Do the woman have NO responsibility at all? LET ME BE CLEAR. I am absolutely NOT talking about victim blaming. Nor am I saying that any kind of assault / bullying / intimidation can ever be right. And I certainly admire the lady in this video. SHE did what should have been done years ago.

 However, the ""casting couch"" is not a new phenomena, it was first spoken about in 1937!!! Over 80 years ago! So any young woman who wanted to be a famous actress was aware of this existing phenomenon. (Again NOT saying that made it right. Just made it a fact) If they were young then we can absolutely understand their making the foolish decision to submit to it - but did none of them have parents / guardians / older people to stand up for them? 
More importantly, where were the now famous actresses  who went before these modern victims in the decades in between?
What I find sickening, not praiseworthy, is these now incredibly famous POWERFUL women are standing up as heroes of the MeToo movement. Why Merrill did you not speak up IMMEDIATELY when you were famous enough to do something? (I remember you from Kramer v Kramer in 1979  so you have had decades to change things.)You saw all these young women coming after you, decade after decade, and you kept SILENT. You have had 40 years of fame and fortune where you have not had to worry about your career being damaged by speaking out about the corruption in your industry. And yet until now, you did nothing, said nothing.
And now we are supposed to praise you for speaking up? As someone once famously said, “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”"
What man in his right mind would come on to this woman? Or perhaps she was just seeking attention.
Where are you now about what happened on Oct. 7 ‘23 & the hostages that have been taken. Or is that not popular to stand for them with all the antisemitism?
"In particular, black and brown girls.  Because they're obviously more important."
It's not a sexual assault if the women takes 10 to 20 years to come out and say it
worst trend of 2017
"UN Women, Democratic Women’s Caucus, Me Too, Emilys Liste,  AAU, WHO, I Stand With Her, and many, many more. Have you no shame? Where are you???"
"Sexual violence includes people sending their target unwanted explicit pictures, dropping their pants while mooning people in person; yelling at them in public while swearing at them only because they are not looking down at the ground all of the time only; opening packages not addressed to them when seeing a package with their name on it, using developer tools before getting permission to offer special effects while using messenger to contact them; stealing whole sentences and paragraphs from them while looking for dirt on them; etc. etc. etc. Just because some people in that kind of crowd are famous when not doing things like that nearly as often does not mean they are any less repsonsible for participating in that kind of harrasement called gang stalking."
I have a question what is worse MeToo or Black Lives Matter
"Where was the me- too movement when this Leah ""biological male"" Thomas broke all the women's"
Metoo is an popularity contest
Your 👃kinda wild
what happened to her face tho
I feel like she is mad because nobody wants her. And the people that she likes don’t like her back
A wise man once said : There is something worse than death it’s called bad woman.
Oh boy an assignment on the Me Too movement. I hope the comments will help me in conjunction with the video. :clueless:
"Thank you very much for all of your time and tear for all of this and I appreciate everything that you have done and are doing and if I can be of any help just let me know, I certainly understand this beyond words! I had many testimonies to help others& anyone that Heavenly Father puts in my path🙏☝️✌❤  I give heartfelt thanks to our heavenly father☝️ in the precious name of  his son Jesus ☝️may the  gifts of the Holy Spirit  be felt every day, in every breath we take, with positive peace, that passes all understanding! in the name of Jesus,  ..I pray amen and amen!🙏☝️✌✌❤❤☝️❤🙏"
Im black and damnnnnnnn her nose is big as hellll
Just imagine to meet this one where it’s day light ( usually it’s dark alley to be affraid of) in her case day light it’s her enemy.
"I understand what this movement was supposedly “intended” to be but it’s just turned into a weapon designed to destroy men at will and we’re seeing this play out right now in the dating scene because if men so happen to reach out to women or look at them a particular way, she could cry wolf and that right there is absolutely dangerous!"
KRS-1
"so sexual violence is a very widespread issue that affects lots of females and women do they know 'where' it is coming from, any like 'specific origin' or is it widespread across all genders and backgrounds? 'who' is 'targeting' 'who' in this widespread issue of sexual violence? "
I dont have no problem with the movement  but the meme with the virgin mary is disgusting and blaspheming.
I'm dreaming about being a blunt.... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They turn it into something horrible
So rkelly hit 🤔🤔
So it's still a competition between the races even in matters of sexual violence? I thought sexual violence was bad irrespective of race or gender.
What an ungodly sighting.
"I will not drink so much, bro/"
Remember TARA...
the reason why romance is dead making me look bad as a man now as someone who is single af since birth i feel hopeless
Good LAWD....no comment
I’m glad they let men join to
Free my nigga cill bosby
"heard about this movement (by accident) through led zeppelin. never heard if it, b4. had 2 examine a separate video 2 see what it was"
Guys ; ease up on the Burke; no wonder these #metoo women are getting nasty;
So tell me when are you guys going to apologize on camera in front of the whole world and say sorry to Johnny Depp for what you have done and how Amber heard should not be at spoke person for you people I feel sorry for you this is for sure but wrong was done you guys know a wrong was done So it's time to swallow your pride and apologize to Johnny Depp. And never ever use Amber heard for a spokesperson for me to movement. So make your apology to all the big television studios down there in the States so everybody in the world can see it if you don't think you are a hypocrite.
To the dude that violated the founder of this poathetic movement: get some fvcking glasses my guy!
"Anybody In The World: Exists and does literally nothing.

The MeToo Movement: How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man?!

The MeToo Movement in a nutshell."
"Movement for Black and Brown girls, but I guess she paid for that picture with all the white girls 100%. Looks better. Smart."
Alot of these men are innocent I think. It's women living provocative lifestyles and buyer's remorse I think. It's a fad like any other
She wanted to do something gr8...it went downhill pretty bad huh
"She looks like a female version of Shrek, only NOT green.  Will youtube ban me if I say ""black""?"
Shame it was abused nd used as a power trip for some woman to spread there personal hatred towards men
She didn’t found the Me Too movement!
"Eeew, not me!!!!"
SOOOO BIG
"""The road to hell is paved with good intentions"""
When are you going to address the blatant sexual violence and womanizing found in almost EVERY RAP SONG?
Me too.
Damn that the biggest nose i eva seen
Believe all women because they said so 🤬 this is a cry wolf scenario waiting to happen in fact it's already happened. Any woman that falsely accuses a man of rape is screwing over the actual victims. Possibly the most selfish thing you could ever do it really comes down to the fact that they just don't like a certain guy or you don't like men so they want to create false allegations
This why charlamagne tha god changed his ways lol
Why is me too movement not doing anything about the 1000s Uber and Lyft drivers accusations of raping of adults and underage girls. Of their customers
"Je suis un HOMME. J'ais vu des jeune filles se faire harceler trois fois par des jeunes HOMMES. Ils passaient en voiture en disant qu'elles étaient bonnes. Une autre fois, dans le tramway, heureusement elles ne se sont pas laissées faire.... Je me demande si ces jeunes ont fait leurs éducations sexuel en regardant des films pornographiques très très jeunes avec leurs portables payés par leurs parents?   Les relations entre filles et garçons se sont dégradés..... Dans ma jeunesse on avait un  meilleure rapport avec les filles.   On avait encore notre innocence à 15/16 ans....On prenait notre temps pour se connaître.....Les jeux de séduction étaient maladroit, on était un peux gauche, mais on ne franchait pas les limites....On s'envoyait des petits mots ou un entremetteur rapportait les lettres ou les petits mots d'amour.   En fait la drague se faisait dans la douceur.....J'espère que ça existe toujours....Les filles deviennent un peux moins féminines qu'à mon époque. Je pense que c'est aussi une façon de se protéger.....C'est triste."
Heureusement qu'elles sont toujours flinguer pas de grosse perte pour nous ahahaha
"A man and a woman having an intelligent discussion on modern problems, there's still hope for humanity!"
So refreshing to see “Jordan Peterson on me too” rather than “Jordan Peterson DESTROYS me too”
"Two minutes in, and I could see this woman was going to have an INTELLIGENT conversation instead of ""gotcha""."
It’s sad that all the comments are praising her for being reasonable because we’ve gotten so used to unreasonable behaviour and steering conversation away from reality
Respect to this lady for actually listening to him and asking him what certain things mean. This lady is awesome cause she's open minded.
Look at all the love she gets just for listening and having a rational discussion... See how easy it is?
"I really like this lady. Idk who she is, I bumped into this video by chance but she seems so genuinely interested but also highly educated and well spoken. It is just so nice to hear a calm conversation about charged topics."
"I like this woman. She's good, she listens and adds to the debate. I like her."
A couple of very intelligent Canadians have a very reasonable discussion.
"Blatchford passed away today.
Peterson is fighting for his life in Russia.

This video is more important today than ever."
"My favprite thing about this conversation is how damn relaxed both of them are. Dr. Peterson is literally laid-back, sipping coffee, arms open and just enjoying a reasonable chat with another person, instead of buttoned up and ready to defend himself from any angle of attack. What a diference from many other interviews."
"It's so oddly refreshing to hear JP have an actual discussion with a woman who actually listens, behaves fairly rationally and seeks to reach a common understanding through their conversation."
"Thank you dear lady to ACTUALLY letting him speak and answer your questions for truth’s sake, not your feelings. THAT is a real journalist. THANK YOU!"
I could tell from the first 10 seconds that I was going to like this woman. She was visibly calm and genuinely LISTENING to JP.
"""Having never had the fortune to spend time in an Iranian prison, they're not very good at distinguishing what constitutes a tyranny and a free society""! LOL Yep! he's quite right, unfortunately!"
Holy shit. An interviewer that asks relevant and non-abrasive questions? Must be Canadian.
Good on Christie Blatchford for being one of the few columnists to conduct a proper interview with Peterson. May her efforts and mode of conduct bear fruit that allows her to move up the ranks!
"Christie Blatchford is a great Journalist. One of the few ""Good Reads"" left in Canada. She gets it!"
"Peterson is a cool guy with a distinctly rational way of looking at things. It's refreshing, we need him. But can't help thinking that many people reading/watching him just mindlessly agree with everything he says because he is a ""genius"". And I'm sure not even JP himself wants that."
Anyone else fascinated with how pretty the rainbow books are? Really really nice background.
You know the world has gone to hell when it’s rare to see a civil conversation like this
RIP Christie Blatchford we lost a true warrior and great human being.
Jordan is such a breath of fresh air! Making sense of difficult topics
"The final piece here rings so true. As an educator, I have three cameras in my room at all times, one in my office with a 360 ceiling view and two in the classroom. Everything is there. The trust between myself and my students has always been there, but I'm covering my own rearside just in case."
the part where he mentioned you can't divorce sexuality from everything and being central hits home.. this is what's wrong with current days.. people not taking responsibility of anything.
"Finally, Jordan is interviewed by an intelligent person and not one of Jim Henson's Muppets."
Metoo started out going after real offensive serial abusers and evolved into complaints about bad dates.
Now this is a conversation. This is how we should be discussing these subjects or subjects in general.
"These two are a breath of fresh air, a welcome oasis of intelligence & reason in a chaotic, mad and maddening world"
I like her
Watching the way this woman listened and had a genuine conversation to explore a powerful topic was refreshing and beautiful to witness.
"FINALLY! Someone who actually listens.. WOW, what a completely different interview when a recipient ""ACTUALLY"" listen!!!"
"im persian and i've spent time in an iranian prison, and i've lived here all of my 20 years... all i've ever wanted for myself and my people has been western laws that grant individual liberties, and to think you have a generation hell bent on eradicating that seems immeasurably moronic"
"Listening to his interviews is so comforting, feels like there's still some sanity somewhere in this world."
An interviewer who isn’t trying to demean and corner him?! She is actually having a conversation.
"There such a huge divorce between how people practically behave day-to-day and what people want to claim the 'rules' are. I've been hit on, not a million times, but it's happened, by men and women. Pretty much every time, the offer involved an initiation of physical contact. It's called 'making a move', we all know what that is, or at least we used to (It doesn't mean I got grabbed in my special place, it's usually a hand on a leg or something like that). It takes courage, and doesn't always go well. Sure, it wasn't always welcome on my side, particularly from another guy, but how petty and small of me to call it harassment, let alone sexual assault. If you live in reality, go to bars and clubs with horny drunk people looking for love, sometimes this will happen. That's life and being human, and to my mind not a particularly big deal. But suddenly, we lump those people under sexual assaulters, ruin their lives, and make it so people in general become afraid to engage in natural human interaction. All because a few idealists and young people thought they could define human behavior in two sentences of 'right' and 'wrong' based on their own desire to be free from having to ever deal with anything they didn't want to."
"it feels so good to watch and listen to a conversation between two intelligent people that are not out to get the other, but to exchange ideas on the basis of respect"
"This is honestly one of the most captivating interviews I’ve ever seen. The interviewer was the epitome of a professional and, as always, Jordan Peterson did a fantastic job explaining the impetus for “sexual misconduct.”"
RIP Christie Blatchford. Not many like her left around.
This is a great discussion of two educated people sharing ideas and learning how to move forward through this societal issue
“Never have a meeting with a woman with the door closed “ this is our progress in 2020 !!
It's so refreshing to hear JP interviewed by someone who isn't trying to constantly attack him.
Love that lady! Thank you for let us listen without interruption
"It's so refreshing to see someone discuss with Jordan Peterson in a rational manner, creating a proper, civilized and intellectual discussion."
My main takeaway from this video is that the light purple book in the background has to go. It’s throwing off that colour gradient. I’m not actually sure what happened in this video as I couldn’t concentrate on anything other than that damn book. 😂
Christie is such a classy interviewer! She truly wants to hear his answers and engages brilliantly. 👌🤩
"He is always spot on during interviews. She was an excellent speaker as well. Most women jump to the feminism, and all the rest of the negative bandwagons. 
It's a scary world for a man. Why are women making it that way? It's a shame."
"The fact that this person even took the time to NOT interrupt him all the time, let him talk, have meaningful questions, allow for intellectual dissent between them... I know this was going to be good. I love this type of discourse."
Amazing Woman! She is actually opened to honest dialogue and thinking. Excellent interview.
Wow. Great interview. Finally something engaging and curious without the needless confrontational questions he usually gets. Well done!
And my mind cant stop saying: ”That book is more blue than purple”.....
The way they talked was so refreshing. An actual fact based conversation with hints of personal opinion. Awesome
I can already imagine the first civil claim for micro aggression. “He ruined my night out at the bar... I want $500”.
"Who's disliking these videos? ""This man talks sense, I don't like it."" Really?"
beautiful interview. thanks for the discussion
"I have huge respect for this interviewer, she's actually listening to someone else's opinion instead of injecting question after question to just ignore what point Peterson just made"
a JBP video with no clickbait title???? im offended
Society breaks down. Slowly. And we have universities as cesspools to breed these ideologies
Really really like the way the woman (and Petersen obviously) carry themselves in this discussion.
"When I saw that Jordan Peterson was being interviewed by Christie Blatchford I immediately had to watch this video.  It is so sad that we have lost such a great journalist.  Rest in peace Christie Blatchford, we miss you."
I am tired of the term “micro aggression”. I feel like it advocates and encourages weak psychological and emotional maturity and strength.
I'd love to see more conversations like this.
Hoping Christie is doing well in her battle with Cancer. One of the few good ones.
"""I'm offended"" is nothing more than accepting you are unwilling to control your own emotions and expect others to do so for you."
"""What are women now? We don't know."" 

I laughed at how simple that phrase is yet how much sense it makes given what he's discussing."
Sad how so many people rely on political programming to govern their behavior instead of just innate common sense and personal morality.
"Hi, Folks.
Hats off to both of them, Jordan for his in-depth analysis and his ability to cut through the shit and to express his views simply and to Christie for her open-mindedness and curiosity.


A good video.


Just my 0.02.


You all have a wonderful day. Best wishes. Deas Plant."
Christie Blatchford a legend and a real journalist. 🙏 RIP.
"""Don't have a meeting with the door closed"", if that does not scare you, you need to think about it again..."
Dr. Jordan Peterson for PM!
"I love this, it’s an actual discussion with both parties actually listening to each other."
"Just read that this lady died not long after this interview. I have never come across her before but what a refreshing thing to watch two grown ups having a decent discussion. RIP young lady, you sounded a very interesting woman."
Why can't we have more women Interviewers like this woman? She is absolutely brilliant!!!
I'm very impressed with how open minded this woman is! Mr Peterson receives a lot of hostility usually 👍
Thank God for this conversation!
I miss Christie Blatchford. She was an old school crime reporter. Always enjoyed her take on criminal trials. RIP Christie.
"ahh, a great conversation. It's nice to see someone jordan's talking to respond in a way other than ""so what you're saying is..."""
I’m buying a gun so that no one confuses my micro aggressions.
"You know things have gone really bad, when we are all happy to listen to a respectful, intelligent, normal conversation... 

Bless this woman for not being defensive nor agressive with and to him."
It's refreshing to see an interview where the goal isnt to make Dr. Peterson look bad.
"To all liberals and lefties out there, this is how you have a conversation about something important.
Notice no name calling, no wild assumptions, no accusations, no smearing, no crying, no screaming and no tantrums.... That's how it's done in a civilized society."
"I was so shocked the day I heard of her passing. 

A legendary Toronto journalist."
"She's a pretty good interviewer, and listens."
"As someone who has been a recipient of sexual harassment, I define it as repeated advances when it is clear that it is unwanted.

One guy that I was interviewing for a student paper when I was 18 grabbed me to keep me from leaving the room.  When you have to overcome a person's defenses to have sexual contact with them, that should be a clue. 

I think it goes beyond asking someone if they want to go out on a date and being turned down."
"I could listen to these two talk all day. Such intelligence, understanding and respect."
Heartening to see a true journalist!
"The real question is, why do the mainstream media not want to have a genuine conversation and why do they want to mislead their audience?"
"""Having never really had the fortune to spend any time in an Iranian prison, for example, they're not very good at distinguishing between what constitutes a tyranny and what constitutes a free society.""  So damn true."
"When is an action figure of Mr Peterson being created....!.? 
The man's a legend"
"Wow, she seems like one smart cookie. Prayers for more women like her."
refreshing to see a female interviewer having a calm conversation with Peterson for once
"""Every value system produces a hierarchy.  So if you dispense with the hierarchy you dispense with the value system.""  Brilliant."
"""You cant divorce sex from respect"""
"A video of intelligent discussion, can't say the same about the comment section though."
I m a left leaning humanist ...and not a conservative at all...but Dr Jordan s someone I can listen to for hours. He s so intellectually honest and he respects traditional gender roles. It's so rare in men and in intellectuals that it shines through him . Respect.
"Many  people  can't  stand dr
Peterson  cause he is very
Intelligent  and he has a strong back bone as a  man"
"each time I listen to MR Peterson,  I learn something new. thank you."
I love JP and I thank God for having an opportunity to listen to his arguments on various social problems and concerns... It almost feels like many of my ignorant walls are being shattered down through his logical and wise comments... I hope more people from our society listen to him and come to realization of what's right and what's wrong on many unfair prejudiced social issues at hand...this is a war on ideology....
I sometimes disagree with Jordan but I think he's right on here.
I have so much respect for both of them. Heart-warming dialogue
"MeToo war wichtig hat jedoch das Ziel verfehlt. Die Mächtigen haben, wie man jetzt sieht, einfach weitergemacht. Ich bin heute der Meinung, dass der Kollateralschaden viel zu hoch war! Sagt schon viel aus, dass ihre kein Wort über die Kollateralschäden dieser Bewegung sagt."
Am besten ist doch wenn Frauen und Männer gut zusammenleben.
"17:42 ich glaube, dass es weniger die ""Vorurteile"" der Richter/Richterinnen sind, die eine Verurteilung erschweren sondern viel mehr, ein Problem der Nachweisbarkeit besteht (Aussage gegen Aussage, fehlende forensische Beweisaufnahme usw.)."
Dachte metoo ist ein Pokémon
"Mir hat mal jemand einen tollen Job als Reiseleiterin auf Kuba angeboten. Dafür hätte ich allerdings mit ihm ins Bett gehen müssen. Ich habe das abgelehnt - und natürlich den Job nicht bekommen.
Mein Fazit ist also, dass viele Frauen mitmachen, weil sie auf der Karriereleiter hochsteigen wollen und das in Kauf nehmen.
Sie könnten aber auch ""nein"" sagen!!!
Vermutlich verkaufen sich ganz viele Leute, um beruflich aufzusteigen - und nicht nur auf sexuelle Art.
Ja, das ist nicht gerecht, aber es ist leider so"
"Es geht auf jeden fall in die richtige Richtung. Jeder einzelne hat viele verletzungen, von denen wir kol,etiv lernen und aufeinander zugehen können."
Ich finde bdas sehr gut wenn sich die Frauen wehren finde ich sehr gut weiter so
Sehr viele Incels in den Kommentaren hier 😬
Opferkult
Warum lassen die Frauen sich das gefallen?
Now media will spoil the career of Emraan Hashmi by showing this repeatedly so that after big directors will not take him in their films.This bulshit media did the same thing with Sushant singh rajput
"""Believe all women"" led to Amber Heard. Never again with that nonsense."
“Believe all woman” that’s the dumbest thing I’ve amber heard
"""Virgin until I was married and proud of it"" man that's refreshing to hear"
I 100% agree. There have been plenty cases were the woman was falsely accusing men of rape. Those men will never get rid of those accusations.
"They say ""believe all women,"" when they can't even define what a woman is."
I was a virgin until I got married too and it was the best decision of my life!!!
"The saddest part is after the woman is found to have lied, she gets no punishment and the man gets no reimbursement for the job, money, career he lost."
Agreed! My ex lied ..they believed at first..then her story fell apart..our children told the truth.. her true colors came out.. and she ended up getting arrested!! Sad but I was so thankful that the justice system worked!! Shame on anyone who lies to smear a decent human being! Meaning all cases are separate and can't just believe any group/ category..seek the truth in every single case!
"Ben, my husband was slso a virgin. He remains the most honorable man I have ever met."
"""Believe all women"" and ""You can't define a Woman"" have somehow been said by the same group of people in the same political party. 
Ain't that wacky?"
"If we believe all women, then what do we do when one woman calls another woman a liar 🤔"
"""Virgin until I was married and proud of it.""

My respect for him just went 📈📈📈📈📈"
"""I'm virgin until i got married ""
We exist guys, it's just that we don't usually use that as a brag

Damn now i want to brag with that"
"""Virgin until married and proud of it"" - Takes balls to say that considering how many american trolls I encountered! Much respect! 💪🏻🇷🇴☦"
The thing that bothers me most about ‘me too’ is when the woman is proven to have lied all the celebrities or politicians who came to her defence never apologize.
Women who lie and slander men need to go to prison for the same amount of time of a rape crime and it should be just as serious crime. just one more thing broken in the justice system?
"The whole ""believe all women"" idea worked so great for Disney, that they lost the entire Pirates series now. 😄"
"""I am the only man in America who was a virgin until I got married and proud of it"" meanwhile, 28 year old virgin me doubting if I am American 🤔"
This man has a moral compass that is commendable.  God bless him and his conviction!
"As a woman, For heavens sake, Do Not believe all women. That is the craziest thing Ive ever heard."
“ you can’t believe all woman any more than u can believe all men “ agreed. With what’s mentioned in this vid really sheds a spotlight on what’s currently going on with the Amber heard and Johnny depp situation.
"No Ben, you are not the only man in America who is a virgin .... 39 years old and still waiting on the Lord to bless me with the joy and beauty of a God-centered, God-blessed marriage."
"I’m a female and I’m also waiting for marriage! So I’m happy that you also waited for marriage, not many people do that."
"You can hate Ben as much as you want, but you can't deny him because he is one of the few voices of reason."
"Feminists: ""Believe all women""
Patriarchy: ""What's a woman?""
Feminists: ""Ummm...."""
"“Go ahead, tell everyone I hit you, they always believe the woman.” - My privileged-former girlfriend. She was just a moment. My two older sisters abused me my entire life, they are borderline sociopathic, a professor and guidance counselor. I keep my distance from all three, and they can all go to Hell."
"When women get caught with false allegation they should get a minimum of 5 years. The man loses everything with one false allegation. His job, family, kids, ect..."
As a woman I know why all women should NOT be believed
"To be a virgin until marriage is something that DEMANDS respect. You have mine, Ben."
"The moment I knew that ""Believe All Women"" was a lie was when my Ex said she loves me."
"I was a virgin till I married my wife, of twelve years now. Many coworkers/older men have told me they wish they had waited."
My admiration for Ben just went off the chart. A man that remained a virgin until marriage is a solid.
"My son was a virgin until he got married at 25.  He always had girlfriends, but he practiced his Christian beliefs, which lost him a few gf's.  I'm very proud of him."
My hubby was a virgin! He was 24 and we have been married over 30 years! Love you hubby!
The dude is just verbally and mentally talented
"My brother was stabbed my his female partner, she didn't even know why she did it! Two weeks in hospital with a punctured lung. So when people say men are the only abusers, it sends me nuts!"
Liberals: “Ben Shapiro hated women until his teenage years!”
I wish I was made out of the same stuff as Ben Shapiro. He's completely brilliant and held up high moral standards for himself
"When they say believe all women, just reply with two simple words, Amber Heard."
"I have never heared anybody say ""believe all women"" it is always rather ""believe the victim (untill proven otherwise)"" and it never refers to a court room but to everyday people interacting with the victim. It is supposed to protect actual victims from public abuse and mobbing."
“Believe all women” gave us women like Amber Heard and many others who took advantage of the #metoo movement. I’ll never understand how people can lie about things like that. Men also deserve to be heard and believed
"Damn, a true sigma. Dude straight up said, “I was a virgin until I was married”."
"I remained a virgin till I was married as well Ben. For 27 years I remained one, and I can look my wife in the eyes and proudly say that she is the only woman that I've ever had a relationship in that manner with."
I can guarantee you’re not the only man in America with that particular distinction
"“Believe all women” tell that to my friend that was put in prison for rape. Only to be released 1.5 years later because they found out the girl lied, so that her long term boyfriend wouldn’t dump her for cheating on him."
“What about the psychos?” -Bill Burr
"I think it was Bill Burr who said ""Believe All Women!"" ""Um, have you met women?"" Lol"
"My son was accused of attempted murder, but his real crime was breaking up with her.  Her revenge was accusing him of trying to murder her.  It took $50K and three years to clear him.  There was no penalty for her."
My brothers are virgins and proud of it. Thanks Ben for advocating for men to be real men! It’s a beautiful thing when a man is a real man and woman is a real woman.
I am 17 and a virgin and plan to be till I'm married I am proud because it was very hard for me even being unpopular till 7th grade I had chances to lose it and I'm glad I didn't
The people that say believe all women never heard of the duke lacrosse scandal
I'm a woman and I believe men way more than I do women.
"And then Amber Heard said, ""Me too!"""
I got Johnny Depped by my ex. I'm glad the witch hunt against men is coming to an end and people are waking up without fear to speak out. You are my hero Ben Shapiro
This is literally the only  stuff on the internet that makes sense
"""believe all women when they claim a crime happened!""
or
""believe all men when they say 'okay, show me the proof'.""
one is insane, the other makes perfect sense."
"As a woman, yep. I agree with Ben here. Believe facts and not because of their gender, race or status. 

If a man abuses a woman, punish him as well as a woman abusing a man. No exemption."
I had my life destroyed by a liar. I may never fully recover.
"“Never trust women”
My mom"
"Honestly i agree with you just a lot
You are seen as right wing but you seem more left wing bc you actually love equality"
"This is a piece of advice my parents gave me "" Don't believe anyone until they give you solid proof to do so. """
"You're a man of principles. You're a good role model to our "" lost "" young generation that needs direction. Proud of you Ben. Keep up the good work. God bless you more!"
"2020: BELIEVE ALL WOMEN

2022: what's a woman?🤷"
"“The only man in America who was a virgin until he got married and was proud of it” I’m sure he’s not the only man to have done this, but he’s probably one of the only men who was, in fact, proud of that"
"amber heard should be the face of why ""believe all women"" is bull malarkey."
"""Trust but verify."" - Horatio Caine (CSI Miami)"
“Believe all woman” made me immediately think about the Amber Heard situation
"Believe all women doesn't mean skip the trial. It means what women say shouldn't be skipped over or justified in some way. Boys will be boys shouldn't be something to justify a woman being abused by a man. Believe them, don't ignore the evidence and favor them"
"Ben is awesome .
He speaks logically which my brain is starving for.."
I agree with him on everything except one thing: he is not the only person to retain his virginity until marriage and be proud of it. My husband and I did the same thing and I personally know many others who make promises just like us and are proud to do so.
"As a woman, I am more inclined to believe a man over a woman."
"Any one attacking Ben for no legitimate reasons, says it all about the persons character 
And shows the privileged mentally evil people we deal with."
"""Believe all women"" led to Amber Heard AND her lawyer

God, that women whom she calls a ""lawyer"" was insufferable"
"""Believe all women""

That's the dumbest thing I've Amber Heard."
I love this man!!! He keeps it real. Virgin until married? Much respect. I'm Romanian orthodox and work.for  a kosher establishment.  This is awesome !!!
"A smart man, an honorable man. God bless him. Amen."
This man is literally amazing.
The realism and backbone this man has is what needs to be taught to kids today! Speak the truth! Facts
Couldn’t agree with you more Ben.
"My mother is retired LEO, was the first person to educate me on this, blew my mind at a ""young"" age"
"Johnny Depp has done a great service to men and the false accusations.  the me too movement is a disgrace to women.  When I was young I dealt with bottom touching, inapprpriate remarks with humour and walked away.  Trust me it stops."
"(Men) been told they should “Believe all women”... 
Truth is (Women) never “Believe all women”.."
We need many more people like Ben to go to the colleges and try and talk some sense into these brainwashed students nowadays. God bless you Ben!🙏🙌
"Believe woman that aren’t lying 
that would have been a better slogan"
"The main reason I like YouTube over TikTok:
On YouTube, you have people who may not agree with Ben on everything but at least agreeing with Ben on this and people sharing their stories and people trying to console those people and we can all agree that this is a terrible thing. 
On TikTok, however, I guarantee at least half of these comments would be toxic, infuriating, and disgusting to look at. On TikTok, I guarantee you would see people who don't support Ben insulting and shitting on him instead of respecfully disagreeing with his stance. Also, I guarantee you would see a bunch of toxic ""feminist"" TikTok girls supporting ""the believe all women"" movement and invalidating the experiences of guys who have suffered at the hands of this #metoo shit. 

Trust me, as a frequent TikTok user and as someone who comes across these videos a lot, I promise you this is accurate, at least in comment sections for videos like this that I've seen."
Ben was a virgin until marriage? Well that gives me a little bit of hope.
"""Women understand women...and they hate each other""
Al Bundy"
Someone said believe all women and I’m like what about Biden… then the excuses came in.
"When a woman like Amber lies, it harms all women!  The liars need to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law!"
Used to be innocent till proven guilty
"""Believe all women"" led us to Christine Blasey Ford and the Democrats attempted character assassination of Brett Kavanaugh."
"Basically the real root of the problem is... common sense. All these ""problems"" we keep running into is because it seems less and less people have common sense."
"Don't worry Ben, I was also a virgin when I married my husband, best decision ever"
The more clips I see of him the more I wish he would run for President..  There's nothing we need more in this country than a president with a little bit of common Sense. And it seems like he has a whole lot of it.
Ahm...my husband was too...we both were...🥰
"Honestly, The leftists have had a dark age lately. Which brings tears to my eyes. Tears of joy"
"I feel extremely inadequate when I hear ben speak. Damn, he's got his priorities straight"
His mind is as fast and sharp as his tongue
"My dad was a virgin until he was married, I know because he told me when we had the talk."
I can imagine how proud your parents are❤️👏🏻👏🏻God bless you Ben
"On the Kindle bookshelf is a pretty good book by Valerie Sparkle called Surprise Violations. It has a lot of Me, Too stories from long before the Me, Too movement finally came into being. Glad that these strong folks brought the stories into the forefront, as for so many more years, they have been going on."
all of the women like Oprah Winfrey who KNEW about Weinstein did nothing...and get no criticism...sick
Isn't Twohey the one who smeared Justin Baldoni?
A pig is a pig
#metoo and no Tarana Burke?
Dont have to be much of critical thinker to WONDER what other groups and people have been doing EVIL things being kept secret. Keep Digging.
Mgtow!
He looks like a Troll - Mole.
No one has talked about this for a year??
"How wonderfully classic: ""Follow the money"""
"I haven't kept up with Sunday morning in awhile so maybe I didn't hear about it, but did they change the person who chooses the sun at the end of the segment. So far, I've watched the milk story and this one, and in my opinion, both suns are lacking."
Yeah all these actresses got on their knees for movie parts on their own. They could have walked out the room.  Today they are all rich too.
what an evil man !
I belong to the: #Touch-Me Movement.
Here  is the problem  with  the we too movement  kniw it will hold back women  because  know it will be harder  for women  to get promotion  or get a higher  paying jobs. Know  the work force will be run more  bumy men instead  of a qualified  woman. ...it will hurt  and hold a line that  women  will not be able  to move up the latter. Because  of this movement. ....is not good  for women. ....sorry  to tell you  the truth. ..
#Theme Justin
wart hog....
The make up  hair and clothing folks sexualized the 2 reporters. Young and thin so why not show them off.
#metoo     liberal arrogance
How does the future belong to one gender? I thought feminism was about equality!
Let's all agree that nobody deserves to be sexually harassed. :)
The future isn't female. It's digital.
"Women: My body, my choice.

Men: My wallet, my money."
#MeToo is causing a severe recession in the Golddigging industry.
Amber Heard has made a mockerey of this movement.
We the men who support men being abused by women are going to rise and women are going to be held accountable.  Thank you Johnny Depp 😘
MGTOW is Also on The Horizon As Well
The future is robot sophiea..
"I served in the Armed Forces,when in uniform i had my arse felt,crouch,and one woman tried to pull me into a toilet on a train,#hypocrites"
"I have never been raped or sexually harraseed or bullied but my support goes to the men and women who have. Lets get rid of predators in power. Men and women who sexually exploit those beneath them. Eventually, the world needs to focus on molestation at the forefront. This is one of  the biggest crime that plagues humanity."
"According to feminism, both genders are equal... Just that women are more equal."
We avoid women now. It actually makes life easier. 😂👍
"I'm not a feminist, and this movement ticked me off for various reasons... But as a South African lady, I can confirm that there is a bit problem with domestic abuse towards women in this country."
"If i may ask, what does metoo and the phrase ""the future is female"" have in common? The combination makes it look like this is about power."
Make life more peaceful and enjoyable.  Just go MGTOW.
This move is going to cost up-and-coming marriages for years to come.
"Men: Exsist
3rd wave femnist: OMG HE BREATHED THE SAME AIR PARTICLES AS ME!!!! RAAAAPPPEEE"
I think I'll just stay home and avoid getting too close to anyone forever
why is my dishwasher not working
The future is AI
Redpilled fellows hit like.
I'm so MGTOW
"5 years later, men understand to avoid all unnecessary contact with women."
Metoo. Sorry ladies no more sleeping your way to the top.
Well this aged badly...
"Against me too. Not against women but absolutely amd all the way against me too. Just because it judges the whole male population as one entity,  rather than focusing on the problems caused by some disorderly  individuals. This movement is totally and most important  blindly against half the population of the earth. My stand has changed towards women after that, because I don't know if one specific woman is a supportive or not of this movement. So I don't talk to women,  don't flirt, don't walk close to them, dont  say goodmorning  or hello to any woman, don't ask for help if I see a woman in a store, don't interact at all. In this case the movement 's ideals and standards have neen met and it is absolutely keeping me as a man - that it knows I am as a male a Hazzard to society- away from all the females of this planet.  So yes the future is female and I don't  want to be a part of this  future. Men gowing  their own way, away from women."
where's the virtual reality for how it feels like to be falsely accused?
#Metoo and #feminisn ere more negative than positive right now
How valid is a movement if it is abandoned when leaders of the movement go silent when it involves a violator from their own ranks.  It loses its credibility.
GREAT I WANT GENDER SEGREGATION AT WORK. I HOPE IT WILL START SOON
Jordan Peterson is my hero.
As a business owner I will never even consider hiring a woman not worth it
I’m not gonna apologize for something someone I don’t know did.
Is there a VR scenario for women to experience what it's like for men to be abused by his wife?
"So wait what about the guys who were falsely accused oh wait ""Future is female""."
Ita changing the world alright...for the worse...
"Millions of young men recruited for war have died as well. Mostly for the wealthy class owners of the world and mainly for mineral and oil resources. These young men died to protect and secure the rights of their countrymen (and women) to speak out freely for any cause they wished. So, in effect, young men are being taken advantage of and being 'body sold' (trafficked) on a much larger scale and for a much longer period of time because they are existentially expendable to the battle field. Women don't actually have that burden, but they do frequently suffer men's primal instincts as men often suffer theirs, only differently."
"We all forget the very purpose of women rights——equality. The future is to be shared by all people regardless of sex, not just male or female."
So much of the things they accuse men doing to them happens to men too.
"regarding South Afirca, this will achieve nothing"
"Women : The future is us, we will rule the world.
Me: laughs in toxic masculinity in Saudi."
"Grats feminists 

You’ve completely cancelled human interaction altogether 

Hope your happy :)"
I dont think I can ever return home from Japan.  This country is great. No bs drama and woman here are way more happier.  Both men and woman dont have rediculous life expectations.
"By Cultural & Economic Standards, us western women need to be grateful and conscience of our privileges and quality of lives...
#DeepPink"
The future isn't women it's a robot's flying cars and stuff like that
"The real beauty of all this is that it will show men that they are inherently toxic, and should pursue their passions and livelihood WITHOUT women, so as not to cause them any trouble. 

Womanists, don't even tell me that you are offended by this... or even call me names... If you do either, you may as well admit that you really are NOT strong NOR independent.. and that you DO need men... and having those beliefs is misogynistic. Thank you."
"Reality of feminism 
Equal rights = yes yes 
.
Equal responsibility = fuck no no"
Best way to deal with women in the workplace is to interact with them as little as possible.
Metoo has made it so complicated and risky for man and women to work together that it is better to segregate them at workplace
I like the virtual reality goggles to get the point across.
MGTOW is the last hope
The misogyny in the comments is astounding. I guess most men forget who birthed them.
"Do we still need feminism? Yes.
Do we need feminism in developed countries like America? Absolutely not."
western world is wierd
"Me Too in a nutshell 30 years ago a man did something I didn't like.... I never said anything about it until now but without evidence, proof, or any fact believe me and punish the man assuming he is guilty and even if he is proven innocent treat him as though he were guilty. Then call everyone who disagrees a misogynist."
"Hmm interesting to see the massive dislikes and critical comments. In my opinion, it should start with education system. Fix that before attempting other fixes. I am glad that companies taking harassments more serious now than before so this is a good start."
"Apparently not a single man has ever been sexually assaulted or harassed according to this narrative, what a relief, I suppose it must have been another ""Misogynistic"" hallucination of memory"
"Wow, they are putting VR reprogramming devices on the faces of men now? I worked in education for many years. Female dominated industry. I have been flashed by a female coworker because i wouldn't feel how perky her breasts were. Two female bosses would walk up and rub my back while grading papers, comment on my muscles. Refused a coworkers advances on a few occasions, one would end up stalking me for over a month. She would sit in my truck leave notes, spray perfume etc. She even said she was going to kill herself over the situation; this particular situation happened in the early 90s just as companies were adopting sexual harassment training policies. So, I'm gonna sit through the rest of this video and role my eyes, thank you very much"
You just have to understand that I want to live in an equal society. The movement started because women need respect . Just never become what you fight.
Movements come and they go as always.
"How about using hijab,.or convert to Islam, even better.    Learn about how Islam ruling about man and woman should/must behave toward each other, But please not from biassed media."
Jordan Peterson is controversial? Really? So what exactly is controversial about him? When you accuse someone with that heavy words you should be able to back it up.
Im am so grateful that my country doesn't have this problem...why? Because we're too busy dealing with floods and economic crisis which looks way BETTER than whatever this is
"If men express themself emotionally they will get exploited by woman whenever its beneficial to them and at the same time get told they should hate themself as men for being a man....masculinity is a male choice for us to accept as it is and how we choose to be, if not expressing myself is part of masculinity then it should be my choice and be left to it."
this movement threatens the song baby it’s cold outside
"The card board sign should read:
""The future is NOT male, nor white female"""
"For starters she's way overdone the makeup which women use to attract men while at the same time calling a mans attention to her harassment. Women are truly illogical with their emotions switching by the minute and of course are ALWAYS the victim.Men won't put their hands up and say ""Ok ladies you win"" Experienced men know how to play a woman that lets her think she's in charge and so the age old game will go on and all this bullshit will only appeal to the idiots who suck it up."
Me Too has affected the lifes of a thousand men at most but harmed the potential career prospects of over a hundred thousand women.
Pure propaganda
Who else was here to read the comments about people saying #metoo?
"Blue: afraid, deluded, and controlled 
Red: fearless dawg, reality, and a warrior"
The disconnect in the #MeToo movement is that many (if not all) of the female Hollywood actors who initially came forward to protest sexual harassment and sexual assault at the hands of Hollywood producers and directors were perfectly content to allow themselves to be sexually objectified on screen in exchange for large sums of cash.  Is it altogether surprising then that these women were treated as sexual objects by the same men who paid them in the first place?   Women can't both use their sexuality as a means to get what they want from men and then at the same time expect that men will not look at and treat them as sexual objects.
the future isn't female it's men it will all ways be
When are women ever happy?
Scientists need to hurry up with those sexbots
WE ARE NOT OVARY ACTING IS GENIUS
"This ""Future is female""
Thing isn't that great of a message.
Both sexes should be considered equals."
2:23 why does she seem so proud and happy to be talking about this.
the lady says u can’t do work if u can’t have a 1 on 1 meeting but now u literally can’t look at a girl for 5 seconds
"Thanks for producing this content, it is appreciated. The Economist’s comment section seems to be one of the most vitriolic I’ve seen, for some reason.  Kudos for this reporting, not all of us here are haters."
This movement is toxic in everyway.
"You know I’m happy about this. But I hope it won’t get out of hand. Also we always overlook that men can also be assaulted sexually, but so can women and they dominate that area which we need to change."
"This man : ""it's the suspicion of men that is clearly not in anyone's interest"" SORRY, you mean in MENS interest."" This man gives off big :  oh no ... the consequences of my actions vibes"
"It's not hard, seriously its common sense.  Men and women, would you be happy if your son or daughter or sister or friend was being treated as your talking to your co-worker, then go ahead. If not change  that behaviour"
"At, my health club, I've watched, men walk away from women, the women want to be noticed by the men, but the men will leave, women standing alone, in an area, of the gym and return when the woman leaves,"
proud of every single woman speaking up! i believe you. i will always believe you!!❤️
"What about now? Why isn’t Joe Biden being held up to the same standard?

I wonder if politicians used this for their own political interest🤔"
"I think that some things are being mixed here. I totally agree with the right of women to not being sexually harassed, and I think men who do such things are not real men. However I don't see why the video also want to speak about the gender disparity in positions of power. I remember Jordan Peterson saying something about this issue, which is: there has been plenty of time for women to reach positions of power, and yet there is this gender gap there. I don't think that women are less capable intellectually or anything, but I do think that men and women are different. There's no such thing as the ""right to be in a position of power"", because, by definition of power, that's not how it works. There might be rules of course, written or not written, but I don't think gender distinction should be done to favor one or the other.


Clearly this is a lot (infinitely) more complicated than this, and obviously I think it's good that women speak up about untold harassment."
"All the comments are encouraging on here, it's great to seethe majority see through the metoo movement and their lies, thank you!!"
These women should think about their sons.
Is it gender equality?  Or feminist superiority?
"(cough, cough) Johnny Depp"
"Remember, Ego's, we have masculine and feminine inside of each and everyone of us; in past lives you have been both. The rising of women does not mean the fall of men, maybe monsters but if your not one of them you have nothing to worry about. The healthy masculine without insecurities of his own power will never feel the need to put someone below himself, he will not be afraid of having his other half in an empowered state. Thank you Lilith, Kali Ma, Mother Mary, and Lord Sananda and all the brave sisters and brothers of humanity that are stepping into the light of truth and justice. I bless all ignorant, asleep beings who can't see the need for this movement with pure love and light, with pure source consciousness, with balanced feminine and masculine energy. ♡♥♡♥"
The future is male! 💪🏻
MeToo?  Why did you all go watch 50 Shades and Magic Mike?
I hope that all fake-accusers will be sentenced and punished.
The biggest #MeToo is narendra modi but no one told him anything
Good job. This fund had successfully tightened the relationship among people from the high and low social classes
time has no gender.

Auf diesem Kanal wird die Kommentarfunktion unter allen 13 Fragen-Videos deaktiviert, bereits gepostete Kommentare bleiben bestehen."
"Hätte nie gedacht, dass ich jemals eine Diskussion zwischen Silvi Carlsson, Desirée Nick und Ulf Poschardt sehe😅"
"Ich finds nach wie vor schade, dass das ZDF 13 Fragen nicht im Fernsehen ausstrahlt. Meiner Meinung nach eines der besten Diskussionsformate in Deutschland, regt mich immer wieder zum nachdenken an."
"""Ich identifiziere mich nicht als privilegiert"" war mein Favorit. Sie ist wahrscheinlich Millionärin die in der Öffentlichkeit steht. Wenn die nicht privilegiert ist was ist dann der Großteil der Gesellschaft"
"Da wurde mir dann doch noch mal bewusst, in welcher Bubble ich mich befinde. Konnte das Video noch nicht ganz anschauen, weil ich mich soooo getriggert fühle. Das ist eine Klatsche ins Gesicht, was Desiree von sich gibt."
"Silvi war ganz stark. Ich finde es so stark, dass sie als Betroffene so viel Contenence bei so viel Whataboutism, Ablenkung und mangelnder Empathie auf der anderen Seite halten kann. Ich bin in Gedanken bei allen Betroffenen, die dieses Video gucken und sich zurecht getriggert und nicht gehört fühlen! Ich glaube euch!"
"Hahaha, ich musste laut auflachen als die Schauspielerin meinte ""Jede Frau kann sagen ... bitte rufen sie mein Management an!"" Die ist sowas von weltfremd die glaubt jede Frau in der Arbeitswelt hat ein Management Team!"
"Es ist so einfach zu sagen ""ja lass es doch einfach nicht zu"". So einfach ist das nicht. Ich bin an sich ein sehr selbstbewusster Mensch jedoch ist mir das Blut in den Adern gefroren als mir jemand so zu nahe kam, ich habe mich so überrumpelt gefühlt, da kommt einem kaum in den Sinn sich in dem Moment zu behaupten. Da will man einfach nur weg und mit niemandem darüber reden."
"Mich hat die Me-too-Bewegung vor allem in dem Sinne beeinflusst, dass ich die Erfahrungen, die ich gemacht habe, nicht mehr selbst herunterspiele (war vielleicht gar nicht so schlimm, vielleicht bin ich zu empfindlich, meine Gefühle diesbezüglich sind evtl übertrieben).
Zu sehen, dass andere Personen es genauso bewerten wie mein inneres Gefühl hat mich bestärkt, den Mund aufzumachen.
Und als ich mich getraut habe, hat mein Arbeitgeber mich auch ernst genommen und vorbildlich gehandelt 👍🏻"
"Wie kann man als Frau dort stehen und den Frauen die Schuld daran geben, belästigt zu werden, weil sie es nicht geschafft haben ""ihr Berufs- und Privatleben zu trennen""!?! Dass Frau Nick sich nicht in Grund und Boden schämt..."
"Ich finde es ebenfalls realitätsfern von Frau Nick einfach davon auszugehen, dass alle anderen Menschen die gleiche Handlungsstruktur besitzen, wie sie nach außen. Ich bezweifle, dass sie in jeder SItuation in der Lage ist, sich zu wehren, sich abzugrenzen, ""einfach zu gehen"". Es wird immer jemanden geben, der die eigenen Grenzen nicht nur übertreten kann, sondern sie auch mit Gewalt eintritt. Das Glück gehabt zu haben, dies - auch wieder nach außen - nie erfahren haben zu müssen, vor allem als Frau, ist ein Privileg. Das ist nicht die Norm, das ist die Ausnahme. Und auch steckt dahinter keine Stärke, kein Mehrwert im eigenen Handeln, sondern einfach pures fucking Glück."
"""Und daher möchte ich die Frauen bitten, sich dem ganzen nicht zur Verfügung zu stellen"" Bitte was? Wie sehr möchte man bitte sexuelle Übergriffe verharmlosen. Ich bin wirklich schockiert."
"Die Meinung von Desiree Nick finde ich sehr realitätsfern. Ich wurde von 18 bis 20 als duale Studentin in einem Hotel regelmäßig von meinem Chef (Ende 30) in Gesprächen am Arm festgehalten, während dem Sitzen an den Schultern massiert, für eine viel zu lange Zeit umarmt. Ich hatte dadurch das Gefühl, dass er seine Macht über mich demonstrieren wollte, was er auch geschafft hat. In diesen Situationen bin ich komplett handlungsunfähig gewesen, obwohl ich sonst eine Person bin, die sehr stark für sich einsteht. Da es in diesem Hotel keinen höheren Vorgesetzten, Betriebsrat oder ähnliches gegeben hat, an den ich mich hätte wenden können, blieb mich letztendlich nicht anderes als die Kündigung um mich dieser Situation zu entziehen. 
Das ganze ist jetzt zwei Jahre her und wenn ich mal über diese Erfahrung spreche, kommt mir oft Unverständnis entgegen. 
Von Personen wie Desiree Nick zu hören sich ""einfach nicht der Situation auszusetzen"" finde ich daher einfach nur schade.

Edit: Da es ja anscheinend sehr viele Meinungen mit SEHR vieler freier Interpretation zu meiner Situation gibt, konkretisiere ich das: Mein Chef war meines Erachtens ein Narzist. Nach meiner Kündigung hat er bis zu meinem letzten Arbeitstag nicht mehr mit mir gesprochen, mir nicht in die Augen gesehen, mir unschöne Aufgaben (Fugen der Hotelbadezimmer mit Zahnbürsten schrubben) erteilen lassen. In anderen Diskussionen (Mangel der Ausbildung, Arbeitssicherheit) zeigte er keinerlei Selbstreflexion oder Einsicht. Ich bin mir daher sicher, dass ich mit der Ansprache, dass ich dieser Berührungen nicht möchte, nichts positives erreicht hätte. 

ZUDEM hat er mich so stark festgehalten, dass danach Abdrücke am Arm zu sehen waren. Das war kein ""ich fasse meine Mitarbeiterin kurz freundschaftlich an, das empfindet sie bestimmt auch so"", sondern ein bewusst hartes zugreifen. Die Umarmungen waren entweder seitlich oder von hinten, es war nie so, als ob ich diese erwidert hätte oder gar von mir ausgingen. Ich musste ihn siezen, er duzte mich. Es gab keinerlei freundschaftliche Beziehung zwischen uns, die ein anfassen gerechtfertigt hätte. Selbst wenn das nicht der Fall gewesen wäre, hat ein Mensch bei einem Machtgefälle die Hände bei sich zu lassen. 

Und zur Erinnerung:  hier geht es um echte Menschen mit individuellen Erfahrungen, Charakterzügen und Emotionen. Eine Ferndiagnose ist nicht erwünscht. Wer nichts nettes zu meiner Erfahrung zu sagen hat, kann das gerne dem nächst gelegenen Baum erzählen :)"
"Ich habe mal als Flugbegleiterin gearbeitet und was ich da im Cockpit und bei Overnights so an sexueller Belästigung, unangenehmen Gesprächen, Missbrauch von Hierarchie usw. erlebt habe finde ich aus meiner heutigen Sicht absolut krass. Damals fand ich es auch unangenehm, aber ich konnte es nicht richtig einordnen und hab alles immer versucht schlagfertig zu kontern etc. Wenn ich das mal nicht geschafft habe, hab ich teilweise die Schuld bei mir gesucht, weil ich so ""unlocker"" bin. Heute würde ich solchen Situationen ganz anders begegnen, aber wenn man jung ist, dann hat man dieses Standing einfach noch nicht. Es muss noch einiges passieren, aber bitte ohne Krampf und die ständige Angst etwas falsches zu machen oder Männern generell keinerlei ""typisch männlichen Attribute"" zuzugestehen."
"Ich habe viele sexistische und sexuelle Übergriffe erlebt - vorallem aber in meinen Aushilfsjobs, bei denen ich das austauschsbarste Glied in der Kette war. Und ich kann berichten: egal wie oft ein übergriff stattgefunden hat, jedes mal war ich wie gelehmt. All die Schlagfertigkeit die mir sonst zugesprochen wurde, ist verschwunden. 

Ich habe mal als Kellnerin in einem Club gearbeitet. Standard Mainstreamschuppen. Als ich gerade Getränke auf dem Tisch abstellen wollte, griff mir ein Gast von hinten in den Schritt. Ich schoss hoch, schlug die Hand weg, konnte noch den Kopf schütteln und ging weg. Es ist nunmal nicht so, dass man sich auf so einen übergriff vorbereiten kann und dann Karate auspackt. Meine Schockreaktion war Flucht. Ich ging zum Türsteher um den Mann rausschmeißen zu lassen. Der Türsteher sagte zu mir ""naja Mäuschen, das kann schonmal passieren, das solltest du aushalten können, die menschen trinken hier eben"". Weil mir also von dem menschen, der mir helfen sollte nicht weitergeholfen wurde, ging ich zum Schichtleiter. Der meinte dann, die seien eben betrunken, so sei das in Clubs, ich hätte mich letztens schon beschwert weil mir einer zu nah gekommen sei und ich solle mich nicht so haben. Das großzügige Angebot vom Schichtleiter war dann noch dass ich den Tisch an einen Kollegen abgeben durfte. Dieser tat dann so als sei nichts gewesen. 

Mir wurde nicht geholfen, ich wurde nicht gehört. Ich wusste ich war nicht schuld, ich hatte einfach nur Getränke an einen Tisch gebracht. Mir wurde suggeriert ich wäre das problem, ich wäre anstrengend. Übrigens bin ich trotzdem zur nächsten Schicht erschienen. Ich brauchte den Job bis ich etwas neues hatte. Ich war angewiesen auf diese traurigen 8 euro die Stunde.

Ganz generell bin  ich selbstbewusst und bin ich Schlagfertig. Aber es geht um teils traumatische Situationen die oft schneller vorbei sind als man sie einordnen kann.

Silvi bleibt ruhig, wo ich nicht hätte ruhig bleiben können. Was die Nick da zum Teil von sich gibt konnte ich nicht glauben."
"Meine Erfahrung als 15 jährige Ferial-Praktikantin: Juniorchef um die 30 machte immer wieder Komplimente, die man lächelnd und unsicher annahm, dann einen Klaps auf den Po beim vorbeigehen, Einladungen zu Wein, die ich dankend ablehnte. 

Ich hab das nebenbei bei meinen Eltern erwähnt und war verwundert, dass mein Vater sofort zur Geschäftsleitung ging und ich dort nicht mehr arbeiten durfte. 

Erst Jahre später hab ich begriffen, dass genau dieses Verhalten des Juniorchefs übergriffig war. Und in kleinster weiße irgendwie entschuldbar."
Ich finde Desiree Nick absolut Respektlos und Verständnisslos gegenüber Menschen die nicht in ihrer Position sind.
"Jede Frau kann einfach nein sagen... 
In den Situationen in denen ich noch sprechen konnte bevor ich dissoziiert bin, wurde mein nein mutwillig übergangen und ignoriert. Egal wie laut und deutlich es war, ob ich aus vollem Hals geschrien oder nur noch vor mich hin gewimmert habe.
Auch habe ich mich in vielen Situationen körperlich gewehrt. Sicherlich konnten damit einige Menschen aufgehalten werden... aber halt leider nicht alle.
Ich bin weder körperlich schwach noch habe ich zu wenig Selbstbewusstsein. 
Trotzdem wurde ich mehrfach sexuell belästigt und vergewaltigt. 
Aber danke für die Tipps, das nächste mal werde ich einfach nein sagen und mich nicht in die Opferposition begeben."
"Frau Nick spielt ihre altbekannte Rolle. Wie immer mehr schlecht als recht, weil man bei ihr immer deutlich merkt, wie wenig dahinter steckt. Das macht eine ernsthafte Diskussion mit ihr unmöglich."
"Allerherzlichsten Dank an Caroline Rosales, Silvi Carlsson und Fikri Anil Altintas. Klasse, bin ich froh, um eure Arbeit."
"Konnte die Folge leider nicht vollständig schauen, weil mich die Aussagen von Desirée Nick unfassbar getriggert haben. Einfach nur respektlose und realitätsferne Aussagen."
"Ich stimme den Kommentaren hier zu, dass es nicht immer so leicht ist nein zu sagen. Darüberhinaus wird einem häufig auch gar nicht die Möglichkeit gegeben sich irgendwie zu äußern, sondern man wird in einer oder mehreren Hinsichten unterdrückt und da raus zu kommen ist um einiges schwerer, weil dir nicht zugehört wird. Ich finde es schade, dass dieses Argument so groß zu sein scheint. Wenn dich jemand beispielsweise sexuell belästigt, gibt dir die Person in vielen Fällen gar nicht erst die Chance überhaupt nein zu sagen geschweige denn irgendeine Entscheidung zu treffen ob du einverstanden bist mit dem was passiert. Da fällt diese Frage ""Warum sagst du denn nicht nein?"" vollkommen weg. Es gibt Übergriffe aller Art in allen Bereichen wo du lange Zeit gar nicht die Chance bekommst ja oder nein zu sagen.
Außerdem, wie schon oft betont wurde: warum müssen wir lernen in übergriffigen Situationen noch lauter nein zu sagen? Sollten nicht lieber Menschen in Machtpositionen etc. lernen sich gar nicht erst übergriffig zu verhalten?"
"44:58 ""Was nicht passieren darf, ist dass man es zur Sache der Frauen macht. Das ist grotesk. Es ist das Thema der Männer.""
Ich finde, dass ist ein sehr wichtiger Punkt."
"Man merkt wieder einmal, Frau Nick lebt in ihrer eigenen Welt. Mittlerweile denke ich, dass es wirklich hoffnungslos ist mit ihr eine vernünftige Diskussion zu führen. Sie ist so fern ab von allem, was irgendwen anderen außer ihr betrifft. Kann ihr Management ihr nicht bitte mal erzählen, was für einen Schwachsinn sie von sich gibt. Da kann man ja kaum zuhören ohne auszurasten..."
"es ist halt zu undifferenziert zu behaupten, dass man ja einfach nein sagen könnte. Wenn man Jahre lang studiert hat und dann endlich einen Job hat, den man auch machen will und mag und dann jemand, der über dir steht, dir dein Leben zur Hölle machen kann und dich im schlimmsten Fall sogar entlassen kann, dich anmacht o.ä. sollte man nicht den Frauen ein geändertes Verhalten abverlangen, sondern denjenigen, die in diesen Machtpositionen sind."
"Es tut mir so unendlich Leid,ich schaue seit 6 Minuten,aber sehe es nicht ein,mich weiter von Desirée Nick anschreien zu lassen. Ihre ersten zwei Aussagen,zeigen mir schon,dass dies ein hofflungsloser Fall ist..wer zum Teufel dachte,es wäre eine gute Idee so jemanden bei so einem Thema einzuladen???"
"Ein Kern Punkt ist, dass viele Menschen ""Priviligierung"" als Vorwurf ansehen und vor Allem Männer meinen, dass sie etwas dafür könnten. Darum geht es nicht. Es geht um ein Bewusstsein in was für einer Situation man sich befindet und daran zu arbeiten, dass sich was ändert. Nehmt das nicht als Front gegen Euch persönlich, gefrontet könnt ihr nur werden, wenn Ihr nix draus macht."
"Alle schreiben hier Desiree ist tough und selbstbewusst.. klar, kann sie ja für sich sein. Aber ich finde es absolut nicht fair von sich auf andere zu schließen, gerade da es in dieser Debatte eben NICHT um Menschen in ihrer Position geht. Ihre Aussagen in dieser Sendung sind ein Schlag ins Gesicht all derer Frauen, die anders als sie leider keine andere Wahl hatten.

Abgesehen davon, finde ich den Rest, den sie hier angesprochen hat richtig und gut!"
"Na klar, JEDE FRAU hat die Möglichkeit zu sagen: ""bitte rufen Sie mein Management an"". Sicher, ich fange als 16jährige auf dem Dorf in einer Bäckerei an und mein Chef wird übergriffig. Frau Nick will mir jetzt sagen, ich betrachte das Verhältnis einfach nicht als rein professionell, der Mann könnte ja auch mein Gärtner sein, ich wäre nicht selbstbewusst genug und um so besser, wenn mir der Mann gefällt. Völliger Realitätsverlust."
"Ich finde Silvie sehr stark. Desiree Nick hingegen hat nichts zu sagen und ich hab das Gefühl, sie will nur spalten."
"Am Ende des Tages wollen wir doch alle in einer Gesellschaft leben, wo man sich sicher fühlen kann und Spaß haben kann... egal welches Geschlecht... ich hoffe wir schaffen dies irgendwann für alle möglich zu machen!"
"Ich habe es zu Hauf erlebt in meinem Beruf als Sekretärin, dass ich von Männern einfach angefaßt wurde oder auf übelste Art und Weise ""angemacht"" wurde, obwohl ich keinerlei Anstalten gemacht hatte, was auf Zuspruch oder Aufforderung meinerseits hätte gewertet werden können. Und wenn ein Vorgesetzter mir einfach seine Hand auf den Po legt, dann ist das ja bereits geschehen, also das mißbräuchliche Verhalten hat schon stattgefunden. Ich kann dann zwar noch sagen: ""unterlassen Sie das"" oder andere Sachen, nur PASSIERT ist es dann bereits, sprich meine Sicherheitszone ist dann bereits verwundet worden."
"Silvi, gut, dass wir dich haben!"
"Desiree Nick ist so respektlos da fällt mir nichts mehr ein, aber das sehe ich bei vielen Menschen ihrer Generation und das ist sehr schade."
"Warum muss Desiree Nick  so laut und aggressiv reden? Ich sehe dieses Format so gerne und habe bis jetzt alle Themen gesehen, aber noch niemand ist so unangenehm wie diese Frau aufgefallen... Sie kann sich überhaupt nicht in die Frauen hineinversetzen, die in manchen Situationen hilflos sind und nicht wissen wie sie reagieren sollen und vor allem können..."
"Wie unsympathisch willst du sein?
Desiree Nick: Ja!"
Ganz stark von Silvie! 👏
"Ich möchte nur anmerken: die Bilder fast aller Kameras waren angenehm ruhig, bis auf die der Kamera, die die Naheinstellungen der Personen auf dem grünen Feld aufnahm. Ihre Bilder waren mir störend und ablenkend verwackelt. Da habe ich mir mehr Ruhe in der Kameraführung gewünscht."
"Frau Nick hat offensichtlich ihr Selbstbewusstsein mit der Muttermilch aufgesogen. Es gibt jedoch Frauen, die dieses Privileg nicht hatten...
Ernsthaft, ich verstehe, was sie meint, jedoch fehlt mir hier (wieder mal) ihre Einsicht, dass nicht jede Frau so charakterfest, so stark in der Widerrede ist bzw. in der Lage ist, sich verbal & körperlich zu wehren. Es gibt Situationen, wo frau vollkommen überfordert, weil überfahren wird...
Ich, ich, ich.... So relevant kann ihre Meinung hier nicht sein, es geht auch um Empathie."
Wieso fragt man Desiree überhaupt… diese Frau lebt so fernab von Realität und empathielos
Silvis Gesichtsausdruck bei min 8:18 widerspiegelt einfach genau meinen HAHAHAH
Schon komisch das der Altersunterschied der gelben und grünen Seite so hoch ist. Vielleicht ist da ja doch ein Zusammenhang zwischen der Meinung und dem Alter
"Emotionale Diskussion - ich finde es super, dass die Standpunkte und Menschen, die diskutieren, sehr vielseitig sind. Die Moderation ist super und ich glaube, dass solche Formate sehr wichtig und bereichend sind. 

Miteinander sprechen, auch wenn man nicht auf einer Seite steht :)"
"Ich denke, dass es eher die Seltenheit ist, wenn eine Frau solche Erfahrungen nicht gemacht hat."
"Desiree Nick ist so unangenehm...dass sie nicht mal anerkennt, wie privilegiert sie ist und wie sie sich dann so frauenverachtend äußert. Unglaublich! Auch die Art ud Weise, wie sie diskutiert.. muss echt nicht sein die Frau!"
"Was ich schwer zu greifen finde ist wo fängt victim blaming an und wo der juristische Unschuldsgedanke des Angeschuldigten? Nicht jede Anschuldigung ist wahr. Kommt dieses erst zu spät heraus entsteht für tatsächlich betroffene Frauen ein noch größerer Schaden, den es wird ihnen dann noch mehr Misstraut als aktuell, was wiederum in noch mehr Leid für sie endet."
"Als junger Mann bin ich tatsächlich immer sehr schockiert von sowas zu hören, dass Frauen ggf. sogar ihren Job verlieren könnten, wenn sie bei sowas nicht mit mache. Ich habe auch von Kommilitoninnen öfter z.B. Berichte über Catcalling gehört, was ja ebenfalls gesellschaftliche Verhältnisse widerspiegelt. Ich finde es auch gut, dass ganz allgemein solche Themen jetzt öffentlich(er) diskutiert werden, was vorher so nicht der Fall war.

Ich glaube aber daran, dass in der langen Frist sich die Gesellschaft dahingehend ändern wird, viele in meinem Alter, ich bin jetzt Anfang 22, sind generell für solche Sachen sensibilisiert und würden solche Dinge als Chef gar nicht mehr zustande kommen lassen. Dass Frauen für ihre Rechte eintreten, auch wenn leider nicht jede Frau dazu in der Lage ist, würde diesen Prozess natürlich erheblich beschleunigen.

Ich hoffe in gewisser Weise auch, ohne jetzt genauere Zahlen zu kennen, dass heute, also 2020+, sowas generell nicht mehr so oft vorkommt, viele Berichte und Erfahrungen dazu bezogen sich auf Dinge, die vor min. 5, teilweise erheblich mehr Jahren passiert sind und erst jetzt die Frauen dazu bereit waren darauf aufmerksam zu machen, sowas generell vielleicht heute sowas nicht mehr so oft stattfindet. Auch wenn jeder einzelne Fall natürlich einer zu viel ist.

Generell sollte man nur, dass musste ich z.B. in solche Diskussionen leider auch lernen, man wird auch als Mann teilweise in eine Aggressoren Rolle gedrängt, so geframed, als sei man selbst auch Teil des Problems. Rein strukturell mag das der Fall sein, ja, aber es trifft halt nicht auf jeden Einzelnen zu.
Ich für meinen Teil wähle z.B. gezielt den Beruf des Lehrers, weil ich weiß, dass hier solche Chef-Mitarbeiterin-Konstellation einfach nicht wirklich auftritt, sowas wie Geschäftsessen zwischen jungen Lehrerinnen und Direktoren wären mir z.B. neu. Und das, ohne mich jetzt in eine Opferrolle schieben zu wollen, die in keinem Verhältnis zu der Rolle der Frauen steht, ist halt einfach wirklich scheiße, wenn man halt Vorwürfe an den Kopf geschmissen bekommt und sich eigentlich nur denkt ""Was habe ich jetzt konkret damit zu tun? Ich war bisher noch in keiner Machtposition, werde es als Lehrer ggü. Kolleginnen einfach nicht sein, will ich auch gar nicht, und Schülerinnen leiden unter dem gleichen Machtgefälle, wie ihre Mitschüler, mal von sexualisierter Gewalt die von einzelnen Lehrern ausgeht abgesehen."""
"""Die Kardashians haben die Welt verändert und sind glaube ich meilen weiter..."" 😂hat sie das wirklich gesagt? Mein Gedanke dazu: Nein, einfach nur nein😆🤦🏽‍♂️"
"Einfach DANKE an Caroline Rosales, Fikri Anıl Altıntaş und Silvi Carlsson!!!!"
"@13 Fragen, ich finde ihr macht eine Super Sendung und ihr leistet damit echt einen wichtigen Beitrag gegen die Spaltung in der Gesellschaft. Könntet ihr mal ein Video zum Thema Psychiatrie machen? Z.B, ob schneller eingewiesen werden sollte, oder ob Zwangsmaßnahmen verboten werden sollten!? Arbeite selber in dem Bereich und habe da viele spannende Diskussion schon zu erlebt.Liebe Grüße"
"Falls es niemandem ab Minute 39:21 aufgefallen ist, Desiree Nick ist nur nicht nach vorne gekommen, da die Moderatorin das Wort „Anfang“ falsch ausgesprochen hat und man gemerkt hat, dass Desiree dies zweimal versucht hat zu korrigieren. 
Natürlich in Ordnung ein Wort zu korrigieren, jedoch denke ich dass die Moderatorin sich bewusst ist,dass das Wort „Anfang - Anfang“ heißt und nicht „Amfang“. 
Sehr unterschwellig von der Frau Nick."
"Ich glaube, was sich verändert hat, ist, dass viele Menschen sich in sozialen Rahmen eher trauen, Erfahrungen zu teilen, juristisch ist meiner Meinung nach überhaupt nichts passiert. Was ich allerdings auch oft erlebe, ist, dass gerade Männer unglaublich krass auf solche Erfahrungsberichte reagieren und sofort auf den Begriff ""Rufmord"" kommen"
"Beim Bachelor Format ist es doch so, dass Frauen sich selbstbestimmt anmelden, um, um einen Mann zu kämpfen und sich im TV zu zeigen. Wo passt der Vergleich denn in die Metoo Debatte? Das verstehe ich leider nicht :( desweiteren fühle ich sehr mit Silvi mit."
Gott es ist kaum auszuhalten was die Desiree spricht 🙈 absolut fern jeglicher Realität.
"Die Nick kann man sich auch echt nicht mehr geben. Ich habe das mal als Selbstbewusstsein gesehen, es ist aber meiner Meinung nach nur noch Arroganz. Ich finde, Silvi hat ihre Meinung stark und respektvoll vertreten und man sieht ihr an, wie schwer ihr das teilweise fällt. Der Kontrast zwischen den beiden ist beeindruckend und zeigt, auf was für ein Niveau man manchmal trifft, wenn man über diese Themen sprechen will."
"Ich glaube die MeToo-Bewegung soll vor allem das Thema sensibilisieren und wie Silvi sagt auch zu Empathie führen. 
Zumindest würde ich mir das wünschen, dass Personen in Machtpositionen selbst nun mehr darüber nachdenken, wann sie (bewusst oder auch unbewusst) ihre Macht missbrauchen, Angestellte einengen und zu dem Entschluss kommen, dass bestimmte Verhaltensweisen daher nicht angebracht sind.  Im gleichen Zuge wünsche ich mir durch mehr Sensibilität auch Unterstützung von Kolleg*innen in akuten Situationen - sexistische Kommentare und Handlungen sollten direkt als solche benannt und kritisiert werden, wenn man sie als Bystander mitbekommt. Menschen müssen lernen, dass bereits sexistische Äußerungen absolut unangebracht und respektlos sind. 

Mehr Empathie wünsche ich mir auch - es sollte darum gehen die Notlage von Betroffenen anzuerkennen und diese nicht mit Vorwürfen zu überschütten oder gar dort die Verantwortung zu suchen. Täter*innen ist egal, ob man ""nein"" sagt oder es signalisiert - wer seine Macht bis zu so einem Vorfall ausnutzt, wird sie weiter ausnutzen (""Wer wird dir schon glauben?"")...."
"Im Grunde ist doch die Frage, ob juristisch und gesellschaftlich die Unschuldsvermutung gelten soll. Ich bin der Meinung, man sollte empathisch gegenüber Allen sein und als außenstehende Person im Zweifel einfach neutral bleiben. Vorverurteilungen und Selbstjustiz in egal welche Richtung ist schwachsinnig."
"Ich finde die Diskussion sehr gut geführt und super interessant und wichtig !
So gut wie jede Partei hat super argumentiert. Jedoch fand ich Desire schrecklich unpassend. Evtl weil ich sie nach ihrem Sommerhaus der Stars Auftritt nicht erst nehmen kann in so einer wichtigen Diskussion, da sie einfach in einer privilegierten Bubble lebt und nur Ich-bezogen sich hier dargestellt hat."
"Bin so froh, dass Samra auch in dem Zusammenhang genannt wurde, habe sehr oft das Gefühl, dass er nicht als Täter und vor allem Nika nicht als Opfer anerkannt werden."
"Desiree sagt, sie könne ja Privatleben von Berufsleben trennen. Aber in der Diskussion geht es doch gerade darum, was ist, wenn es zB dein Vorgesetzter nicht kann/will. Wenn er sich einer Angestellten aufdrängt, obwohl sie alles rein professionell halten will. Was mache ich dann? Ich glaube, nicht jeder ist in der Position zu sagen „Na hören Sie mal, werden Sie mal nicht frech“ oder „Pah, dann geh ich jetzt einfach“, dann ist der Job vielleicht weg. Und nicht jeder kann das verkraften."
Sieht für mich stark danach aus das Me too auch ein Generationen Thema ist. Ist zumindest auffällig das die jungen Leute auf einer und die älteren auf der anderen Seite stehen.
Silvie war hier so stark!
"Frauen sollten viel mehr für sich und ihre Prinzipien einstehen. Ich selber schließe mich da nicht aus. Ich musste dies auch erst lernen, dass ich bestimme, wo es lang geht. Das heißt nicht, das Straftaten und sexuelle Belästigung verharmlost werden sollten. Ich wünsche aber mehr Frauen das Selbstbewusstsein von Frau Nick oder Silvi. Denn ich kann mich durchaus durchsetzen, aber im öffentlichen Raum sich zu positionieren finde ich beeindruckend!

Ich möchte nochmal unterstreichen, dass ich natürlich gegen Victim blaming bin. Nur, wenn nicht wir Frauen ganz klar die Grenze ziehen, wer tut es dann für uns!?"
"Ich bin durch das Video noch nicht komplett durch, mir fehlt aber eindeutig die Rolle der Männer. Gerade in der ersten Hälfte geht es viel darum, wie sich Betroffene verhalten und ihre Erfahrungen nach außen tragen. Diese Themen sind natürlich sehr wichtig, hier hat sich bereits etwas getan und es muss noch mehr geschehen, keine Frage.
Aber die Tatsache, dass nicht erwähnt wird, dass das übergreifende Verhalten der Männer das Hauptproblem ist, finde ich ein wenig schade. Unsere Gesellschaft, die über unangebrachte Kommentare noch mit ""Männer halt"" reagiert, ist doch eigentlich das Hauptproblem und hier hat sich meiner Meinung nach trotz #metoo noch gar nichts getan.

Wie immer super interessantes Video!"
"Klar hat Desiree Nick recht, wenn sie sagt, dass eine Frau frei bestimmen kann, ob sie mit dem Mann Essen gehen will oder nicht. Nur vergisst die alte Dame, dass nicht jeder so viel Selbstbewusstsein geschnuppert hat wie sie.
Wenn man z.b. kein Selbstwertgefühl hat, kann das ganz schön schwierig sein und es kommt zu Gedanken wie ""Vielleicht hab ich es nicht anders verdient"". Es braucht Arbeit und Geduld, um zu verstehen, dass man gar nichts muss, aber dafür muss man auch bewusst und aktiv am Selbstwertgefühl arbeiten."
"Was irgendwie nie angesprochen wird wenn es um die Unschuldsvermutung geht: die gilt für das Opfer doch genauso, jemanden fälschlich wegen etwas anzuzeigen, das er nicht gemacht hat, ist genauso eine Straftat."
alter die Frau auf der gelben Seite geht ja mal garnicht
Ralf bönt war definitiv der einzige der wirklich differenziert disskutieren kann über dieses thema
"Gute, wichtige und interessante Diskussion. Nur Frau Nick halte ich in dieser Runde für komplett überflüssig. Sie hat leider nichts begriffen, senkt das Niveau und es mangelt ihr an Empathie."
"ich bin auch in der privilegierten Position, dass ich im Berufsalltag nie in eine solche Situation gekommen bin. Im Privatumfeld hingegen schon. Daher kann ich mir vorstellen wieviel Druck auf einem lastet, vor allem als junge Person, um es dem Chef Recht zu machen. Und ich denke auch nicht, dass es von 0 auf 100 geht und der einen direkt in de Abstellraum zerrt. Ich denke eher, dass ist so über viele Wochen hinweg, erst eine Hand auf dem Rücken, dann mal ein Meeting kurz vor Feierabend und es ist fast niemand mehr im Büro, sodass man sich sicher fühlt. Und dann wird es aufdringlicher und aufdringlicher und ich man überlegt sich ""ist das jetzt schon ein Übergriff?"" Ich kann mich jedenfalls an einen Chef erinnern, bei dem ich als Praktikantin gearbeitet habe, wo ich ein ganz mulmiges Gefühl hatte. Der wollte immer die Tür schließen bei jeder Besprechung, egal wie banal. Der hat mich Aufgaben doppelt und dreifach machen lassen, nur um zu sehen wie ich mich darüber ärgere. Ich bin froh, dass ich da nach einem Monat weg war, aber ich kann mir gut vorstellen, dass so jemand Stück für Stück probiert die Kontrolle zu übernehmen. Ich komme mir dann doof vor, wenn ich als Praktikantin sage ""dir Tür bleibt offen"", dann unterstelle ich ihm ja etwas."
"Danke, dass ihr diesem Thema eine Plattform gebt! 💙"
"8:19 SILVI, ich FÜHLE es, ich fühle es!!!"
"@Silvi Carlsson ist einfach nur eine Mood, ihre Blicke und und Mimiken sind einfach nur relatable. Vor allem, wenn man weiss, dass sie mehr Ahnung hat als andere."
Themenvorschlag:Darf man auf Deutschland stolz sein?
"Mit persönlich sind in meinem Berufsleben überwiegend höfliche, aber zumindest respektvolle Männer begegnet"
"33:11 Absolut wahre Worte - sehr gut, dass er das endlich mal aufklärt: Toxische Männlichkeit vs. ÜBERmännlichkeit. Ich kann den Begriff ""Toxische Männlichkeit"", den jeder heute nur noch nachplappert, weil er ""hip"" klingt, nicht mehr hören. Männlichkeit in ihrer gesunden, ausbalancierten Form ist etwas Wunderbares, genauso wie ""toxische Weiblichkeit"" (Übersexualisierung der eigenen Person oder Gluckenhaftigkeit) etwas UNangenehmes sein kann. Männer benötigen für ein gesundes psychisches Wachstum als Kinder Liebe und Wertschätzung (wie jedes Kind natürlich) - eine starke, emotional verfügbare Vaterfigur, die dennoch liebevoll und warm ist - das wird noch viel Zeit benötigen, bis die Kriegstraumata der vergangenen Generationen geheilt sind und damit die Öffnung des Mannes hin zur Wärme und Herzlichkeit + Offenheit, über Gefühle zu sprechen, gedeihen können."
Silvi war einfach toll. Danke für deinen Einsatz!
"Eigentlich eine schöne Diskussion (finde euer Format generell super!) und viele Gäste, deren Einstellung ich trotz unterschiedlicher Meinungen irgendwie nachvollziehen konnte. Aber Désirée Nick war wirklich schwer zu ertragen. Natürlich ist es wichtig verschiedensten Positionen Raum zu bieten, nach ihrem Auftritt hier würde ich jedoch wirklich dafür plädieren dieser Frau hier  und generell in den öffentlichen Medien keinen Raum mehr zu geben. Ihre Schuldzuweisungen den Opfern von sexuellem Missbrauch gegenüber waren absolut menschenverachtend und sind ein Schlag in das Gesicht einer jeden Frau (oder Mann) die solche Erfahrungen machen musste. Sie hat die Diskussion argumentativ nicht bereichert und betreibt eine völlig narzisstisch anmutende Form der Selbstdarstellung- und Inszenierung. Es gibt genug gebildete, aufgeweckte Menschen mit interessanten Erfahrungen und Meinungen in dieser Gesellschaft, da müssen wir dieser Person nun wirklich keine Bühne mehr bieten!"
"Ich fand MeToo super. Bis der Begriff verwässert worden war und jeder schiefe Blick und jedes unglückliche Kompliment (ja, nicht jeder ist ein rhetorischer Vollprofi) gleich als ""MeToo"" hochstilisiert wurde."
"Jemandem abzuerkennen, dass man pro metoo und mehr Hilfe etc für Frauen ist, nur weil man nicht für das gendern von Sprache ist, ist absurd. Ich fand vieles von dem was sie sagte ja gut, aber sowas zeigt doch wie undifferenziert man da teils denkt."
"Schweres Thema, ich kann beide Seiten verstehen. Aber wenn ich in einem Betrieb arbeite, wo ich mit den Chefs essen gehen muss um nicht meinen Job zu verlieren, möchte ich (nur persönlich ich!) gar kein Teil des Betriebs mehr sein weil ich sowas nicht vertrete. Ich möchte 100% meinen Betrieb vertreten können und mit gutem Gewissen sagen können „der Betrieb ist sehr gut“. Sonst ist doch gutes Arbeiten nicht möglich."
danke Anil für deine starken und wahren Worte
"Das war die erste Debatte, die mir hier wirklich nicht gefallen hat. Desiree Nick ist für ihre provokante und oft sehr konfrontative Art doch bekannt, das finde ich in einem solchen Format absolut fehl am Platz."
"Frau Nick, natürlich kann ich nein sagen. Aber das Problem ist doch, dass die Frage überhaupt im Raum steht! 
Dass man sich überhaupt Sorgen machen muss, seinen Job zu verlieren wenn man nicht mit dem Chef essen geht, das das Angebot überhaupt gemacht wird, das alleinig ist das Problem."
"Laengst ueberfaellig diese metoo bewegung. Habe selbst viel erfahrrung mit solchen maennern gemacht. Schlimm ist es,wenn es den job betrifft auf den man gerade angewiesen ist. Frauen brauchen viel mehr Respekt und anerkennung"
"Für mich gibt es in dieser Debatte immer nur 2 Seiten: Sie ist doch selbst verantwortlich und hätte jederzeit nein sagen können. Oder: Sie hatte keine Chance und Männer müssen jetzt erkennen dass sie was ändern müssen mit Bezug auf toxische Männlichkeit. 

Für mich liegt die Lösung wie immer in der Mitte dazwischen: Es ist unbestritten so, dass ich mir die Situation unfassbar deprimierend und frustrierend vorstelle, durch ein Essen mit dem Chef dass in keiner Weise aus genuiner Motivation entsteht (um hier die ""harmloseste"" der im Video genannten Nötigungen als Beispiel aufzugreifen) meinen Job sichern zu müssen. Das sind Zustände die auf jeden Fall geändert werden müssen. Dennoch muss das Argument gelten können: Wenn ein Job, egal wie lukrativ, welche Aufstiegschancen und welches Prestige er bringt, Dinge mit sich bringt die so starke Übergriffe, die potentiell traumatisch sind, beeinhalten, muss die psychische Selbstfürsorge im Vordergrund stehen. Ein großes Problem in diesem Zusammenhang ist zum einen dass ein Großteil der Frauen schon im frühen Kindesalter dazu konditioniert werden, Probleme mit dem Setzen von klaren Grenzen zu bekommen. Die alten physisch basierten Geschlechterrollen sind in den meisten Familien psychologisch leider noch sehr stark ausgeprägt. Genau so verhält es sich mit dem kalkulierten Grenzüberschreiten und  Sich-durchsetzen bei Männern. Nun sehe ich ein großes Problem in dem Terminus toxische Männlichkeit. Damit wird impliziert dass die Verantwortung für ein Umdenken allein bei Vertretern des männlichen Geschlechts zu suchen ist. Man stelle sich im Umkehrschluss vor man würde die Unfähigkeit zum klaren Setzen von Grenzen als toxische Weiblichkeit bezeichnen. Für mich wäre ein Ansatz dass man schon in der frühkindlichen Konditionierung bei beiden Geschlechtern die heutigen Probleme im Auge hat und denen entgegen wirkt ohne dabei mit dem Finger auf eine Seite zu zeigen und zu sagen: Du wirst mal das Problem sein."
Das ist wahnsinnig jetzt muss man sich von einem älteren Mann sagen lassen ob Frauen belästigst werden oder nicht
"Es wundert mich, dass diesem Wahnsinn von wegen ""Männlichkeit komplett abschaffen"" nicht deutlich widersprochen wurde."
Die Schauspielerin ist ja maximal unsympathisch..
"Tolles Video, sehr wichtiges Thema. Hätte mir nur gerne die Endrésumés von allen 6 Debattenteilnehmern gewünscht. Ich finde vor allem diese besonders spannend und wichtig."
Silvi ich fühle jede deiner Reaktionen
"Wie lächerlich ist es bitte, bei einer Diskussion über Springer Machtstrukturen, Ulf Poschardt einzuladen?"
"Frau Nick macht es sich da zu einfach und schiebt die Schuld wieder den Frauen zu... nicht jede Frau hat gelernt ihre Grenzen zu ziehen und sich hier so klar zu positionieren... ich musste auch erst lernen selbstbewusst und bestimmt Grenzen zu ziehen und Männer zurecht zu weisen, wenn sie mir zB zu nahe kommen. Gerade junge Mädchen können mit solchen Dingen oft nicht umgehen und lassen dann vielleicht Dinge zu, die sie gar nicht möchten. Aber ich gebe ihr soweit recht, dass jeder Mensch und vor allem jedes Mädchen lernen sollte, diese Grenzen zu ziehen. Ich als Pädagogin kann sagen, dass die Erziehung der Kinder sich zumindest in diesem Punkt in eine positive Rihtung bewegt... Stichwort Selbstbestimmung, offnere Kommunikation über Themen wie Sexualität, Grenzen usw..."
"Desirée Nick: ""Ich würde es nicht privilegiert nennen ich nenne es selbstbewusst"" ahhhh
Ihr Selbstbewusstsein ist ein Privileg. Keine Ahnung wie ihre Kindheit/Vergangenheit war, aber wenn sie ein Umfeld/Personen hatte die sie unterstützten und ihr dadurch geholfen haben überhaupt zu einer so Selbstsicheren Person die Boundaries setzen kann zu werden, dann ist das ein Privileg"
"Bitte nicht Ulf Poschardt! Dieser reaktionäre Springer-Mann ist einfach unterirdisch, ich kenne niemanden, dessen Egoismus auch nur annähernd an seinen heran reicht."
Poschardt ist wunderbar vernünftig und gelassen. Er argumentiert rhetorisch und inhaltlich sauber. Danke dafür!
"Die Beispiele finde ich sehr kritisch, weil es noch keine Rechtsprechung zu den Fällen gibt. Das ist eine Vorverurteilung - bei der ich seit dem Fall Kachelmann sehr, sehr vorsichtig geworden bin.
Wenn es der Frau passiert ist, dann sind die Verurteilungen oft noch sehr niedrig in Deutschland. Würde mir nur wünschen, dass die Medien sich da raus halten und diese Diskussion nicht öffentlich geführt wird, sondern vor Gericht gelöst wird."
"Desiree wirkte zu Beginn sehr unnahbar, aber im Verlaufe der Sendung wird deutlich, dass das einfach nur ihre exzentrische Art/Gesprächston ist. Dazu muss man sagen, die erste Meinung die sie verkündet hat, da stimme ich absolut nicht mit überein, jedoch steht alles was sie danach sagte im Kontrast dazu. Ich finde wir brauchen auch exzentrische Menschen wie sie."
Desiree nick ist wirklich absolut unreflektiert und fernab von der Realität.
"Das scheint ein Generationen Konflikt zu sein oder? Spannend wäre mal zu schauen, wie das Bild innerhalb der Generationen aussehen würde 🤔 Wirklich tolle und wichtige Diskussion, ich stimme beiden Positionen in manchen Punkten zu 🤔"
She really sounds like she nose what she's talking about
"Couldnt prove her allegations in court so she says he ""got away with it""

Its innocent until proven guilty. Not guilty the moment a woman says something against you.

They shouldnt allow charges to even be laid without evidence. This is ridiculous."
how many woman get away with false accusations tho?
There was no evidence
Allegations are like currency to them.
"Associated Press, This is amazing! I can't stop smiling!"
No respect for anyone who picks and chooses when to speak out.
Nobody is checking for her…
"She deserves to be condemned for creating a hate movement that destroyed many innocents lives and careers. No one, ESPECIALLY w0m3n, should ever be believed off their word alone. Innocent until proven guilty."
When did they overturn  it?   I never knew.
Nose👃or knows?
The people in this comments section need to go behind bars.
Everytime i see who is the founder. I just smh..
"She looks like she gets harassed allot.



😂😂😂😂😂😂"
"Eeew, not me!!!!"
She speaks the truth
Maybe their low conversations because most are false
What about the false allegations?
expressly when women lie about it and get away with it

"Le nombre de commentaires qui essaient de minimiser les faits de viol c'est incroyable... un rapport obtenu sous la contrainte ou la menace est un viol ! Celles qui refusaient ses avancés se faisaient retirer des projets et il incitait les autres à ne pas faire appel à elles ! Quand c'est ton métier c'est un levier de pression énorme, si on vous menaçait de vous retirer vos sources de revenus si vous ne cédez pas je pense que la situation ne serait pas aussi binaire que ça."
"L'autre qui dit que c'est aux femmes d'etre forte quand il y a un frotteur ca me rend folle. Le mec qui fait ca on devrait lui couper les couilles mais non c'est a la femme de dire ""excusez moi, vous vous branlez contre ma cuisse, je ne suis pas choquée mais faite votre vie ailleurs"""

J'ai cru à tord que tu n'en parlerais pas et j'ai été agréablement surprise, preuve que tu as bien fait tes recherches !"

Un sujet clivant que tu abordes avec qualité et avec une aisance à l'oral qui nous permet de rester captivés. Tes vidéos immersives méritent d'être davantage regardées.
"Ces quelques notes au piano en musique de fond, c'est la musique de The Social Network. Je le dis parce que j'arrivais pas à retrouver d'où je l'avais entendue, donc si certains cherchent... si ça peut aider"
"Je sais pas si tu as vue le film ""She Said"", sortit en 2022, adapté du livre. C'est un super film qui brise le cœur en entendant tout ses témoignage de femme terroriser par cette homme."
Bravo! Une super vidéo comme d'habitude avec un travail impressionnant de recherche et d'écriture. Merci à toi et toute ton équipe pour tout le contenu que vous proposez
"Je viens de visionner le film ""she Said"" sur le sujet . Ta vidéo est parfaite pour illustrer le sujet et l'approfondir.Bravo"
Great video mate. A funny anecdote : in english media Farrow was given much more spotlight and had to remind people on a few occasions in his interviews that he was not the first person to uncover the story.
« C’est pas votre faute mais vous vous traumatisez pas pour le reste de votre vite » faut y aller pour sortir ça
"Salut Gaspard, ton contenu est hyper qualitatif, je sais que ça prend du temps mais ça serai possible de faire plus régulièrement des « Histoires de » ?"
Cette video etait vraiment immerssive rien a dire sur la calité du montage et la narration etait juste incroyable j atteds la prochaine video avec grande impatience!
j'aime bien parce que la femme dit que c'est aux femmes d'être forte et de dire aux hommes de ne pas se frotter mais c'est à eux de ne pas se comporter de manière si dégueulasse dans un lieux publique.
"Infiniment Merci Gaspar G
J'apprécie votre talent 
En lisant ensuite les commentaires 
Pour les précisions partagées 
Et donc Merci aussi à toutes & tous 

Avec Bienveillance & Gratitude 
Cordialement 
🤲🙏♾🙏🤲"
"Pour les curieux qui veulent en savoir encore plus sur l'affaire Weistein, il y a un film, très intéressant, qui s'appelle ""She said"" qui retrace toute l'histoire."
"Un sujet sensible, abordé avec finesse et sobriété, franchement bravo à toi Gaspard, toujours un plaisir de visionner tes vidéos et hâte de voir ce que tu nous prépare pour 2023 !"
"Une vidéo passionnante, merci à toute l’équipe pour ce travail si qualitatif !!"
"C'est super de regarder tes Vidéos Gaspard, trés intéressant ... merci à toi"
"Toujours un plaisir de t’écouter (malgré le sujet….). 
Tu as une façon intelligente précise et concise de raconter !
Hâte de voir les prochaines vidéos !"
"Super vidéo, merci de parler de sujets comme ça c'est hyper important. Cependant je me dois de faire une petite remarque, le fait d'utiliser les termes ""des comportements inappropriés envers les femmes"" pour désigner les agressions sexuelles et les viols n'est pas acceptable pour ma part. Ces comportements ne sont pas seulement ""pas appropriés"" ils sont horrifiants, ils sont interdits, ce sont des crimes. Et l'utilisation du terme ""inapproprié"" dans ce contexte est une énorme minimisation qui je trouve n'est pas négligeable. Sinon, continue tes vidéos, elles sont très passionnantes !"
"Bravo à toute l'équipe pour cette vidéo 👍
J'étais pas en France pendant cette période et j'ai l'impression d'avoir récupéré 5 ans d'infos en 10mn, et bravo aux femmes qui ont eu le courage de témoigner"
"Vidéo intéressante et basée sur l'impartialité,
merci pour ça. Je voulais ajouter qu'en France la
diffamation est rarement retenue lorsque la personne
est prise 'en grip' par les associations, comme le montage
fallacieux de France Télévision concernant l'affaire Depardieu ,
par exemple ."
"Incroyable qualité et un travail de dingue,  super vidéo merci !!! Bon courage pour la suite"
"Rappelons, à toutes fins utiles, qu’aucun de ces viols n’a impliqué de pénétration, et que 100% des actrices qui ont refusé ses avances n’ont pas été violées. Ce qui n’enlève rien au reste, notamment les tentatives d’abus de pouvoir systématiques et permanentes, mais le portrait du prédateur sexuel en question est plutôt atypique - ce qui n’est jamais vraiment clairement exposé."
"Travail de qualité ça fait plaisir, le simple placement de la pub pile au bon moment et pas au milieu d’une phrase en est exemple (oui oui c’est rare)."
"Merci pour le boulot ! Ça résume l’affaire et tes deux parties sont hyper équilibrées, c’est un plaisir à regarder comme d’hab 🫡
Par contre 7% de viewers abonnés, sachant que t’as à peu près 300.000 vues par vidéo, ça veut dire que sur tes presque 500k abonnés il n’y a que 25k qui regardent la vidéo ? Y’a un gros problème de référencement nn?"
La vérité commence à arriver tout doucement ❤
"toujours aussi pertinent et minutieux, merci pour tes vidéos !!!!"
"18:36 ''les femmes, vous êtes traumatisées d'avoir été agressées S. Bah arrêtez'' Ok merci Catherine 🥴"
"Trop bien la découverte de la chaîne, et trop bien les vidéos c’est très interessant et tu racontes bien ✨
Belle voix btw hihi"
"Trop bien ces vidéos, heureuse d’être abonnée ! Le meilleur pour la suite !"
"Excellente vidéo, c’est génial que tu parles de ce genre de sujets qui a besoin de visibilité 👌"
"Vraiment intéressant, Gaspard, j’ai apprit des choses, merci."
"Incroyable vidéo, encore !! Très bien écrit, très bien structuré, très bien monté... Bref, du grand art, BRAVO !!!
Je trouve ça bien que tu mettes les noms de toutes les personnes qui t'ont aidé sur la vidéo !"
"Incroyable vidéo, je me souviens du mouvement et en quoi il consistait plus ou moins mais très instructif, c'est bien de savoir exactement ce qu'il en ressort dans une vidéo aussi bien réalisée"
"hey ben, j'adore le format ! Super travail ! Je suis retournée par l'histoire ..."
Tu pourrais faire une vidéo sur l’explication de la guerre d’Algerie sinon continue comme ça !!
Merci pour ton travail de synthèse
Rien de mieux qu'une notification de Gaspard G. Très belle vidéo comme d'habitude
"Il y a le film ""She Said"" sortit il y a pas longtemps qui retrace aussi cette histoire sur certaines personnes veulent en voir un peu plus ! (Même si dans mes souvenirs toutes les informations que tu dis dans ta vidéo sont aussi dans le film)"
"Ton travail est d’une extrême justesse, merci de parler aussi bien de sujets aussi importants 🙏"
Une nation ne peut évoluer sans prendre en considération la moitié de son humanité.
Coïncidence énorme ! Je suis actuellement en train de lire l’autobiographie de Rose McGowan 😮
Je suis tout a fait d'accord avec avec le mouvement me too je suis collégiens j'ai été victime d'attouchements et de commentaires sexiste c'est difficile pour moi...de temps en temps je me remets en question est ce que c'est moi qui a cherché ça.. mais avec l'aide de mes parents je vais mieux et je continue ma vie normale
"Clair, propre, concis ... un très bon travail ... bravo jeune homme je te souhaite une longue vie médiatique... on ne s'ennui pas une seconde"
Merci pour ton travail toujours aussi qualitatif !
Je te découvre avec cette vidéo. J’ai hâte de voir le reste du taff fait sur cette chaîne !!
"Franchement, j'aurais jamais pensé à lui ... Superbe vidéo ! Et prochain sujet Strauss Khan !!  (DSK)"
Merci c'est toujours un plaisir!! Et très enrichissant. Merci beaucoup 🙏😊
trop bien la vidéo ça fait plaisir de te revoir!
super interessant comme d’habitude!
"C'est vrai que Catherine Millet est totalement une habituée du métro et aux frotteurs ""du métro"" ... 😂"
"Super vidéo, vraiment. C'est tellement intéressant, clair et bien raconté merciii ! ❣❣"
"Dans le cas de Sandra Muller il aurait peut-être été judicieux d'expliquer l'affaire judiciaire (encore en cours, il me semble)"
"Salut Gaspard, j'adore ce format j'ai tout regardé, je me disais qu'un épisode ""Histoire de"" sur la vie de Joseph Kessel, un homme au mille vies, ça serait super intéressant :)"
Il y a également le film She Saïd sorti il y a quelques années. Très bien fait et très éclairant sur l'affaire
"Vidéo très intéressante, bien expliquée et dynamique malgré tout ! Merci à toute l’équipe ! +1 abo"
"Claire et bien sur documenté comme d'habitude 👍. Et même quand on a pu suivre l'affaire, tu nous apprends toujours certains côtés que nous pouvons ne pas connaître.
Merci, merci pour toutes les femmes"
Gaspard je te remercie j’avais besoin pour un exposé de détail sur cette affaire tu viens de me sauver
"Gaspard, t'as pas idée à quel point j'ai attendu une nouvelle vidéo de t'as part, t'as trop tarder, mais merci pour ce que tu proposes"
"Pourrais tu faire « l’histoire de Pablo escobar » ça serait super cool.
Ps : super vidéo continue"
"Super intéressant 👌 Puis la dynamique de fin, poualala.
En theme yen a tellement mais perso sur histoire de different pays ça serait super intéressant : Genre l'histoire de la France (en plusieurs ep), le Japon, l'Amérique, l'égypte,...
Et sinon en personnage un episode sur louis de Funès, Hitler, La reine Elizabeth, tellement de possibilitées🤩
Continue commence, jkiff tes vidéos"
Enfin la vidéo que tt le monde attendait 😀
Ma nouvelle chaîne YouTube préférée ❤❤❤❤
"C'est marrant les dames boomeuses qui parlent des frotteurs dans le metro 😄 Je pense qu'à leur époque, en effet, c'était bon enfant ce genre d'évènement. Ca se voit qu'elles ne se font plus ""frotter"" à notre époque où les harceleurs s'abreuvent de porno extrêmement violent à longueur de journée.
Le mouvement metoo n'a jamais été contre les hommes qui draguent, mais contre les hommes qui dépassent toutes les limites. Le droit à la galanterie n'est évidemment pas remis en question par les victimes de viol !"
Bonjours Gaspard tu devrais une réel sur le meet Too homme qui est apparut sur X
A quand l'histoire sur Valery Giscard d'Estaing ? Pour le fun ? Ou alors George Pompidou ? Ou alors Raymond Poincaré ?
j’espère du plus haut de mon cœur que tes videos soient montrees dans les ecoles
Super vidéo moi je t'ai pas vraiment au courant de cette histoire je connaissais de bon mais bon ça sert à ça ta chaîne et c'est super merci encore pour cette histoire
Contente de te découvrir
"Salut, je t’es découvert hier et depuis je regarde toute tes vidéos ! Qualités incroyables, j’espère que tu iras très loin ! 

Ps: Un jour l’histoire d’Eminem ( j’aimerai bien l’entendre venant de toi ) 

Force à toi !"
Merci por le contenu de tes videos. Je apprendre et pratiqué mon français avec leurs
"J’adore la simplicité et l’ambiance des histoires. J’ai pensé à un sujet, je sais pas si ça a déjà été fait ou si c’est un sujet intéressant mais je pose ça la. A propos du crash d’avion du gouvernement polonais en 2010. Bonne continuation"
"Je ne connaissais pas les origines, merci  c'est bien expliqué"
"Merci pour la qualité de cette vidéo, comme toujours!! Est ce que tu pourrais parler des Panama Papers ? J'ai toujours eu du mal à comprendre cette histoire..."
"Du montage au contenu, ta vidéo est vraiment bonne. Bon travail Gasp !"
"J'ai une amie qui était actrice (Niamh Peren, pour les curieux). Elle devait jouer dans un film avec Weinstein, bien avant metoo. Une subordonnée de Weinstein lui a demandé de monter dans la chambre de ce dernier pour ""apporter le script"", ou un truc du genre. Mon amie a répondu ""the boys will do it"". La subordonnée insiste pour que ce soit elle en personne, ce qui mon amie a trouvé bizarre et donc refusé. Résultat, elle s'est tirée du film et quelques années après, metoo sortati"
Elles n’ont pas dû prendre très souvent le métro ces dames pour excuser un frotteur
"Superbe vidéo comme d’habitude, j’adore ce que tu propose comme contenue 👍"
"Vive la bien pensance ♥️
J'ai la larme à l'œil 😢"
Très bonne vidéo!
"Grand sujet, voir meme délicat. Je trouve très bien abordé et bien écrit. 
Bravo à toute l'équipe."
"Oui ! 

Encore une vidéo de notre célèbre Gaspard G 
Tu es génial, continue tes vidéos !"
Super vidéo ! Merci beaucoup à vous et à toute l’équipe pour ce travail de qualité !
Tu pourrais faire l’histoire de Angela Merkel merci sinon continue comme ça t’es au top
"13:01 ""ça marche super bien, car il est resté super longtemps""😂😂😂"
😊 jaime.
Bravo aux femmes journalistes qui ont réussi à mettre fin au agissements de ce grand pervers sexcuel elles ont rendu justice à toutes les victimes Merci Gaspard pour ton sérieux de traiter ces affaires si difficile
Passionnant… bravo. Continue comme ça! J’aime ton traitement de l’info.
Je me baladais sur ta chaine en espérant regarder une video que je n'avais pas encore vu et hélas j'avais déjà fait le tour mais miracle !  tu viens de refaire ma soirée en sortant cette video ! merci à toi et bravo pour ton travail et ton equipe qui se cache dans l'ombre !
Y a le film qui vient d arriver en streamiing
"Discours fluide, des faits chronologiques,  des sources croisées GaspardG a bien creusé son enquête"
Toutes tes videos sont franchement genial merci beaucoup
Ils savaient tous...
"Ce que j'ai retenu le plus, c'est l'augmentation des femmes battues durant la pandémie de covid. Je déteste ces lâches. Ça me rappelle la dernière violence de mon père sur ma mère. Puis grâce à notre voisine ( une mamie), tout c'est arrêté. Elle est intervenue. Il a eu un déclic. Nous ne l'oublierons jamais ainsi que tout le quartier🥰."
il faudrait qu'on évoque un jour les violences faites aussi aux hommes par des hommes ou par des femmes dans le privé et dans l'entreprise ! Mais çà reste tabou
"Ce documentaire questionne le droit des femmes. Il ne s’agit pas de mettre en conflit les femmes contre les hommes. Si vous comprenez ce docu de la sorte c’est que vous n’avez pas comprit le but du travail de ces femmes qui luttent contre les formes institutionnalisées d’inégalité des sexes. Il ne s’agit pas de diaboliser les hommes, il s’agit de dialoguer sur le rôle de l’état. Lorsque l’Etat ou le gouvernement impose aux femmes des formes de soumission (IVG illégal, impossibilité de s’éduquer, impossibilité de divorcer etc…) c’est qu’il y a quand même un problème. La normalisation de la violence conjugale et familiale ne concerne pas non plus que les hommes dans le rôle de bourreau (89% d’hommes pendant le covid, une majorité certes mais le reste ce sont des femmes maltraitantes), et dans le rôle des victimes il n’y a pas que des femmes, il y a aussi des enfants dont des petits garçons qui pourraient à leur tour reproduir le schéma en devenant maltraités ou maltraitants."
"Quand je vois à quel point la présomption d'innocence a été foulée aux pieds, je me dis que prendre un peu de recul n'est pas plus mal. 
Et puis, un peu marre de ce discours consistant à faire passer la moitié de l'humanité pour des pauvres petites choses fragiles. La femme est l'égale de l'homme ; la première n'est pas une proie et le deuxième un prédateur."
"Première phrase du magazine, premier mensonge.
J'ai du mal à croire que ces 3 jeunes femmes soient directrices d'observatoires ou de quelconques instituts faisant un travail sérieux.
Dès le début on nous les présentes puis il s'agit d'exprimer leurs impressions sur une photographie sur laquelle un homme s'apprête à frapper sa compagne .

La première d'entre elles s'interroge sur le signalement à la police de cette violence, la réaction des policiers, l'aide apportée par l'état et la société, et sur la CAPACITÉ FINANCIÈRE de la jeune femme à METTRE UN TERME A LA RELATION !!! Ce sont ses mots...
Non non, on ne rêve pas, à 3'50"" il est déjà question de laisser ses valeurs et sa sécurité de coté pour une question d'argent... Ca sent mauvais pour la suite de la vidéo.

La deuxieme ( la française en plus 🤦‍♂️), dès sa première phrase dis  "" Cette photo illustre LA réalité à laquelle la MAJORITE des femmes sont confrontées""..."" On sait que 1/3 des femmes sera confrontée à un episode de violence dans sa vie"". Voilà, ça résume le brouillard victimaire qu'on nous envoit en pleine figure.. 1/3 est maintenant devenu une majorité, et une réalité horrible et omniprésente se substitue à un instant difficile de sa vie.
Elle souhaite que l'état fasse en prévention des violences sexistes et sexuelles de la "" politique volontariste à tous les niveaux"", ainsi qu'à l'école... !

La troisime finit de m'achever à 4""55 en prononçant devant cette photo la phrase suivante d'emblée : "" Je ne sais pas comment sortir de cette situation, et même sortie je ne sais pas comment rester en vie"".. "" Comment fait'on une fois sortie pour vivre dans une société où on sait qu'on est pas soutenue par l'ETAT"", "" ça pose des questions sur le droit des femmes, la citoyenneté, la manière dont on vit ensemble..."" 

Résumons.. Dans les 5 premières minutes d'introduction du sujet, nous sommes invités à considérer la femme ( la majorité apparemment...) comme un être profondément fragile, dominée par l'homme qu'elle se choisit pour partenaire, et qui au lieut de penser à se lever et à faire ses valises, attend que l'état lui vienne en aide et la protége.
Pire, au lieu d'imaginer une prevention qui aide les femmes à être fortes, à se respecter, à reconnaître les signes de domination et à les fuir, ou à combattre le sexisme, hé bah non 🤷‍♂️ Il faut encore et toujours se poser en victime et maintenant prévenir les jeunes filles ( de leurs futures mauvais choix et faiblesses ? Nooon) que leur copains de recré deviendront de méchants garçons...🤦‍♂️

On est dans une caricature du féminisme qui fait tout sauf du bien aux femmes."
Ça commence par une systématiquement grossière du patriarcat.
Fantastique vidéo! Merci BEAUCOUP à ces femmes qui font avancer l’égalité femmes-hommes.
"le reportage part sans doute d'une volonté de bien faire, mais à 20 mins la théorie du genre ....pointe discrètement son nez, c'est furtif mais quand même, je ne savais pas que la vision genrée du monde : mâle-femelle était ""traditionnelle"" ? La biologie est traditionnelle, voir archaïque ??"
"Une approche féministe, comme d'hab. 
Jusqu'au jour où on ne sortira pas de cette logique, pour aller vers une approche vraiment neutre et anti-sexiste (ce qui le féminisme n'est pas), nous il y aura forcément des déséquilibres dans les rapports de genre."
"La vie de la bourgeoisie semble vraiment difficile, les grandes écoles et les hauts postes sont des fardeaux 🙂"
"Résistez les femmes, on est avec vous! <3"
soyons seul c'est super....méchants hommes......
J'ai la haine de ces lâches qui frappent leurs femmes et pires devant les enfants. C'est très traumatisant et on se sent minable de ne pas pouvoir sauver sa maman 💙.
"Heureusement que les hommes ne se plaignent pas, on en finirait plus avec les hashtag"
"Ce qui n'est pas évoqué ici, c'est la menace que fait peser le transgenrisme sur le féminisme. Comme par hasard, c'est un non sujet..."
"Quand on fera le proces du covid/confinement, faudra pas qu'on oublié ces victimes aussi"
"Égalité, parité, stop à la violence contre les femmes et  aux féminicides, pas de problèmes en ce qui me concerne ! Mais non aux amazones les machos au féminin. FTW 🏴"
"Dans qq années, le retour du balancier va être terrible (c'est ainsi qu' a tjrs fonctionné la marche du temps ) et ts les ""progressistes"" d'aujourd'hui vont avoir du plomb dans l'aile..."
4:09 Quoi???? Ok donc 1 femme sur 3 devient la majorité.... bravo
"Je ne suis pas sure que la constitution européenne est quelque chose à voir avec le féminisme ni d'ailleurs la protection de la femme, d'ailleurs en quoi serait t'elle concernée puisqu'elle n'a pas de valeur ni de poids de quelque manière que ce soit tant au niveau civil que dans la justice, la Pologne a interdit l'avortement, elle est pourtant bien européenne ?? non ?? la violence n'est ni réprimée ni condamnée et pourtant, elle existe, arrêtons de la nier... 
Quant on voit qu'aux états unis Trump a été élu alors qu'il débitait des ignominies sur les femmes, c'est ça le modèle de société demain ?? quand est-ce que la justice fera son boulot que ce soit ici ou ailleurs pour condamner les violences qui sont inexcusables et inadmissibles
Enfin notre ministre de la justice vient de faire acquitter son fils accusé de violence conjugale, il y a quand même des questions à se poser"
Arte et le féminisme ça devient à gerber
"Le féminisme c'est ni plus ni moins que l'équivalent du machisme. Il faut arrêter de tenter de faire passer les féministes pour des personnes plus recommandables que l'abruti qui va traiter les femmes comme des moins que rien. Ces deux types de personnes se moquent bien de vivre en harmonie et ne veulent que l'avantage pour leur sexe sur l'autre sexe. Et si les féministes arrivent pour l'instant à paraître fréquentables, c'est parce que la situation est en faveur des hommes. Et qu'elles jouent sur l'indignation pour empêcher les gens de réfléchir sur le fond de l'idéologie des féministes. Et sur le fait qu'elle implique le passage à un matriarcat et non à une situation d'égalité.

En plus d'un côté comme de l'autre, ils refusent d'admettre que la sexualité et sa mise sous couvert, ainsi que le fonctionnement des êtres humains est la raison des conflits qui existent entre les deux sexes.

Pour comprendre le problème,  il faut se poser des questions sur comment les choses se passent avec les animaux. Et quelles sont les solutions mises en place par ces derniers pour résoudre le problème des relations entre les individus de sexe femelle et ceux de sexe mâle.

Sans oublier que l'on ne relie pas le comportement des individus à leur environnement et à leur état émotionnel, sans oublier l'égoïsme naturel des individus qui n'a pas de sexe."
Merci pour cette vidéo !
"Ou là, j'ai entendu patriarcat. Ça doit être du sérieux.
Puis j'ai entendu test de bechdel, le nutriscore du cinéma engagé.
Puis masculiniste, forcément toxique. Alors que féministe forcément pas.
Perso je suis pour une patriarcat masculiniste bienveillant. 
Pour l'ecopatriarcat. Mais c'est difficile à faire entendre à des gens comme ça qu'on mène le même combat mais de façon différente.
C'est un combat sérieux, on ne peux pas le laisser aux seuls féministes."
"Quand on y réfléchit bien,  la problématique se pose de cette façon : que choisir entre une société patriarcale (avec risques de violences envers les femmes) et société matriarcale (avec risque de destruction de la famille) ? Laquelle de ces deux orientations impacte le plus notre société ?"
"Ouf, je viens de me taper les commentaires et mesdames,  je suis 100% avec vous!   Pathétique de voir mes ""camarades"" H se sentir menacés par ces propos...   Français?  😉 C'est bien le pays des coqs!  😆"
Bravo Nika ❤
"Toujours cette opposition malsaine entre l'homme privilégié, au dessus de tout et de surcroît bourreau ; versus la femme victime, privée et qui ne dispose d'aucun droit, réclamant le protectionnisme de l'Etat alors que le fémininisme prétend vouloir émanciper les femmes.
Il faudra m'expliquer comment on s'émancipe lorsque l'on réclame l'aide de l'état ?? Il y a un non sens de ce côté là. Cela montre bien que l'argent femme ne survit pas seule ou sans l'aide de qui que ce soit ou d'une institution.
De plus, le fémininisme parle toujours de droits mais jamais de devoirs. Le même féminisme ne se préoccupe jamais des enfants et encore moins des hommes même si pour faire passer son idéologie nauséeuse, le fémininisme prétend se battre pour l'égalité pour tous. Dans le meilleur des cas, sont évoquées les minorités. Mais qui sont les minorités ? Certainement pas les nains, culs de jatte, les trisomiques ?
J'ajouterai que ce même féminisme crache sur son héritage, puisque c'est cette société diabolique qui a apporté le confort dont la plupart peut jouir aujourd'hui et notamment les femmes. C'est toujours facile d'arriver ""après la bataille""... J'aimerais voir ces mêmes femmes dans la violence de conflits armées, je ne suis pas certain que leur idéologie tiendrait bien la route en cas de guerres.
Bref, c'est toujours la même soupe servie et réchauffée qui à force de traîner dans le frigo commence par devenir indigeste. Aucune remise en question non plus du comportement toxique que peuvent avoir les femmes et militantes féministes ...
Le sempiternel 15% d'écart de salaire sorti de nulle part alors qu'il a été démontré que ce chiffre est le résultat du salaire de tous les hommes en comparaison des salaires de toutes les femmes ... Il suffit de consultater le site de l'INSEE pour trouver des statistiques plus proches de la réalité. Cela n'a aucun sens... Le pompom aurait été de dire que les femmes travaillent gratuitement à partir de X date dans l'année ... Affligeant et honteux ...
Et j'apprends que les féministes ont tellement de temps à perdre qu'elles se mettent à compter le nombre d'interactions entre femmes dans un film et si leur conversation ne tourne pas autour d'un homme ... Pathétique.
Femmes, nous vous aimons, et je pense que beaucoup d'hommes dans l'histoire de l'humanité ont fait des odes à l'amour ... Et je dénote trop peu d'écrivaines qui ont romancé l'amour comme l'ont fait les hommes... Seulement maintenant ce fémininisme commence à lasser beaucoup de personnes car il tend vers beaucoup trop absurdité, de haine, de jeux de pouvoir, hommes comme femmes commencent à comprendre qu'il ne s'agit plus d'égalité, mais de renverser la vapeur pour prendre le contrôle. Ouvrez les yeux, tous."
Si vous voulez que ça change il va falloir critiquer et surtout combattre les religions tout en mettant en place une justice extrêmement punitive.
"Je suis victime d’inégalités au sein de mon couple!!!


Je suis un mâle alpha plutôt à l’extrême droite, viriliste, amateur d’arme, de muscu et de bagnole ( oui un beauf facho quoi )…qui cuisine, fait le ménage,l’ administratif, j’adore faire les courses, je m’occupe du jardin, de la rénovation de la maison, des voitures…tout en donnant de l’attention à mon épouse et mes 3 enfants.

Bref l’exemple même d’une société patriarcale…arrêtez de fréquenter des abrutis, de promouvoir le touche pas à mon pote, l’universalisme et la rencontre des luttes diverses et variées.
Quand je vois des femmes féministes, ou lgbt qui ce disent pro-immigration….les cultures qui arrivent avec votre bénédiction vont vous faire mal et pas uniquement à cause de la largeur du tibia de Girafe présent ds le caleçon."
"et les racines du mal? les religions, par exemples...hum? pas un mot? what!!"
Empoisonnement dans les ecole 😡😡😡????
Et maintenant ? y a plus rien !
"Comment trois personnes issues issues de la bourgeoisie et d'un milieu aisé, représentant des clichés pro occidentaux qui ne sont que le résultat d'un passé révolu et qui n'a plus lieu d'être peuvent représenter des pays culturellement très différent, avec des communautés diverses etc. peuvent se rejoindre avec un langage commun... ?!?!
C'est vraiment du foutage de gueule et du délire !?!? 

Et Alien... C'est le symbole du viol et du phallus...! Est ce que ce que vous pensez est mieux ou plus juste que l'avis de l'auteur, les acteurs etc ?!? ..."
"c'est très bien metoo ça obligera les femmes a faire le premier pas de la séduction 😝
les dragueurs relous finiront en prison"
Après meetoo ... Le retour de baton😂😂😂😂 c est beau ..
"Il faudrait aller plus loin dans la guerre des sexes, c'est trop mou !"
❤❤❤
Quand on n'envoie pas de coups de bâton on n'a pas à craindre le retour de celui-ci
"16:40 Ca me fait toujours rire les militants qui se plaignent que les militants opposés à eux diffusent leur idéologie en s'organisant

Les féministes ne font elles pas des campagnes de diffamation ciblées sur les réseaux? En étant organisées..?"
"A 22mins30 : les problèmes écologiques ?! Le reportage passe par : les violences conjugales pdt les covid, à la situation Iranienne qui est générale et dont toute la population souffre, au droit à l'avortement (?!), aux droits des minorités,  aux droits à la liberté sexuelle (?!) sous entendu de la liberté individuelle sans entrave MAIS SURTOUT  sans être responsable de ces actes : Du coup il faudrait qu'on explique aux féministes comment on tombe enceinte car en 2023 ce n'est toujours pas clair pour elles..... et Nous voilà par une pirouette dans l'écologie et les pénuries d'eau en Iran .....ok..."
"Mettre sur la même plan l'interdiction de l'avortement qui une excellente chose car c'est un meurtre odieux contre l'islamisme des talibans c'est hyper déplacé...

Bref ce reportage est un ramassis de mensonges et faux problèmes"
Par contre la plupart continue des école ministère continue de manger de viande... et perpétré l'exploitation animale notamment les femelles animales c'est choquant .
"Ne vous faites pas niqu... par arte ""de grâce""."

"enjoy your cats women, we aren't EVER gonna approach you EVER again. No single bars, no tinder, no office parties, no supermarkets, no, no, no. We are out."
#No proof no justice  ... see anyone can make a hashtag
"In reference to what she says at 0:50. No, it's not easy to pick apart lies because you're not allowed to question these people's stories. Also having a society that wants to believe isn't helping things."
MGTOW. Leave women alone and keep yourself safe.
"Although men are the root of this problem, if you don't include them in the conversation and discuss the differences between what Franken did, vs Wienstien, vs Trump. and the difference between inappropriate and illegal, you're not going to make any real progress."
I heard fear and panic in the black lady's voice. She is a liar
So no Guys in on the discussion then.
"i took the red pill...employers will simply shut the door and not hire any woman due to the risk of a  sexual harassment charge, you might say they will sue you for discrimination charge, but they will simply pay that small fine, which will save their company, the bosses job, life etc... i am making popcorn and going to watch this ride. buy more cats, i sell cat litter."
Yes this will be used for revenge eventually it's a matter of time
MGTOW for life
What do you mean botching it? The attention is completely off child actors now. It's working perfectly.
"Economics beats politics every time.

I see that men won't have a hard time getting a job I  2018."
"The problem with the ""hashtag metoo"" movement is that it ignores a basic reality: there's always at least two sides to every story, and we're basically only hearing one side of each story.

If msnbc wants to stop being largely a target of cynical laughter, perhaps it could start covering both sides of each story. That was what was once called journalism."
"Every single sexual misconduct accusation needs to be investigated. The problem I see is, ""hit and run"" journalism. Let's make the initial report, follow the ""me, toos"", but let it all drop for the next flavor of the week and the conclusion of the incident goes from front page to a byline on page 12. People need to know that there are consequences for their actions. In Franken's case, unlike Moore, there is no one jumping on the situation because of the rampant sexual impropriety that happens in Washington daily. Just do a little research. Just the publicized incidents in this century number around 80."
"Differences:  Adult/child; consent/non-consent; power disparity; threat (actual, implied, assumed); severity; frequency; timing ➡️ Apology/forgiveness; restitution; lose power/role; (real) rehabilitation; imprisonment?

- Should s/he pay restitution for causing damage?  “Preponderance of the evidence” or “Which side has better evidence?” (judge/jury)
- Should this person be our babysitter, teacher, pastor, senator, etc.....(People use all available info and their best judgement to select best candidate for the position and responsibility. NO judge or jury.)"
"It is time that companies are held responsible and are being fined if they let men be alone with women, or let men ride elevators and such alone with women. If a man is left alone with a woman, the woman should be able to sue for endangerment - no matter who the man is.

There need to be large signs in every elevator and hallway warning men from being alone with women."
"When you accuse someone of something serious, you should have your ducks in a row so that you can actually bring the wrongdoer to justice (and not just to get attention, which some people will do). Anything can go too far and be used for ill. I think denying that is either irrational, or disingenuous.

I think it's important that this is done correctly, otherwise it won't accomplish what it should.....and the unintended consequences will be catastrophic. Great Video."
Who do we know women won't be accused of sexual harassment
"This is GOOD PEOPLE vs BAD PEOPLE, not boys vs girls. Remember. Now comment."
Ms Charles nailed this issue.  You CAN’T be “strategic” about how and when to tell your story.  You MAY get lost in the “white noise” but THAT should NOT be the point?  The Me Too movement is offering HOPE to abused women AND men.  We can only hope and pray that America “listens” and ACTS accordingly
This movement was botched from the beginning.
The Aziz Anzari story is a nail in the coffin for the poor me movement.
No -one questions them. Doubting accusations is a crime in itself. Keep away from women.
"I will be doing my part. Quitting my job next week. Working nights in a shop with a woman. Nope, find someone else."
"Name and Shame. If a congressman, pays out, it should be transparent and accountable. No non-disclosure-agreements for people found guilty or harassment!"
"This will not be forgotten for decades. Decades. The Salem Witch Trials were caused by a few little girls telling tall tales; this movement was a concerted effort by thousands of adult, educated, liberated women. I look forward to watching women slowly realize what they've done."
3rd wave feminism and the pound metoo movement has caused many men to go MGTOW.
"wait i thought we weren't supposed to investigate the allegations and just ""believe women""? so how do we tell if an allegation is fake or true? do we investigate or not?"
So women are suddenly going to stop trying to attract the rich guys? Women are going to be excluded from everything they do that's inappropriate?
Questioning? What questioning? What interrogation? I see allegations and then a guy loses his job. Listen & believe is the mantra. The accuser should be questioned & interrogated....but currently that is not the case.
You would think that every other man is a sexual harasser. It's like the red scare of the fifties.
Did the lady just say 'men' and women? Hahaha do u smell the fear!
"Most people don't do it for good reason. It's not worth it, i.e., let the guilty throw the first stone."
These women are delusional. #Metoo HAS overreached with Ansari. Men will no longer interact.
"Im so glad that women, who are so emotionally driven that they will go too far...This will backfire to set back women 100 years UNLESS they own their own businesses."
"""When women and men"" lol bc men are coming forward in the 10s of thousands"
Good riddance # Me Too
Their going to stop hiring women then what will be the complaints?  If it's harassment then file your complaint but the backlash will soon be evident.
"I consider myself resonable and would he willing to discuss the problem, I am not and have never been an abuser, I wouldn't even date coworkers when I was single, and as a Manager never even let my mind go there with a subordinate, or let myself be in a compromising situation that could be misinterpreted. I must say the attitude expressed by some would shut the conversation  down, I would stop listening, and no progress would be made, and I'm a man willing to say there is a problem with some men and the treatment of women."
"too much politics, just create your own business, done."
"What are women going to do when men have had enough and put them back in the kitchen? They are not equal and the only reason women are in the workforce is because men allowed them to be. Basically it was so you could have 2 incomes in the family. However, if more men are going to stay away from women, there is no reason to keep them in the workforce. There is nothing a woman can do that men can't, but a ton of jobs that only men can do or do better. Don't believe me, go outside and look around. Your home, roads & bridges, buildings and cities were all built and maintained by men."
Ya think?
Yeah they will ruin you when they lie and its  ok and man up lol
I work with women all the time it's just in my line of work . I'm a cna I take care of the elderly.  I've never had a problem but there are alot of witnesses everywhere and I guess those I work with are good people and don't lie like that anyway
"Is it me, or does Chris Hayes at the end of these MSNBC videos sound like he's saying ""Just Blow Me""... Ironic?"
yep they want to get alllll tha kings men
Ruhie that what I and American wants to hear the millions of tax payers money and why can't they pay for their play moments That might be a set up job let them pay for there own problems we do.
Women talking about men nothing new
#metoo$$
She is such a talented singer . So sad because of such men they have to face this .
Bold Lady I am proud of her. Shameless singing fraternity Sr singers like chitra Spb were also quite
She is a strong woman 🔥
Tere bina by chinmayee... We needed more of her

How come such men escape punishment?
Don't leave this who men
Same problem hindi music industry also faces ...mostly Bongs like Abhijeet bhattacharya ..
When she speaks hard to think she has such a beautiful voice when she sings
Bring him to the justice
"Why Annamalai is quiet? Is it because of wrestlers in Delhi? Why Kushboo NCW Member is silent? Why Southern Artists Artistes are quiet? How Hindu Frontline are silent? What Mr Ram has to say?
What MP Kanimozhi has to say? 
Ministry/Deptt dealing with women's welfare is silent. SC has to take suo moto action. Intellectuals in Tamil Nadu should follow up. POCSO has to include ladies also. It should be straightaway a cognizable non-bailable offence. Proof of innocence should lie on the molester, rapist.

S.Shankar Ghaziabad"
Courageous ❤
Chinmayi the 🐐🎉
Super voice

No mom would let an abuser  6 feet within your daughter. Who is he fooling? Was her mother a brothel owner who will ignore daughter’s plight?"

Getting in trouble for keeping distance from women is Far better than getting in trouble for sexual harassment
I love how the misandrist just lets her toxic femininity breathe. Men getting falsely accused of sexual assault are literally by all over the place. But hey it's so small and negligible meaning it doesn't exist whatsoever.
One of the craziest ways to have your life ruined is by having a female colleague show interest in you and then you decline out of being professional. They really don't take rejection well.
"I rather not be in the 2%,so don't fault me being extra careful."
Let's say there were a bowl of M&Ms and I told you that only 2% were poisoned. Would you eat any?
"their empathy for what amounts to mental health issue for the men is amazing. Men feeling stressed, and fear in the work place, and they could not care less. overwhelming number of workplace suicide are men, and their advice is just get over it."
#metoo has been the greatest recruiting tool for MGTOW.
Feminists have proven they can be dentrimental to men’s jobs and well being.
"It's not about false accusations. It's about ""he flirted with me once now i will ruin his life""."
"So the 2% is supposed to mean, ""Don't worry - if you're accused, there's a 98% chance you're guilty and your career is over."" We should all feel better now."
"My chances of dying in a car crash are less than .02%, but I still wear a seat belt."
"Never take advice from a woman about how to act around other women. 
Just avoid them all."
To claim 2% is an outright lie. Sexual harassment is the one crime where the accuser is also judge and jury.
"Well she failed to mention that sexual harassments claims are almost always entirely  based on testimony.  Meaning that regardless of guilt, the accusation is more than enough to result in dire life ruining consequences for the accused.  Funny this lady precludes that fact from her argument.  Thus, mens refusal to be alone with women under any circumstances is a very rational and pragmatic response to the current situation."
2%?!    GTFOH
If a man is in a room with a woman for a few hours working and afterwards she accuses you of harassment let's say because of a misunderstanding or her lying the guy is done for. He did nothing but just the accusation will destroy him
If your in the 2% innocent collom it can destroy your life so yeah it's not as easy as it sounds.
I love how feminists sit there and claim that they are trying to help everyone when all of the policy they create so clearly favors women.
Your statistics are extremely questionable.
Save yourself. Play it safe and don't even tempt fate by being alone with a woman you work with.
"Wow, men are afraid of being falsely accused and you people say they are panicking, should learn how to behave and that they are committing a crime.
Jesus, what a way to make things worse."
2% naaaaa more 99.9 % when shes in her period of false accusation
"You can't force male managers to mentor female employees  and it isn't discrimination to use the mike pence rule
God bless Mike pence and Billy Graham"
"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice  ...."
2% is just the ones where the guy could prove his innocence. What about the false accusations where the man couldn’t prove his innocence? It’s definitely higher than 2%.
"Most men wouldn’t even speak to a woman at work, let alone ask them out. I’d rather be single and keep my job than get #MeToo’d."
Mgtow shield wall is up
"I'm an employer of my (and another person's) company, and we both specifically avoid hiring women for numerous reasons, one of them being the false accusations of sexual harassments.  Yes, we accept applications from women due to legal reasons, but we haven't hired even one female employee in the 11 years the company ran.  It's just not worth it, unless the female applicant has some really impressive resume (they don't, since high level women don't apply to small companies like mine)."
According to these two it's once again Men's fault. Way to go blaming men for every problem.
That's the proof that woman really think that nothing is ever their fault 🤣
"my brother who works in a small IT company in NC told me he is having trouble finding a gf, so I told why not ask one of your coworkers out, and he told me he would never do that because one of his male coworkers asked a female coworker out, she causally told him that she is not interested and he replied ok and never talked about that again, a week later he receives a mail from hr that he is being fired for making sexual advances at workplace... ofcourse men are terrified of women, that guy drives for doordash now as he was unable to find work anywhere else"
"Love the shaming language Wymyn insist on using. Man ""scared"". No actually Men are SMART for avoiding them."
I have a bowl with 100 skittles. 2 are poisoned. Would you eat the whole bowl? Nope. Not a chance.
"This video is beyond stupid. They completely missed the mark here. Good job guys! 
😂👏👏👏😐
Just wow."
"That woman just lied.  False Sexual assault claims may be at 2%,;  but sexual assault and sexual harassment are not the same thing.  Women claim ANYTHING as harassment..."
I want a law that gives men the right to wear a body cam at work or to force employers to install video and audio recordin equipment in every work space except the bathroom obviously.
Feminists the greatest recruiting tool for MGTOW.
The problem with citing FBI data is that it keeps track of accusations which go through the legal system. They aren't keeping track of false statements in HR complaints.
"Okay, say I'm a man, now you are telling me that almost all accusations of sexual impropriety against men are true (98%)
So I should have no reason to worry about interacting with women, after all, why would any woman want to hurt me?
This is truly chilling."
"Sure, I trust the FBI, just about as much as I trust NBC.........so long."
Why do Women need to be mentored by Men Where are the feminists
Men are afraid that they are going to be falsely accused of inappropriate behavior after women falsely accuse men of inappropriate behavior? I'm SHOCKED! SHOCKED I say!
Notice that they are not citing any law against refusing to be friendly to women colleagues?
"Keep them away from me.

#NOTME"
The point is that 2% of false allegations is very high. You do not want to be the one guy that has to deal with the 50th woman that has the power to destroy your life. You’ll be guilty until you can prove to be innocent. You cannot defend yourself and be fired. Stay safe. Never have meetings with only one woman. Always have witnesses.
"suing a man for rapr after 5+years should not br allowed if the ""victim"" was an ADULT when it happened."
"It’s the fact that man don’t want their behavior to be taken as flirting or harassment simply by talking to you how they would talk to any other friend, it seems like a lot of women especially in todays society feel men are always trying to “get with them” but that’s not always the case. Also if something was to happen and she falsely accused you it’s her word against yours and NOBODY is believing what you say over a women especially now so men just avoid interaction altogether."
"As an outsider and having seen how the FBI at work the past four years.  I would only trust them to give me the correct time, twice a day, with a broken clock!"
So the best solution is have companies with only females and companies with only males and let see which company can last more than 1 week
Male managers should not have 1-1s with women PERIOD.
"You're very hungry and handed a bag of 50 peanuts but told there is one peanut in there (2%) that has a neurotoxin which can make you violently ill or leave you paralyzed - are you going take a chance and eat some? Not likely.  That's what men face with interacting with women in the work place - it's not about being "" afraid "" it's about taking sensible precautions to safeguard their jobs and reputation."
Men keep protecting your self.  Cameras / witnesses
"wow... just wow...
people are worried. and we should blame them for being worried eh?"
It is their choices whether men will mentor women or not. You can't say that this is crime or violation. All women betray men when their needs are fulfilled by men like mentoring.
I'm not afraid to work with women because Im unprofessional. I am afraid because the accusation is all it takes.
mgtow around the world is holding the line
2:02 - men are even get punished now for being afraid. This woman is insane.
"Did all men hear that? Its illegal to avoid women. Any tickets left for flight to Mars, I'm going home."
One false accusation is one false accusation too many.
Nope! We are tired of being accused and having lives ruined over baseless accusations.
so fear is illegal now? we know that any accusation will be unconditionally believed and your life will be destroyed.
"Can someone explain why so many people disliked this?

Edit: Maybe because these people are undermining the power of women who can easily use this power to blackmail men or ruin their life?"
Has to be higher than 2% false claims - I know several and they were all false
she is more threatening calling out laws and forbidding men to say no...
"Know what else is illegal? Making a false accusation. Didn't stop these harridans, now did it?"
She said only 2% - the fear is being in that 2%
"""There is a clear line"" proceeds not to talk about where this line is precisley. And  feminist won't ever define it because that would mean there would be gender roles."
"How's this fair, women basically pointing a weapon to men's head do whatever I say and when we try to avoid you, you try to get us in trouble pulling us into your issues.
Lose lose situation how is that fair?"
"Ok. I've been hearing alot about the work environment. But what I haven't heard about is the damage in every other area of life. And I have only heard about ""white males in power."" But what about your average middle class men who do have moral compasses who have been taught to respect women but they fear that one mistake and they'll be stripped of everything? You can't be so laser focused on a crusade that you don't pay attention to who gets hurt in the process. And don't even get me started on the dilemmas that BLACK men face. Me Too has done many good, and I support women demanding to be put on the same platform. But the the movement has single-categorized everybody. There is a difference between those that feel they're entitled, invincible, & untouchable and those that are human beings and have errors. They shouldn't suffer. We can't overlook the damages that Me Too caused."
"“Breaking the law.”?

Seriously, GFY."
"(Sigh) Being lectured again!!? Ladies, this is what you wanted, you caused the damage, can't change your minds now. Oh, and by the way, 2% false accusations is way off, the number of false accusations is much much higher. Also, notice the subtle threat of it being ""illegal"" to avoid women in the workplace. Gawd!! They just won't stop!!"
"My employer refuses to hire female employees.
I love working in this environment"
It’s not backlash it’s self preservation ya women did it to yourselves.
This is completely not true because as a 15 year old I was accused and it broke my world and how I saw it and as a male this is one of the many things why I have trust issues at a young age.
"for the sake of argument, even if there are only 2% false allegations, that 1 in 50 chance will nuke a guy's career and forever smear his reputation. you would never jump out of an airplane if there was a 1 in 50 possibility the parachute would not open."
"I just don't want to be in the 2% , is that too hard to accept?"
If you are a woman or a man who wants a relationship with somebody from work you already know instead of dating strangers you don't know you are out of luck because trying in even the vaguest of ways is prohibited.
I don't even look at woman anymore.  Lately there's nothing much too look at and nothing upstairs either.  I rather ignore  this little group all together.
I think that 2% statistic is bull
2% of false accusations does not look that bad until you fall in that category
"I don't think men and women are made to work together. Traditionally, men worked with men and vice versa. Go to the oilfield and it's all men and there are never many issues. As a maintenance technician at a hotel, I found that the dynamic with so many women around became a problem for me with advances, drama and jealousy. This led me to seek jobs far away from an office. I prefer working with men only or solo as the drama is almost nothing. No need to tip toe around people's insecurities or feelings in those environments. Risk of getting into legal trouble is almost nothing as well."
2% its really 90%
"Organization isn't going to help men, when someone falsely accused..."
"Interact with women in your workplaces only when needed. Otherwise you're better off avoiding them. After work, don't even think about hanging out. If you need to work late, make sure a camera is recording. You'll thank me later."
"Tell me, cultural historian Lynn Parramore or company leader Gene Marks, or anyone else who made the claims in this video: If I, as a man, lose my job and my ability to get future jobs because my reputation is shot by a false report of sexual harassment - one which *will* destroy my reputation, for sure - will you be able to offer me a job? Or support me through any legal trial that takes place, at least monetarily? Work to help clear me of such false accusations? Or will you just wash your hands and say, ""F it, he's just one of the 2% who got nicked and let the courts decide if he's guilty""?

Heck, do you even walk the talk you make? Because, beyond the facts and figures, our lives are on the line here."
"A false accusation doesn't need to be taken to court have you ever dealt with a crazy ex? You all talking nonsense.  

They aren't refusing because they are women, they are refusing because of potential lawsuits even when innocent."
The Bret Cavanaugh case minimized the #metoo movement!
"Anyone who doesn't take steps to mitigate risk is just asking for trouble. If you let your guard down and make any sort of a comment  outside the strict bounds of work related topics it will come back to harm you eventually. Women hold grudges, they look for lapses, they look for anything that might serve as a weapon they can use maybe not today but when it works to their best advantage.  Do not take a meeting one on one with a woman. Never close the door when meeting with a woman. Never travel with a woman. Never dine alone with a woman. Dating is dating and work is work. Never confuse the two or assume that a woman can be trusted not to screw you over if it advances her interests. Personal experience talking here."
Nice try with this trap. Not buying this. Men stay on point and don't give in. Stay away from the women in the work place. Don't even look at them.
"5 years ago in my early 20s I would have loved to hire women. 

Now in my late 20s I would never. Never. Ain’t that funny?"

"Nate Parker of ""Birth of a nation"" was a man that was vindicated 15 years before the movie came out. He was found not guilty and proven innocent. So interesting that that case was brought up right before the release of birth of a nation just as his career was jump starting. They wanted him to apologize or have sympathy for the victim that falsely accused him. He did not have to show remorse for something that was traumatizing for him and almost destroyed him. The end result? He no longer in Hollywood. No studio will touch him. Stay away from women in the work place."
"Don't marry them, don't hire them, don't work with them. Protect yourself"
A simple gaze can make her 'uncomfortable'....and make you lose your job
2%? ..... Make that 98% False accusations
"I know this will happen, all men should be respectful and careful."
"So you will still be overreacting  when your in jail for 10 yrs for  a crime, without evidence."
"2% of false r*pe accusations is already too much . a friend of mine got falsely accused of that years ago. it has traumatized him to this day . i don't like the way this woman is downplaying it , not to mention the veiled threat against already anxious people that they may face the law . my advice , when you start your company , pick in advance your entire staff , this way you cannot be blackmailed to hire anyone you don't want to hire /"
"W*men want work to be a social club or dating service when it suits them but use $$$metoo when things don't work out. Well, FORGET IT!"
I would be! Man Hating lesbians everywhere...
I'm staying single.
The word... 'Mgtow' is getting closer to mainstream conversation
"""Women waiting for men to make the first move""
Men: that's gonna be a long wait."
"Men are more reluctant to approach women.
Even I am and I used to do it a lot. 
You did it to yourselves ladies."
At 48 years of age and retired. I'm just sitting back and enjoying the slow demise of western society.
"I think it's funny how everything is the man's fault, never the woman's fault."
A man can't lose in the dating game if he never plays!!! MGTOW has grown in recent years because of the #MeToo movement.
MGTOW more popular than ever. Good job women!
"Thanks but no thanks, I'll be staying single and protecting women from my toxic money."
A man who truly loves his children will NOT conceive them into a world like this. Keep them inside fellas.
"I was at Aldi.. when I saw a woman struggling with her arms filled with groceries,  I had a cart with a  bag of potato chips,  I offerd to help her,  I knew that I  was wrong from the moment I opened my mouth..she told me exactly where to go, I will never help, or offer to help, another woman as long asI live"
"This is the sad reality to life, where women always expect a change in their men but want their men to accept them for the person they are. Women want to get treated like queens with out treating their men like kings...we make everything about our women we empower our women only for our women to compare themselves to us men and want the same treatment as a man. There's a reason a man is called a man and a woman is called a woman, what the world needs to stop doing is comparing the struggles of a man to the struggles of a woman, our struggles are not the same"
She's right about the part '...but women aren't willing to change' .
"If men are saying they want more women to make the first move, then why are women complaining men aren't being more assertive?  ...in this era of the ""liberated woman""?
Hmmmm??"
"Dating is dead.
Marriage is dead.
Birth rates are crashing.
48% of all newborns are to single mothers.
Good luck trying to reverse these trends with VAWA, The Duluth Model, YesMeansYes, femcorrect diversity hiring and promotion quotas and then piling on MeToo.

Before it was ambiguous and people could laugh it off.
MeToo has removed all of the masks.
Now there is no question that women now represent a massive legal and financial liability and risk to any man, and to any business as well.
Thing is, how can women undo the damage already done?
They can’t put the genie back in the bottle such that men will be sacrificial and deferential all over again."
Now alot more women can grow old with their cats !!!!
Keep a close eye on those birth statistics. Should be interesting.
"""Why don't men open up?""
Men opened up and we got ""Muh emotional labor"".
""Why don't men discuss their issues?""
Men approached you with times they were abused and we got Johnny Depp.
""Why don't men approach anymore?""
Because you said feminism was destroying harmful gender roles and because we got metooed."
Gillette's commercial said that guys shouldn't talk to women.
I changed my behavior to avoid women altogether. Worked like a charm. I have money and mental health now.
It's caused many men to start looking overseas for partners. The western women seem to have become overly sensitive.
"I just quit asking women out.

Problem solved.

If a woman doesn’t ask me out, I don’t go out."
"I lived by these rules all my life before this movement and it served me well:

Never initiate physical contact with a  woman. Let her make the move.

If you're alone with a woman like a coworker, make sure there is either a 3rd person present, the door is open or it's in public. 

Wait until she makes the first greeting."
"I'm indian before this movement my parent's advice ""don't go alone with a girl"""
"Women:   The wage gap is unfair !   Equal pay equal work !
Also women:  I want a man who earns more than me, and I refuse to settle for less.
Also women: There are no good single eligible men out here for us !"
You are correct for more than just dating culture. I stopped dating and my hiring practices have changed drastically. Once you realize that you don't need women. You will realize that your need for material gain disappears and you'll find yourself doing what you want without being held back by a modern materialistic women.
"It was too late before I figured this out 😂 got kicked out of college for looking at a girl I didn’t even remember her face. She said she felt threatened for a whole week 😂😂 and I don’t even remember her face. 

Good job women gooooood job"
Look up Mgtow on youtube. Then you'll understand.
I will never get married. I don't want to lose all of my savings to divorce lawyers.
"The later you marry, the more likely it is you stay married? How do you figure that? Almost everyone in my parents generation have been divorced at least once in their lives and their parents, the generation that saw marriage as a holy oath, actually stayed married until death and they usually got married in their early twenties.."
SINCE I BECAME MGTOW  MY BANK ACCOUNT HAD AN INCREASE OF 300%  IN LESS THAN A YEAR. I AM LOVING IT.
"How men have changed their behavior:
They avoid women at all costs out of fear of being falsely accused or misunderstood what the woman was thinking in her head.
Congrats."
"I'm part of the 51% of men who have changed their behavior. Never will be alone with a female who is not close family. Never will give assets to a female who is not close family. I assume that a little over half of all single women are infected, and all are willing to make false accusations if they disapprove of anything I say or do."
"Women will be all alone, more vulnerable and more miserable in the future. Riding the CC until 35 and then asking the question ""Where are all the good men gone?"" isn't going to help anyone."
"The laws are crap, don't get married, and don't help women when they can't breathe, if you give them CPR, they'll sue you for assault."
I love it. More and more men avoid  the bad contract called marriage.  Great news.
"""Women waiting for men to make the first move"". Men: What move?"
Yeah i don’t even speak to female humans anymore I’m not trying to get accused of anything.
"She's sugarcoating men losing interest. There is no light at the end of the tunnel for women, but there is for men. Men are being more productive, and women are needing men more than ever. Feminism has really backfired. The more things change, the more they stay the same. We're becoming a different kind of tradcon."
"I agree...let women send me flowers, chocolates, ask my number, ask me out for a dinner and explain to me why I should date them sacrificing my time and energy and I will consider if I will accept her invitation or Friendzone-her...until I will be asked out I can enjoy my good time alone...."
We're not being reserved out of respect for a woman.  We are reserved because we now have the fear of being socially and financially persecuted.  Metoo has achieved its goal but the outcome is extremely one sided.
"I thank the Lord I was born in the 70s . I am happily married for 18 years...
Nowadays a woman can ruin a man with false accusations . Even when it is proven that the woman lied , nothing happens to her."
"MGTOW, an understandable response to Feminism & the ""Me too"" movement. Congratulations ladies!"
About 8 years ago I remember telling someone that because men are all assumed pedophiles by society I no longer acknowledge  the presence of children unless they speak to me first or are with an adult. And if I find myself alone in a room with one I leave that room. I've  since adopted the same policy regarding women.
"This woman is not even trying here. Her male colleague asks how and what changes, and we get her own random postive interpretation. He asks if it's an OVER correction, and she erases the word over in her reply directly. Wtf, can she not hear him correctly or just that deluded?"
Women are being manipulated to believe that movements such as the MeToo are good. The result is simply that no business owners managers want to be alone with a women anymore. The risks are just great when compared to hiring men.
"It's not worth the risk ,MGTOW"
My financial situation prevents me from finding love too. I like to keep my money!
"No wife, happy life."
Doesn't affect my dating life.  I'm a misogynist.
I love they interview a woman to describe man's positions.
Don't be surprised if the number of babies born this year falls exponentially. #WeAreDone

This is excellent advice for women. Hear that ladies? Wait until at least your mid 30s before you even consider marriage. Because there's nothing that men love more than older women who have had multiple sexual partners. I just can't figure out why marriage rates are at an all time low. Hmmmmm🤔
This didn’t age well.  Marriage rates and birth rates are way down.
Mgtow!
"Dating has definitely changed.  When I go out women hit on me.  Maybe it’s because I have a home by the beach.  But I don’t say that.  I don’t even take dates to my house.  I take them to a studio apartment I rent month to month.  I don’t take my nice car either and I won’t be a simp and take them to nice restaurants.  Maybe they think I’ll pay off their student loans 😂 Nope to that too.  I’m free and not going to ruin it.  I retired at 49, home is paid off.  No car payment, no credit cards.  If I want to work I do.  Then I go on vacation a few months."
"By changing the way men date, you mean gave up, right?"
"If men are so wrong or inappropriate, let women do all courtship and work in dates. Let them make the first move, let them make conversation interesting, let them work hard to get a man, let them propose and get rejected. Let them teach us the ""right"" way. Men are not acting more inappropriately, they are just slowly starting to NOT ACT at all. Get it through ur thick heads."
"Well congrats feminists

You’ve ended human interaction entirely :)"
MGTOW REDPILL PROTECT YOURSELF.
Women get upset when men approach them but are too scared to approach men. Can you say falling fertility rate? A society with this dysfunction will be out competed by other societies in population growth.
"So You're Asking a woman about man's issues?
Nice 
😂😂"
"I'm 44, and women caused me a lot of stress. I like women but not the hurt and pain behind it. I found I'm more happy when I'm by myself"
#mgtow brothers
"Yeh, they avoid women."
"I did the math on this a few days ago, based on stats avail at Family Law firms dealing in divorce. The pool of actual decent, non-litigeous women, who won’t divorce you and make you a single-dad---about 10-15%. I only seriously date conservative women with traditional values. Liberal and professional women are avoided wholesale. You’re independent? Congrats. You’ve successfully taught me that you’re adept at going it alone. Have a. good life. I can’t tell you how many women I’ve been hit up on Match who are in their 40s who thought they wanted the kid and career. The result, a kid raised by daycare, and a selfish narcissistic women with no concept of making a real relationship works past the point of when things move out of the honeymoon phase and simply become “life”. An entire generation, maybe two, has been ruined because of Feminism. These women will openly mock stay-at-home mothers and home-makers."
I love my freedom . No need women 👎. Thanks Metoo you liberated us .
Why do they keep showing white guys with black women? CBS loves that.
Just got back from the future...... where women of the future absolutely HATE todays women for RUINING it!
"Instead of ""CBS"" you should just call yourself ""BS."""
I refuse to work with a woman. I'm happily married with no need to have interaction. Don't create the opportunity for a false allegation.
Companies should maybe stop hiring woman to safe their male employees from this problem
Getting you name dragged through the mud because you have a bad date is not changing your behavior is saving your life.
Marriage today is a trap for a man! Men don’t do it!! I’m never getting married again!
"Embrace mgtow , avoid women and live a long happy life"
"'m an employer of my (and another person's) company, and we both specifically avoid hiring women for numerous reasons, one of them being the false accusations of sexual harassments.  Yes, we accept applications from women due to legal reasons, but we haven't hired even one female employee in the 11 years the company ran.  It's just not worth it, unless the female applicant has some really impressive resume (they don't, since high level women don't apply to small companies like mine)."
"Wahmen want your Attention, Time and Money. Yes they see you as an ATM"
All these percentages and polls ignore one key point.  How many men change their behavior by not dating women at all?  I didn't see that item addressed in discussion
MGTOW IS THE WAY
"It is a shame that this story did not talk about men who have chosen to be single. In stories on dating, they always seem to leave this statistic out of the conversation and if they do talk about it, they put men down in all negative ways who choose this way of life. And what's also amazing is the lady spoke about Millennials, but never once spoke about the madness that is really going on like them being responsible for the ""hook-up culture"" because of dating apps and the madness that ensues as a result of them. Thank God I am a Gen-Xer and didn't have to go through any of this. And I am also single by choice and I love every single minute of it."
Now people know why men are going their own way
"You can either love women or you can understand them, but not both."
#MeToo has indeed affected how single men behave: By going #MGTOW
"'Riding into history'. Yep that pretty much sums it up. They rode everything they could get their hands on, and now getting a commitment is history."
"ONLY A F'N FEMINIST:  ""They're more reserved. They are being more careful. Making sure their jokes are appropriate and have the right kinds of conversation.""  WTF, Lady!  We sound like our guard is up and we are dancing for approval.  She said this and never thought that's not a solution. What it sounds like...the backstory of how men became wary and resentful of women."
No women are worth it to waste so much time and resources to them..!!
YES IT HAS! THEY ARE NOW GOING MGTOW!!
"Well, it also STOPPED thousands of conversations between men and women."
she has no clue about dating and the biological clock of women and statistics on the longer they go the less likely they will marry and have children.   She also forgot about domestic courts and men are thinking the juice isnt worth the squeeze.  liability risk is to great.
"As a rule usually guys have made the first move when approaching, but these days if you so much as look in the direction of a woman who doesn't find you appealing then you are accused of creeping or being a pervert.
You only have to look at Joey Swolls channel to see the number of videos where guys are doing nothing at all getting posted and tagged as creeps.
So of course going forward guys as a way of self preservation are not approaching it's absolutely logical this is happening."
"So basically men change their behavior out of necessity because of women, women most affected."
"The fact that we're even polling ourselves about courtship shows that there is no rudimentary trust between the sexes, because ettiquette and sensibilty don't exist anymore."
You dont have to change behaviour with women. Just totally ignore them. Its safer
"Women, enjoy living with your cats
#mgtow"
"Given in today’s cultural mindset of genders multiplied, I’ve dealt with narcissistic drama sky high and massive confusion for a lifetime. No thanks. I’m MGTOW…"
"Mostly women run for money not for men, rich guys with 6 foot handsome attract her, but responsible and nice men who can feed a family don't importance. Run for money, girl will run for you, have a self respect"
"they are being more ""reserved""?? Ahh no they have actually stopped asking women out on dates. hence the recent ""where have all the good men gone epidemic"""
"Millennials - practical

Also Millennials - drum up $70,000 in debt for a low demand job that pays $35,000 a year.

Does not compute"
So 80% of women are asking for numbers from 10% of men. Hypergamy is still alive! The rest of the 90% don’t want to ask women out anymore anyway. Too mu effort. Too much risk. H
"Wow, anhand der Kommentare merkt man schon wie sehr wichtig dieses Thema ist und wie sehr unreflektiert unsere Gesellschaft ist."
"Ich als Mann würde gerne darauf hinweisen, dass nicht alle Männer keine Frauenrechte wollen..🤔
ich befürworte die Gleichberechtigung aller Menschen, immer und überall...🤷🏻‍♂️"
Man braucht nur die Kommentare hier zu lesen beängstigend.
Junge frauen tanzen zu suggestiven Bewegungen auf tiktok. Frauen finden only fans für sich. Das hat der Feminismus sehr sehr gut hinbekommen. Hut ab.
"04:03 ""... beschreibt eine Realität, der die meisten Frauen ausgesetzt sind..."" 

""1 von 3 Frauen erfährt in ihrem Leben häusliche Gewalt""

Daraus folgt: 1/3 = die meisten"
"Ein sehr heißes Thema und definitiv wichtig anzusprechen.
Im Alltag begegnen einem genügend Beispiele, die auf eine ungerechte Behandlung hinweisen, die oft übersehen oder als selbstverständlich gesehen werden. Es ist sehr gut auf einer sachlichen Ebene darüber zu diskutieren, was in dem Beitrag deutlich gemacht wurde.
Vermutlich stammen die verbitterten Kommentare von Leuten, die mit einer aggressiven Form von Feminismus, wie er in modernen Medien weiterverbreitet ist, zu tun. Eine große Vielzahl ist für Gleichberechtigung, doch genau diese werden häufig in den Topf mit frauenfeindlichen Ansichten geworfen.
Sehr traurig, trotzdem ist der Trend positiv."
Bechdel-Test hab ich heute als ich mir den film angesehen habe zum ersten mal gehört und geht mir seit heute morgen nicht mehr aus dem kopf. Gratuliere Arte 😄
"Ich bin so froh, dass ich schwul bin und mit Frauen nichts zu tun habe."
"Erschreckend die Entwicklung. Dabei geht es nicht nur gegen Frauen, sondern auch gegen viele Minderheiten.
Hier in Deutschland hat die religiöse Rechte aus den USA und ihre Positionen seit Corona leider immer größeren Einfluss. Auch die AFD vertritt deren Positionen und die hat in  den Umfragen zur Bundestagswahl 21 Prozent.
Ich kann nur sagen gruselig"
"Sehr coole Doku, danke!"
"Habt ihr Quellen für die Zahlen die ihr dort nennt? Oder einen Kontext? Man unterscheidet bei der Gender-Pay-Gap doch zwischen ""bereinigt"" und ""unbereinigt"" (m.M.: komische Wortwahl), zumindest nach dem Statistischen Bundesamt. Hier werden wieder Fakten verzerrt und von daher kann ich den Rest schon nicht mehr ernst nehmen."
"Leider wird ARTE immer einseitiger. Von Multiperspektivität oder gar kritischem und vernunftgeleiteten Journalismus, ist in Dokus wie dieser nicht kehr viel übrig. Hochgradig emotionalisiert, wenig bis gar nicht in kontext gesetzt und fast nur noch Meinung statt Fakten. Diese spalteriache Meinungsmache führt unweigerlich zu grosen problemen."
"Zeichen der Anziehung als sexuelle Belästigung zu bezeichnen, macht flirten unmöglich. Nach einem Korb weiter zu machen, halte ich für Belästigung. Leider ist es dafür schon zu spät, um nicht in einer Schublade zu landen also flirtet man kaum noch."
0:36 wie einfach der Koran hier falschherum gelesen wird 😂
Das thema ist so wichtig und es nur untertitelt. ich habe eine lese rechtschreibschwäche und finde es schade.
"Ist es sexuelle Belästigung wenn sich die Frauen die Jogahposen bis in die Ritze rein stoßen und dann so herum laufen, oder der gilt das als normal?"
"Für solch ein Komplexes und vielschichtiges Thema sind leider 26min zu wenig. Man könnte über den Gender Paygap in einem Land wahrscheinlich bereits die 26min gut füllen können. Auf jeden Fall sollte man beim Gender Paygap erwähnen, dass es einen bereinigten und einen unbereinigten gibt, weil beide sehr unterschiedliche Werte ergeben. Für Deutschland wären das z.B. nach Daten des Statistischen Bundesamtes zum Gender Pay Gap 2020:
- unbereinigt: 18%
- bereinigten: 6%
Und eine Diskussion starten wie man es genau erreichen möchte, den Gap zu schliessen.
IMHO: Auf diese Weise müsste man jedes der angesprochenen Themen in dem Beitrag angehen."
ich schaue das beim Kochen und ich kann kein Französisch...! bitte übersetzt doch!!!
"Es ist leider soweit gekommen, dass alle Männer (meine Wenigkeit eingeschlossen) auf der Arbeit grundsätzlich schweigen, sobald eine Frau den Fahrstuhl betritt. Kein Hallo oder wie geht’s, gar nichts. Besonders wenn Mann alleine ist im Fahrstuhl. Mann will sich keinem falschen Vorwurf aussetzen, hört sich übertriebenen an, aber so ist es leider."
Doppelmoral
"Wieder mal so eine richtig sexistische, diskriminierende Doku."
Was wären wir ohne unsere überversorgten Feministen und Feministinnen ! (Seufz)
"Ach ja. Noch mein Lieblingssatz. 
""Mütter erzieht, und verzieht nicht, eure Söhne. Sie sind nicht ""Mamas kleiner Liebling"", nicht schon ab Kindesalter "" Mann im Haus"". übrigens grauenvoll für die Seele eines kleinen Jungen. Und nicht ""Partnerersatz"". Frauen haben es auch in der Hand, zu welchen Männern ihre Söhne werden. Das könnte das Problem eventuell wenigstens zu Teil helfen zu lösen. Selfreflektion."
Aber Hauptsache es wird fleißig gegendert!
Ich als Frau kann das nicht bestätigten
Ich kann nicht in Worte fassen wie sehr ich ARTE hasse. Ein Haufen arroganter Besseerwisser. Seid froh dass ihr “zwangsfinanziert” werdet.
Idiocracy….🥸
Feminismus ist auch nur Spaltung
Wenn alle einfach gendern würden gäbe es quasi keine Ungleichheit auf der Welt😂
Wozu me too? Wegen scheidentrockenheit?
Bitte beim nächsten Mal synchronisieren.
"Ich muss zugeben ich mag den Feminismus nicht mehr. Ich will zwar das Frauen gleiche Rechte haben, aber auch nicht mehr als das. Ich fände es sogar noch gerecht wenn Frauen eine Prämie für eine vollendete Geburt bekommen würden aber ansonsten finde ich dass Frauen zu viel Aufmerksamkeit bekommen."
Wieso gibt es bei so wichtigen Themen keine Syncro?
"Eine Gesellschaft kann einem auch den Mund verbieten da diese ihre Faselei und Bluberei als alleinige Formgebung der Materie versteht, was an sich gegen jede Gleichstellung ist da andere auch den ganzen Tag Buchstabenrätsel machen wo jedes mal andere Wort heraus kommen, welche genau so gut in den Pot passen wie all das momentane Gefasel auch.  Und wenn dann bestimmt Kreaturen aus den regierenden Kreisen noch einen vom Jobs erzählen, müssten im Grunde alle Alarmglocken läuten da wir diesen selbstverständlich im großen Buchstabenrätsel "" Werfs in Töpfchen"" für andere die Jobs erledigen könnten. Siehe den Begriff JAGUAUARS die neuen Jumper von Planeten Pumper."
"Wertes Arte Team, unter meinem Post von vor einem Tag sind Antworten verschwunden und ich würde nach Möglichkeit geren wissen ob ihr das wart. danke im Vorraus..."
😂😂 ich kann nur noch lachen.
Auf dem Spiel steht der sogenannte Hausverstand.
"Schon klar, die Freiheit…
Nein Danke Arte!"

Das ist doch alles gelogen und ideologisch. Mann und Frau sind unterschiedlich. Andrew Tate lehrt uns die Realität anzuerkennen.

"Le seul comportement à avoir face à une victime, c'est de lui dire : je t'écoute et on va enquêter rapidement"

Elle a fait plusieurs centaines de plateau télé pour vendre son livre, y a pire comme enfer."
"Il faut qu'elle arrete de se poser en victime , elle qui differencie les morts d'enfants😢"
"Fourest : ""je suis journaliste""

Affirme des choses non sourcées et généralise abusivement des cas exceptionnels comme s'ils méritaient un livre médiatique grand publique.

On a déjà des discussions publiques dans les milieux militants et connexes pour discuter de ça et chercher des solutions et s'imaginer que des jeunes militantes et militants seraient pas armés pour éviter de tomber dans les abus c'est mal les connaitre.
Tout comme s'imaginer que si on est plus expérimentés on tombe forcément moins dans les excès ou les biais.

Alerter sur les abus c'est bien si c'est dans la nuance et traiter de façon proportionnelle à la réalité du problème mais pourquoi en faire un livre qui sert la soupe au publique réactionnaire ? Jamais ça ne touchera le publique qui pourrait bénéficier de l'alerte qu'on prétend lancer et au contraire ça donne des prétextes et des armes aux antiféministes pour lutter contre le féminisme qu'ils n'accepteront jamais.

On peut percevoir des réaction comme étant extrémistes ou dogmatiques alors qu'on est dans divers biais qui nous font voir des choses bien différentes de la réalité. Surtout quand on prend de l'âge et qu'on se met a déconsidérer les jeunes parce qu'ils seraient excessifs alors qu'ils n'ont rien de différent des précédente générations et que c'est plutôt l'observateur ou l'observatrice qui n'a pas sut évoluée et progresser avec la société.

La position de Fourest semble tellement déconnectée de la réalité, semble plus dans un raisonnement abstrait que basé sur des réalité mesurées et confrontées a l'esprit critique pour éviter divers biais dont un des pires est le biais de modération.

Bon il serait un peu naïf de croire que Fourest n'a pas l'intelligence et la maitrise sociale pour constater que son travail médiatique pose problème d'un point de vue féministe. J'ai du mal a croire que éthiquement elle ne sacrifie pas (ou a déjà sacrifié) certains idéaux pour les bénéfices matériels et d'influence."
"Personne ne semble oser critiquer un grand coupable dans toute cette histoire : l’institution judiciaire. A force de ne pas condamner, à force de nier les victimes et d’aider les coupables, la population en vient à vouloir se faire justice elle-même, avec ses propres moyens : les réseaux sociaux. Cela concerne éminemment l’affaire d’Outreau, dont le déroulé et le rôle terrible de m Dupont Morretti alimentent considérablement la défiance des gens vis à vis de l’institution."
"Caroline Fourest parle en son nom,n'a pas la légitimité de juger le bien-fondé des plaintes,des procédures et des actions du mouvement Metoo. 
Il y a une nécessité absolue à :
- accueillir écouter proteger et soutenir les victimes 
- s'opposer à la culture du viol et à toutes les violences systèmiques
- développer des reseaux d'investigations judiciaires, actions de formation et de prevention, accompagnements médico-scolaires et sociaux"
Comment apporter un quelconque  crédit à Caroline  Fourest qui dit à qui veut l'entendre qu'une mort palestinienne ne vaut pas une mort israélienne .....
"Que dit Caroline Fourest du fait qu'une écrasante majorité des plaintes soit classée sans suite, ""faute de preuves""?"
"Fourest monte en epingle quelques cas exceptionnels marginaux, comme si c'etait le probleme principal. C'est malhonnete"
Caroline Fourest c'est l'exemple type de l'effet Dunning-Kruger. Une personne incompétente qui tend à surestimer son niveau de compétence !
je peux lui trouver 3 exemples de proches  femmes qui ont commit diverses formes de mensonges a ce sujet  si elle cherche des témoignages de fausses accusations
"Parmi les ""victimes"" de dénonciation nommées par C. Fourest, il y a un producteur de cinéma, A. Terzian, qui a versé plus de 200000 € à C. Fourest pour un projet de film, qui -heureusement - ne s'est pas fait. Hasard ?"
Lol.elle c'était fait bannir sur France 2 dans l'émission de Ruquier pour mensonges repetes...bref elle n'a pas changé
On connaît Fourest il n'y a pas de commentaire à faire
"Caroline Fourest n'a aucun autre but à chaque fois que de faire le buzz pour aller faire le tour des plateaux. Elle est prête à tout pour ça, méprisable."
comparer une main aux fesses au viol de mazan c'est quand même pas très respectueux pour cette pauvre femme qui en a été victime - il n'y a plus de nuance .
Fourest : 🤮🤮🤮🤮
"4:52: ""Dans 99% des cas ce Je t'écoute doit être un Je te crois"", Ok Caroline donc l'intérêt de faire une livre sur les 1% c'est quoi exactement? On rappelle les chiffres officiels : 1% des cas de viol/ agression son traités. Le reste ça tombe en non lieu ou la plainte n'est pas déposée (pour tout un tas de raison que MeToo a mis en éclairage). C'est ça la Réalité aujourd'hui."
"Fourest représente la définition l'opportunisme. Elle sait très bien que certaines personnes sont fatiguées d'entendre la succession  des plaintes d'agressions sexuelles (qui résulte de la libération de la parole) et se sentiront rassurées à travers son ouvrage. 
Je lui repose de faire dans deux ans un ouvrage intitulé ""Comment le mouvement me too a été étouffé ""."
"""Les femmes ne mentent pas plus que quiconque"". Merci en tant qu'avocate d'avoir apporté cette précision..."
"Les conséquences de son livre vont être dramatiques. Les femmes ont tellement galéré à se faire entendre, et elle, elle débarque de nulle part pour dire des conneries, alors qu'elle se prétend journaliste ! Tu ne te prétends pas de droite, mais tu vas être très étonnée d'être appréciée de ce côté d'un coup. Le même discours que Thaïs Escuffion"
pour moi on est coupable quand on a été juger coupable  par la justice !!!!! la vindicte populaire non merci !!!!!
"Caroline Fourest est une meilleure avocate que Anne Bouillon qui ""ne croit pas"" la sincerite de Caroline Fourest qui pose de vraies questions si notre societe ne veut pas se transformer en tribunal sur les reeaux qui, comme nous le savons,  est un receptacle qui peut mettre en danger ses adeptes."
"Bravo Caroline fourest, et courage, de te battre contre la bêtise de masse. Quand l'avocate dit qu'il faut croire sur parole les femmes qui se disent victimes de viol, sans enquête sans jugement ca ne choque personne ?
Elle affirme qu'elle ne""connait aucune femme qui accuserai à tort pour salir une réputation..."" Merci de ton témoignage mais on s'en fou. Et donc on ne peut pas imaginer qu'une femme cupide sans honneur sans foi ni loi accuse un homme pour le plumer ? Ca ne peut pas exister?
Mais quelle faiblesse d'esprit. Il faudrait vraiment que les études supérieures, basent leur sélection plus sur de l'intelligence plutôt que sur la mémoire, ce n'est pas possible de voir de tels avocats, il faut arrêter de donner du pouvoir à des gens avec aussi peu de jugeote."
"Une main aux fesses vaut 5 ans de prison alors que des centaines de milliers de dealers de cocaïne se promènent dans les rues tranquillement, relaxés ou laissés en liberté! Cette avocate est une honte."
"Il y a clairement très peu de victimes qui sont mal intentionnées. En revanche, il y a des personnes, peu importe leur genre, qui ont des problèmes psys qui peuvent les entrainer à imaginer, exagérer, mélanger. Il y a des phénomènes de foules où les gens portent des jugements sur des personnes dont ils viennent d'apprendre l'existence. Il faut donc s'interdire de négliger la parole des victimes, comme ça a été trop souvent fait, parce que ça nous arrangerait. La parole des victimes est à écouter et à prendre au sérieux. Mais à l'heure des fake news, on ne croit pas aveuglément, non."
"Tu vois, l'affaire M'bappé est un bel exemple de ce que Fourest raconte. C'est devenu un peu facile, le viol est devenu une arme par des gens mal intentionnés, et cela dessert ceux qui sont vraiment victimes de viols."
"Fourest qui trouvent normal que les bombardements israéliens provoquent des dégâts collatéraux, trouve inconcevable que certaines accusations sont le fait de femmes malades et tout à fait minoritaires. Et du coup ce petit nombre qui doit être condamné justifie de discréditer tout le mouvement féministe et Meetoo en particulier."
Honteux la manière dont Catherine Fourest se victimise
"Si un homme, ou une femme, venait voir cette avocate en lui expliquant qu'on l'accuse à tort de harcèlement, j'aimerais connaître son sentiment."
Oui faut condamné sévèrement les pointeurs mais c'est pas simple quand c'est parole contre parole sans aucune autre preuve et c'est pas au médias de jouer au procureur comme madame rousseau qui dénonce bayou a c a vous sans plainte n'y rien sa rappelle staline ou les délateurs pendant la seconde guerre mondiale
"je ne suis ni pour l'une ni pour l'autre mais pour les victimes et toutes les victimes des deux cotés.
Ne pas vouloir admettre et concevoir que certain(s) certaine(s) puisse(nt) instrumentaliser une accusation en faux. C'est la même chose que généraliser et dire que tout les hommes sont des violeurs. 
La lois ne prévoirait pas le délit de diffamations et de faux témoignages si tout le monde disaient la vérités"
"La duplicité de Fourest consiste à ce que d'un côté,dans des débats comme ceux-ci, on entend quelque chose d'étayé.

D'un autre côté en revanche, son livre fournit aux pourfendeurs réactionnaires de Metoo un argumentaire pour etayer leurs propres idées. Et c'est celà que diffuse un tel livre dans la société.

Et cela, elle ne met pas d'énergie à venir le corriger, au contraire."
"Une main !!?? Pas une agression ,voyons.... plutôt un compliment ! Les affreuses ne risquent rien ! C'est tellement évident. 😂🎉🎉"
"Je suis une jeune femme (24 ans), j'ai une amie qui a été agressée sexuellement par un homme, en voyant toutes les procès de viol qui se tiennent depuis le mouvement Metoo, cela me fait perdre espoir en les hommes quelques fois (je ne vous le cache pas), mais je reste convaicu qu'il peut y avoir certaines dérives du mouvement. Il faut vraiment être stupide pour le nier. Je suis certaine que la plupart des personnes en commentaires n'ont pas lu le livre, perso je suis en train de le lire et je peux vous dire que Caroline Fourest est une féministe qui défend les droits des femmes et les aide dans leur démarche à porter plainte.
Je suis sûr que la plupart des personnes en commentaire n'en ont pas fait autant pour la cause des femmes. Même petite, Caroline Fourest a écouté et aidé une de ses amies quand celle-ci a été agressée sexuellement par son père.
Mettre en doute sa loyauté envers cette cause est pour moi intolérable.
Vous devriez lire le bouquin avant de commenter..."
"Elle a raison, Madame Fourest. Peut-on prendre une seule de ses paroles pour dire qu'elle a tort ?
Par leurs excès parfois psychotiques, les ""Me Too"" sont du caca qui détruisent les rapports entre les êtres humains."
"Tellement d’accord avec Caroline Fourest : on est rendu dans une société qui juge avant le tribunal, qui jette en pâture des personnes avant que le jugement ne soit rendu, qui se sont retrouvés harcelés alors qu’ils étaient innocents.
Vraiment soulagé de la prise de conscience du phénomène metoo, que les victimes d’agressions sexuelles soient désormais écoutées dans les commissariats.
Le problème ce sont les prises d'opinions publiques sur l’émotionnel pour faire le buzz, les jugements hâtifs avant même le début de la moindre enquête ou que l’accusé n’ait pu donner sa propre version des faits.
Bref oui au féminisme, non au féminisme extrémiste fermé au moindre débat."
"Juste ta gueule Caroline, je crois que c'est la bonne expression, et faire de l'argent avec, je trouve ça pitoyable !"
Elle veut faire du buzz et de l’argent … l’inviter sur tous les plateaux participent à diffuser une parole nauséabonde qu’est la sienne dans tous les sujets qu’elle traite…
"Pour quelques uns accusés à tort, contre 94% de plaintes pour viol classées sans suite, je sais où est mon camp."
"Pourquoi tant de violence envers Caroline Fourest, c'est un point de vue intéressant qu'il faut avoir l'honnêteté d'écouter et essayer de comprendre avant de le démolir"
"Madame Caroline Fourest, vous êtes très courageuse, merci de prendre le parti de la nuance et de ce qui vous semble juste. C'est justement en denonçant les dérives du mouvement que vous renforcez son intégrité, sa crédibilité, son importance. Merci ❤"
"Beaucoup de sottises,  peu de rigueur intellectuelle,  un opportunisme éhonté  ,  pas mal de mensonges et d'approximations ,mais quand va - t - on cesser d'offrir des temps de plateau à  Caroline Fourest dès qu' elle nous fait un petit caca  nerveux afin qu'elle en fasse son beurre ?"
"Non. Non et non. Les présumées victimes, je refuse de les croire sur leur simple parole. 
J'ai le devoir de les écouter, voire de les aider à prouver, etc. 
Mais les croire a priori non.
Elles sont présumées victimes jusqu'au jugement coupable d'un présumé innocent. 
Si on sort de ça, on sort de l'état de droit."
Les commentaires négatifs face au simple appel à la nuance en dise long sur la société actuelle.
Elle zoom sur moins d'1% des cas et probablement moins pour en faire un bouquin. C'est très inquiétant. Elle fait son business sur des cas de niche.
"Entièrement d’accord avec Caroline Fourest!
C’est beau de voir une femme faire une « not all men » 😂
Sa réflexion a du fond. L’instrumentalisation parfois intégriste du mouvement « me too » pose question."
Caroline Fourest 😊👍
J'admire cette journaliste qui essai d'être objective.
Pour qu'il y ait abus de pouvoir il faudrait que le pouvoir soit de notre côté.
"Comment a t’elle pu oser dire cette phrase à Caroline Fourest ? Pour une avocate, on ne peut pas penser que ça lui à échapper comme ça oups pardon hein…"
"Je comprends tout à fait le malaise ressenti par Madame Fourest pour le vivre moi-même sur les forums de discussion. Dès que vous essayez de prendre un peu de recul par rapport à un sujet quelconque et d'y apporter de la nuance, dès que vous refusez de prime abord de hurler avec les loups en somme, on vous soupçonne de faire partie de l'autre camp. Vous vous faites accuser comme si réfléchir constituait un délit. Il semble difficile pour beaucoup de sortir de la vision simpliste et rassurante du camp du Bien contre le camp du Mal..."
Une avocate écoute avec inquiétude un discours qui rappelle à la prudence devant les accusations ! La justice est entre de bonnes mains.
"« Ce Que j’écoute doit être un je te crois à 99%» , oui donc ça vaut vachement le coup d’écrire un livre pour ces 1%… ah pardon t’as l’hypothèque de ta maison à racheter sur le dos des femmes qui se font agresser."
Pourquoi elle écrit un livre sur ce sujet ? On s'en fout. Ça fait avancer quelle cause ? Aucune. Caroline Fourest est hors sol.
"Je trouve les commentaires sur Caroline Fourest passablement delirants et donc inquietants...croyez vous vraiment que cela mette en danger le mouvement ""me too"" et pensez vous reellement que "" me too"" ne puisse pas etre interrogé ? Pourquoi ?"
Oui mais c était pas 1 pouce😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂EDF
Caroline Fourest est brillante et je salue son courage face aux contresens permanents de ce qu’elle dénonce. C’est une vérité de dire qu’il y a des hiérarchies dans les abus que subissent les femmes. Mettre de la nuance et de la précision apporte au contraire de la force au mouvement meetwo qui est le mouvement sociétal le plus important depuis…ouh…. Il n’y a jamais eu un mouvement de société aussi important. Je pense que les deux femmes sont d’accord mais l’avocate est partie bille en tête en faisant un faux procès à la grande féministe qu’est C. Fourest. C’est dommage.
"Caroline Fourest ne fait que nous prévenir et nous alerter sur les retour de bâton potentiel, comme elle l'a toujours fait . Et honnêtement je préfère que sa vienne d'une féministe que d'une personne qui est contre ce mouvement . Le point essentiel ce n'est pas de ne pas croire les victimes mais de réfléchir, pour les journaliste, à la médiatisation d'une affaire qui au font n'en n'est pas une, et ainsi les 1% vont décrédibiliser les 99% restant .
La preuve en est que nous pouvons avoir des débat entre Humaniste, et qu'il n'y a, pour le moment, pas de débat contre ce mouvement mais juste contre ces dérives potentiel"
"Bravo Madame Fourest, toujours dans la nuance et démasquant les revers de toute démggie."
Mais c'est vraiment si compliqué de comprendre ce que dit Caroline Fourest ?
Et ben tout ça parce qu'elle veut mettre un peu de nuances...ça en dit long sur la société actuelle...
"Les néo-féministes ne comprennent pas que le combat de Fourest est au contraire hyper utile pour le mouvement meetoo, car les anti meetoo se serviront toujours du moindre écart et de la moindre instrumentalisation du mouvement."
"Caroline Fourest a raison de questionner le mouvement ""me too"", ses possibles dérives et sa récupération à des fins parfois politiques/électoralistes. Quand on sacralise un sujet, il n'est plus permis de le questionner et c'est alors la fin de la démocratie. Merci à elle pour, une fois de plus, son courage et son audace."
"Ouaiiiisss, elle est contente Fourest, elle a réussi son business, et les médias qui l'ont tous reçus l'y ont bien aidée."
Madame l'avocate ce n'est pas parce que ca ne fait pas partie de votre quotidien que ca n'est pas une realite.
Caroline est nuancée et réaliste. L'avocate fait son beurre sur les outrance langagière. J espère que ses consultations sont gratuites et qu elle ne vide pas les poches des victimes pour plaider?
"Cette avocate est bornée. 
La démarche de Caroline Fourest est rationnelle et responsable."
"Il faudrait que cette avocate se renseigne davantage sur les fausses accusations (en justice ou par la voix médiatique) en France et ailleurs, il y en a un bon nombre disponible en quelques clics."
Je pense cette Caroline manque de talent et que ce une fabrication de Medias .mais cette avocate en face est encore plus Singler et givré.
"8:00 ""Les femmes ne mentent pas "" effrayant. Une illuminée."
Il y a  de vraies victimes et il y aussi un vertige Meeto Mytho.
"Elle raconte n'importe quoi sur Outreau, les victimes, encore aujourd'hui maintiennent leurs accusations"
"Il est inutile de discuter avec elle.Un peu comme avec les Cons.Incapable de changer d'avis,de remise en question,de méa Culpa."
Catherine Fourest contrairement au vin...vieillit mal !
Très courageuse Fourest de chercher la nuance sur un sujet aussi casse gueule !
"""les femmes ne mentent pas plus que quiconque"" ...et donc mentent autant que les hommes. Tout est dit ! Bravo Caroline Fourest d'avoir le courage de porter un discours de réflexion et de nuance, face au militantisme politique partisan, dont notre société a besoin ! 👌"
"J'ai pas tout suivi, mais être une ""avocate puissante"", ça me gêne... Un avocat n'est pas sensé être puissant !!"
Le feminisme a geométrie variable...
caroline fourest qui dénonce la pseudo victimisation des minorités et qui se victimise sans cesse
"Bravo Caroline, enfin un peu de raison"
"""Les femmes ne mentent pas"" ?? Ce serait pas un mensonge ça madame ? 😂"
Quel courage Caroline face a cette meute wokiste! Tout est dans la nuance.
mytho pas metoo la fourest
"Merci Madame Caroline Fourest pour vos propos et écrits , équilibrés ."
Bravo et merci à maître Bouillon
Catherine Fourest aurait pu se dispenser de cet ouvrage.
"Les réacs parlent toujours de présomption d'innocence (ce qui, dans le cas de viols, signifie ""présomption de mensonge"" de la part de la victime, soit dit en passant). Le souci de la justice, c'est ""surtout ne pas prendre le risque de condamner un innocent"". C'est très louable, personne ne songerait à critiquer cela. Mais on ne parle jamais du risque de ne pas condamner un coupable. Et donc, de condamner la victime à voir son agresseur impuni, et son statut de victime non reconnu. Jusqu'à la fin de ses jours."
"on dirait que tous ces gens n ont pas entendu parler de l affaire d outreau, et de ces vies gachées,car la parole des enfants etaient sacrée et le doute ne devait pas exister"
"Le rôle de l'avocat ce n'est de faire émerger la vérité. L'origine du terme est celui qui porte la voix.

Croire et douter c'est la seule posture intellectuelle qui permet de tendre vers la vérité."
Tout mon soutien à Mme Fourest. J'apprécie beaucoup son positionnement éclairé.
"Nombre des accusation à tort ? exemple de femme qui s'est enrichi  pour de fausse accusations ? 
cette femme a écrit ce bouquin pour vouloir se faire des copains agresseurs et leur donné des excuses à leur violence"
"Mais du coup, il sert à quoi son livre ?"
"Si des gens n'ont pas compris ce qu'elle a voulu dire , c'est que c'est mal exprimé voire mal écrit."
"Le ""Je te crois"" est une parole prononcée dans le domaine de la foi, du religieux. C'est la soumission à une parole divine qui ne peut souffrir, au risque d'être excommunié, d'une remise en cause, un questionnement, un débat contradictoire.  La formule est inappropriée dans une affaire où les féministes réclament justice. Puisque pour rendre la justice, il faut qu'il y ait un débat contradictoire qui amène la preuve mais aussi qui conteste les faits.  Et s'il est tellement difficile d'aborder la justice avec des affaires d'agressions sexuelles, toutes les parties, en ce y compris les avocats, doivent se questionner sur le rôle systémique qu'ils tiennent dans cette institution."
"Quel courage Mme Fourest ! Cette avocate exaspérée qui n'a rien de la tempérance des grandes intellectuelles est un bel exemple de ce que cette nouvelle page de l'histoire de la pensée féministe est : une dérive sécuritaire et identitaire. Metoo a fait basculer le féminisme dans les pensées politiques de droite, voire de droite dure, en se concentrant sur des thématiques sécuritaires. Metoo est à gerber"
"Le ""printemps républicain ""..."
Une main aux fesses ; on appelait ça un hommage ! .. Quel bordel aujourd'hui
L'avocate a fini de me convaincre d'aller acheter le livre de Caroline Fourest
"les femmes çà ne peut pas mentir, forest est un exemple meme devant des millions de telespectateurs face a caron elle n a pas mentit non ?????????????????"
I can't tell the difference between satire and reality anymore.
A man breathed within a 20 meter radius of me without my consent #Metoo
"How to End Up Bitter and Alone, the Musical"
"This is what ""The Wall"" looks like"
This is a disservice to the actual victims of #MeToo
This is the definition of straw man arguments. Creating a target for your ideological rants that is not based on truth in any way. That should be one of the deadly journalistic sins.
She's going to be single for the rest of her life
How many cats do you have to own before this is your life?
A ukelele? Appropriating Hawaiian culture... I'm offended.
Those crazy eyes.....yikes
"I'm glad she sung that song, now I know who NOT to date."
"Ugh.  ""Comedy"" has gotten so bad.  Making your actual talking points while making goofy faces and being condescending isnt what parody is.  Stop this."
"Keep up with the good work sponsoring and publishing horrible content guys, you're on the right track to self-destruction. Thank you very much"
"Dear New York Times,
Stop hating men."
"Man: ""Can I say anything right?""

Woman: *Pushes him away in disgust*

That pretty much sums up the horrible woman's problems in a nice, clean nutshell."
I couldn't stop laughing until I realized it isn't satire or poor sarcasm.
"Lmao shes got them crazy eyes. This video is trying to portray men as ""toxic"" but it's having the opposite effect."
Women used to be dignified and respected.
So tired of the demonization of men.
"This is the first time I've seen a comment page be so much better than the video itself. I'm tired today's adults (I'm a part of this generation born in the 80s) who get triggered easily, think it's ok to demonize ALL men over the sins of a minority of men, etc. etc."
"If this song is aimed at portraying the tenuous, wailing hysterics of the modern feminist woman; then congratulations, you've created a masterpiece. I just don't know whether to vote up or down."
"The things the men supposedly said wrong:
Guy 1 - didn’t want to talk about politics on the first date (A pretty normal thing to do). Saying that a movement possibly has gone too far despite its good intentions (a reasonable stance). Asking a girl he likes to come and watch/support something he enjoys and participates in (a very normal thing to do).
Guy 2 - tries to see a positive side to a dark outlook on life that she brought up (a healthy thing to do). Apologizes when she takes it the wrong way (a good and polite thing to do). Indicates that some men do bad things but trying to find a way to get her to trust despite that (a normal thing to do).
Guy 3 - feels uncomfortable with her dark assumption of him (very normal for a first encounter). Tries to sympathize with her and make her feel more comfortable (a very normal and good thing to do). Expresses frustration when she intentionally misconstrues his sentiment on multiple occasions (very very very very normal thing to do).

You are the problem, not whatever you think they mean."
"So sad that this generation has sunken and reduced the dating culture to some form of predatory behavior men commit. 😞 sad future for women, because many men will be afraid to approach you now for fear of being accused of sexual harassment or saying the wrong thing!"
Her cats liked this video
"""journalism"""
All I want is a woman who's sane.  I guess we're both going to be disappointed.
Exhibit A for why Men will take robot women over real women.
What cancer is this
"What a brilliant parody of modern women. Maybe a bit too far, but still pretty clever."
How bad can reality be that I can't tell if this video is satire or not
"She’s joking about it and trying to generate humour but she does actually feel that way . She’s not a regular woman making fun of feminists , she’s a feminist trying to generate humour."
"""This movement got a bit out of hand"" - said the Jew in 1938.
""well change happens after taking a sand"" - Said Adolf.

Just sain'

but still feels like a satire.

Edit, yeah it's satire."
Good one. But you brought it on yourself. :)
So let me get this straight. Pun intended. Is there nothing that this woman won't find offensive? Is this a parody or satire of liberal lunacy?
Produced by Moshe Shekelstein
Has the NYT been redpilled? Pointing out how ridiculous/hysterical some of these movements have become? Impressive.
I'd like a woman that hasn't had twelve men in her.
this hurts the New York Times brand. clearly journalism can't be neutral anymore. why do you need a bias? I am a liberal and I can't take the clear pandering/bias on this. unsubscribed.
Why is the #me too movement ignoring the #120db movement ?
Not satire.
So what you're saying then is 8 years of Trump
Toasty Roasty

"'satire' the original"" i was just trolling LOL"""
"Poe's law, baby. Satire or not, you know full well this stuff happens alot."
You know... I became a Times subscriber because I like to think that my money is going towards a bastion of rational thought and a champion of truth in the world.  Seeing this video... I regret being a Times subscriber.
I feel like I've committed my first crime… I listened to this song.
"Collectivists, stop telling men to read the room, we don't need total hivemind consensus to make decisions about what we think"
Women like  this make me glad I'm homosexual.
Why are people with tiny stringed instruments so awfully annoying
"Over 27? Too old, do not want."
"I was really struggling with the intent behind this video. Is she a poe, is she serious, is she mocking men, is she mocking femenists? But No i just watched her standup and other videos. She’s not self aware or smart enough to be doing this on purpose. I truly believe  this is just a moment where the art really supersedes the artist. As if her hand in writing this was unknowingly guided by the most holy and lead to create pure cosmic tragicomedy. And like all of Gods creations, it fractals up and down infinitely so that there is always another layer of comedy encasing the last and always another layer of tragedy encased within the next."
"You keep singing this song
Its been going on and on
Is 30 years not enough?
You march the streets all tough
But then you cry and you whine
Call out ""He's a Weinstein!""
And once you've ruined his life
You go back to your strife.
When you're not screeching in the nude
Your crying for his money, dude

I can't think of an end to this song, because you won't end yours."
"The most disturbing part of this, to me, is that the NYT thinks this counts as an ""opinion.""

What was the opinion?  What was she even saying?  Who knows!  Who cares!
The New York Times, ladies and gentlemen, ""We used to be respectable."""
*doesn't actually smash the tiny guitar on the mic stand* You had one job.
"This is a glorious critique on the venomous double standard and obsessive disdain at the heart of modern feminism and SJW culture in general.  Bravo, and well done."

"literally this lady has sanpaku eyes, you can't make this up. Crazzzzzyyyyyyy"
Can The New York Times smell its own death?
This is why genuine news companies shouldn’t delve into satire. It just comes out as stupid and cringey.
"This is how people who have never had normal social interactions think normal social interactions go.
It's like watching Lifetime."
"Toxic, Problematic, Yikes, etc"
"I appreciate the satirical aspects put forward in the video, however it isn't much of a joke when it is a horrible reality."
Please let this be a joke. Just please
This is why feminist comedians only make 79 cents on the dollar.
I genuinely can't tell who this should be insulting towards.
Y'all finally posted this on youtube! Now every other commentator can roast it!
It's not satire if you actually believe it.
"This is a satire, i refuse to believe otherwise."
2/10 Wouldn't bang
Wow!  I don't think I've ever cringed so hard.
"She really gonna point fingers and call others tone-deaf?
Gotta give props to whoever wrote this though, thinking up such clever rhymes as ""Hey hey ho ho, Donald Trump's gotta go""."
#AssumeTheVictimIsLying
"I fully believe the reason I've spent my entire college career locked up in my apartment online with my friends is because:
1. I'm more introvert than extrovert
2. I'm convinced that college culture/most women will dislike me for my non-con-formative views.

I was told for my entire life that college was suppose to be a great time in my life, and there have been good times, but its mostly been me cringing at how brainwashed society has become in believing the narrative.

Its sad too. There are a lot of great guys out there that are good people, but society and the media have convinced half the population that they are evil. Most of these guys are super normal and coming from humble backgrounds. But I'm white and male so I guess playing video games, hunting, reading, writing D&D stories and grabbing a drink with my friends makes me ""privileged"" or a bad person.
Despite my parents working from paycheck to paycheck for everything we have. A voice in the back of my head tells me to wait until everyone else grows up and I'm well established in life before dating. But I'm young and I want to find someone special in my life. We want the same thing, but I'm not accusing you of crimes you haven't committed."
Great to see women like you pushing MGTOW forward your truly doing the lords work. Well bye and thanks for all the fish.
This is either the perfect spoof or tragic beyond words
"I can understand why her cat growled. That song was terrible. They should name this song ""I'm going to be single forver""."
Is this satire? I want to get off mr bones’s wild ride
If this was supposed to be comical why do I have depression
Feels like this video will have a rough time given Poe's Law.
I feel like this is satire making fun of radical feminists gone too far. I can't really see it as anything except that.
"""I'm Single this year for the very first time.""
Me: Don't act like it's your first time."
The like to dislike ratio gives me hope for humanity <3
"Hey not all women are bad...

But thats not ok to say about a guy."
I am proud of this community.
I absolutley salute this parody. It's an accurate example of feminist overreacting and acusing men of things they dont even have proof upon. Their movement became a parody just like this video is showing it and i think we need more videos like this to show just how ludacris it became.
Omg...I thought this was just some crazy individual...it's the bloody new york times! rofl
How delusional can someone get?
I can't imagine why you have problems finding a good man.
"Call me a definitional purist all you want but this doesn’t fit the definition of satire. 

Satire is “the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues”. The only way this is satire is if she is criticizing herself for her beliefs which she clearly isn’t since she is presenting one perspective: her outlook on the world. She believes wholeheartedly in what she says and believes she sneak this by as “satire” by adding a ukulele... not so fast!"
Keep laughing ladies...
I honestly can't tell - is this satire?
MGTOW!MGTOW!MGTOW! This is exactly why I am MGTOW
"This is not satire, this is a crime against comedy."
Women have been doing an awfully good job lately at undermining female supremacy in this world. Keep up the good work!
My faith in humanity as portrayed by the massive dislike ratio has been restored.
"Hmm, it's almost like there's some reason men are running directly away from c**ts like this."
"Nice hate piece ...
Previously we could have maybe thought this was satire. Can't even claim a POE here though, cuz if it was, it would be an implicit critique of female behaviour in current climate, and we all know that would be sacrilege."
Tara Reade.
"Remember the Gaby Petito story? Maybe if people weren't so quick to dismiss domestic violence or so quick to side with the boyfriend, she'd still be alive."
"Was Tara reade
A me too girl?
🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️"
Metoo was just another way for these people to cry over themselves. Nothing new. We dealt with this whiney behavior our entire lives. Our kids will suffer through it as well
All this is moot now as our latest Supreme Court justice can't give a definition of a woman!
"Now, if we could only get the Gaetz's and Kavanaugh's out of the government."
Remember when democrats cared about people?  Neither do I
Thank you governor Youngkin and DeSantis for banning CRT from public schools and the book Maus
Thank you for starting the conversation we will continue it together
"Zerlina, what an amazing woman! I look up to you and thank you for all you do!"
"Violence Against Women? What is a woman,anyway?"
Tamika Mallory lost all credibility when she defended hanging out with Farrakhan. She either needs to step down as an activist or renounce him completely.
"Me Too
What a bunch of B.S!!!"
Native black Americans pushing the line for reparations but MSNBC got the black woman pushing the line for me too!
"MeToo thoroughly discredited itself 2 years ago when their ""Believe all women"" went straight out the window with their utter silence and lack of support for Tara Reade"
Me too.. Of False accusation
I don't think that one on the right will have any issues with or without any new laws.
Bill Clinton and Harvey Weinstein.. couldn’t be reached for comment..
The problem with this movement is the definition of a woman….what is a woman
"1  I""m glad she included gun control.   2. How to behave?  Be Gentleman!"
# justice for Johnny Depp
Where’s the me too. When biological men are dominating women’s sports.
President Trump will PREVAIL!
Me too. Keeping sexism alive and well.
What is a woman?
Some men need to grow up and stop being players of women.
double the sentence of false accusers
"Absolutely agree with him.
If a woman makes false accusations, She should immediately be sentenced the same amount of jail time the man would get if convicted"
Took him years and tens of millions.
And thats the real problem. The fact that women rarely(if ever) are punished for false accusations against a man.
It's funny how heard claim Johnny beat her but the next day there was no bruising or swelling. Other ladies that were beat up had body and face swelling and bruises everywhere. No makeup can really cover it up. Heard had flawless makeup
"My husband went through this. Unfortunately, we don't have Johnny Depp money, so he had to take a deal rather than get the not guilty verdict"
Living with someone who poops in your bed is demonic. 😂
"*when SHE is cryin, SHE is lyin!*"
It's sickening to accuse someone of rape and abuse
I 100% agree with myron here protect your seed yall avoid this as much as possible its not worth it the risks outways the benefits it happened to 2pac as well
“ Shitting on beds and stuff “ 😂😂😂
That's true . Tha happened too to such a celebrity. Just imagine regular men.
"Sadly due to corrupted women abusing their privileges.  A lot of innocent men are in jail. Even if they prove their innocence, their lives are still forever destroyed."
I have a rule.  If a woman accuses a man of something i listen but don't believe.  If the guy is rich or dated the girl and moved on I immediately side with the guy.
"She's evil, not crazy."
Shitting on beds and stuff 😂
Shit the bed and tried to blame it on the dog
She should’ve been in prison for life
"This dude is 100% right I absolutely agree with him women that do this type of shit they need to be held accountable and I’m a woman saying that, so what does it say about me?"
Shout to all my exes for never shitting on my bed🤙
Don't forget this also had butterfly effects. Completely destroyed the Fantadtic Beast franchise.
Mandatory DNA test for every birth in the US
If it can be proved in the same court that the accuser lied they should get similar punishment that the original defendant would have been facing
I agree 1000%!  Yes protect women if there found guilty. But if caught lying or slandering? Whatever time that man would have got. The false accuser should do.
"I think you’re all being too harsh on her, don’t forget her dog stepped on a bee! 😂"
Jail all false accusers.
He brought up the herd turd right out the gate😂😂😂
"I got accused of grape with a girl I didn’t even get to 2nd base with, some of my friends believe her, lost them, I live in a semi small town so my name was hurt too. The girl lied, nothing came of it cause the grape kit safe me but my name was never cleared. Now I don’t trust. I was this close to going to prison. 💔"
Never fails women's like always...smh just too proof he was guilty smh
"Take note men. Record EVERYTHING. You never know when you will have to use it in the court of law. Every time you feel ""Man, that's not right."" Record it. And don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. These women out here don't care about you bro. And they will destroy you financially out of spite and then rinse and repeat with the next guy."
"Next time you watch pirates of the Caribbean, remember the entire series was ended by one dump"
"Yeah I’m a victim of false accusations it’s sickening, what that woman put me and the rest of my family through"
"In the middle of actively trying to destroy Johnny Depp's life because she is petty, Amber Heard got a modeling contract."
"I thought he recorded in his own home? 
Not illegal"
I watched the entire trial (or at least part of it that was allowed on camera) that crap was crazy
"A woman can write your name on a birth certificate and in most states, even if the baby is not yours, you have to pay or they will go to jail."
I thought falsified police report was a crime in of itself!
But the feminists won’t talk about it🤦🏿‍♂️
"Yes indeed, glad someone has spoken on this. Why is it that the person that cries wolf doesn't get in trouble when they lie. I had the same thing happen after it was investigated they found out she was lying and nothing was done after. I didn't go through the same thing with court and everything but I had to speak to the detectives a few times and then come in a third time to get the information about what happened."
Its not illegal to record conversations as long as one party knows.
"We really need to penalize
Women who are physical emotional verbal mental 
Abusers for not only
Monetary benefit or gain but for everything else that they're abusive for & wanting
To Control & they Lie!!

"I agree, we need to punish those who get proven to have lied about their accusations. Not a matter of “believe all women”, it’s a matter of ensure no lying."
false accusation should hold the same charge as the accusation
"At the very least, a false accuser should receive the same sentence the accused would have gotten."
"She was penalized, she lost the court and was ordered to pay $15 Mil"
"Yall see the video of amber on the stand railing a line of blow? 🤣 it’s apparent she lied about everything, ended up needing the grace of the Yayo just to last"
He ain't lying there
"I am a woman, I was graped when I was 12 and for me it is abhorrent to cry wolf about something so serious... real victims or survivors are often not beleived because of theese dispicable frauds 😮😮😮"
Don't forget he already got found guilty and one court of Law and had to go through the whole thing again
Bro looks stressed out. The life he lives has caught up to him. Was it worth it? Nothing he did changed anything. 304s are 304s and simps are simps.
She should be in jail
He didn't lose the purses of the  carribean he turned the role
Most of us don’t have the money or resources to prove our innocence
🦆 the british courts that sentenced him guilty
"I have audio of a woman literally hurting me, three days after 4 level neck fusion. Laid up in a bed... couldn't even go downstairs. Police arrested me, saying, I instigated it by, and I quote... ""Not doing as she asked and going to wash the car."" Literally, three days after being released from 4 level, neck fusion with cadaver bone.

State of Idaho. CDA. Judge Peterson. Convicted me, I spent my 30 days after fusion, in a cell. Neck fusion. Needed help to even wash my body, wasn't able to shower for a month. Didn't get to see my real doctor's. KMC medical center even said I didnt have surgery... the fired the doctor who did the surgery, she now works in WA state."
So Johnny Depp is the Spokesperson for what Black men have gone through for decades.
The process is the punishment
I just got done with a 3 year battle because of that.
Send these woman who make false accusations to El Salvador for the rest of their life.
"100. She needed punished. She perpetuated evil.
😢
She went free"
This is why I don’t want to be in a relationship
This is so important!
That was crazy work.... shout out to Johnny d
And she never lost her role in Aquaman 2
Johnny deep was definitely innocent smh
100% true. Men need legal protective n from women's false accusations.
"Yup.  Some. People just want money

We've created a monster
"even teenage girls (rarely, i admit) do this too. can't remember the details, but there was this young black man who got his future and scholarships taken from him because she falsely accused him... and she didn't even feel bad about it."
That last part needs to be true
You can use most divorce and custody cases to prove your point.
"False accusations can destroy marriages, careers and lives. Not only that but also i believe it's very disrespectful towards real victims who previously or currently have to deal with real domestic abuse. It diminish the struggle."
Any average normal regular guy who went through with Johnny Depp went through with Amber Heard would have had their life destroyed because they don't have his resources.

"To add on, the public, even the women, believed Depp because he's a movie star. If it's another average guy, none of those broads will care, and will still think he's the abuser. Women decides if you're right or wrong based on things like your money, status and how they FEEL about you. They don't ever make rational decisions"
When men finally wake up and realize that woman are mo longer these innocent frebble soft humsns.  The world will be better off
We went from not listening to women....to believing everything...human nature over compensaing
we can't punish people for falsely accusing women of being witches cause then they won't come forward for the real witches
"I genuinely believe that if a woman lies about sa and its proven that she lied, she should serve the time the guy would've served if he was proven guilty.. anything beneath that punishment is insane."
Key correcton... the recordings were not illegal... they were prescribed by their couples therapist as part of their counseling.
And there are still females who believe Johnny is guilty of Amber's  allegations.
"Thanks ladies, you told men to not ever believe you or take any of you serious. Us men risk jail for even taking any of you seriously. And i never heard of one woman that ever called this out. To this day. Hence why ill never never trust women. Thanks ladies, you ruined it for the the rest of them. Ladies, start at calling the rest of them out and denouncing them atleast"
Don’t know any women to be raped but I know multiple guys who were falsely accused and luckily had receipts as well
#MeLieToo
"Yup, the W always get a free ticket!!! Geez!"
If a person cry wolf. Life in prison.
"Why don't we ever hear about defamation lawsuits against women who try to ruin men?  You mess with me like that, i'm getting a judgement of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS! can't pay? Get out there on the streets and do what you do. always room for one more on Bissonnett. 😂"
"To deter this type of crime— give three times the penalty for false accusations/ allegations!!

Rape of woman = 10 years prison.
False rape allegations = 30 years.

I GUARANTEE you the false accusations would go way down."
The courts should just have you in a neutral ground until they find out what was true and or false before stamping the person as guilty or innocent.
"There are consequences for your actions, and women should not be immune"
Her dog stepped on a bee. To hall with Depp
don't forget about the harry potter spinoff movies he was a part of but got taken out of because of it.
Mgtow saves lives
Straight facts
Call this guy whatever but he aint lying.
"Here is the issue. Most of the time when there is an imbalance there is an over correction. It is true that prior to the metoo movement too often women were dismissed too often. However, believe all women is a good idea that was misused. 

To make it work it should've been believe all women COULD be telling the truth so all accusations should be investigated BUT it should always be anonymously investigated. So the accuser and accused should get the same anonymity. Only when there is a verdict of guilty can the anonymity be broken. Anyone who opposes this literally opposes innocent till proven guilty."
Been in that situation
Exactly
All claims from women on things like that  should not be believed but they should be investigated and if its found that she or he made false claims with malicious intent minium 10 years in prision and fines equaling the cost of the investigation would stop false claims in a day
So true...
It is known that a Rule From God for all of us is that we women must not go in a room alone with a man who is not our husband or our real father or our real son or our real brother or our blood uncle.  Are children taught this in public school in America?
release video of women sexual assault in mass in delhi pogrom/genocide
"Trust me married women and young girls and boys are being violently attacked by their own family members.  Ladies: please take care and “When in Doubt, Check Him Out”.  Pray for safety and peace at home! Always.  I have remained unmarried because I was attacked at work at the age of 16 by a creepy sexual predator boss and also in my 20’s both at home by my drunk F boyfriend in college and at work.  

I don’t care how much money they have.  Since that, I’ve turned them all down for marriage.  I won’t tolerate drugs or alcohol in my home. Period.  End of story.  Again, ladies, protect yourselves and your children from monster’s like these. ✌️🙏💜"
"Obey God's order and be safe, even after death also."
Harvey may be wrong but at the first place you guys must opposed instead you accept the offer and after becoming famous you speak up. It seems you are using him until you become famous.
Now let’s talk about women’s dress code. Does it say “f*ck me 2” or “respect me 2”?
"KARENS !!! ASEBLE !
avanger theme song 🎵🎵🎵"
Free Kurdish people
I think it's pretty ironic that they photo-shopped the pop star who's most popular song went against the idea that you have to be skinny.
"why would they do that without Megan's permission, that's rude"
"Her natural body is banging, the photoshopped version looked unnatural."
"she literally has such an average body size for people outside of hollywood its crazy that shes the standard for a ""plus sized"" celebrity"
"**Photoshop’s video**
Danielle Cohn wants to know your location"
"""instead  of  all about that bass,it's all about  that WAIST!!""😂😂😂😂"
"""So instead of all about that bass its now all about that waist"" hahahahaha im done"
ive always wondered how they even photoshop videos like??
"Bro, her body shape is already gorgeous. She is one of the prettiest singers that I know."
"""Made curvy figures cool again"" excuse me when did being curvy go out of style 😒"
"The real Meagan looks beautiful.  Why  the hell would they photoshop the original version,  there was absolutely nothing wrong with it.  Hollywood must remember that real women have curves!!"
Was this whole video just made for that horrible pun?
I really don't see a difference in her waist when comparing them. Just a little bit
"""Made curvy bodies cool again""
They never stopped being cool or attractive."
"Her weight isn't even problematic when we talk about health. This is the editors purely shaming her real looks, and it's so sad to see that people could just think that it's okay."
it’s so weird that she’s considered plus size in our society. like … she looks like a normal human
It’s not “All about that base” it’s “All about that waist” 😂
I’m back here years later to say this woman wasn’t “fat” I remember back in middle school when this came out thinking she was plus size now I’m seeing this again and she isn’t it’s crazy how the media does people
"2016: no
2017: no
2018: no
2019: let’s recommend this to everyone"
"They photoshopped her without even considering the fact that the photoshopping looked unrealistic in itself. She is beautiful the way she is, and no one had the right to do that to her as if she had an issue."
"I hate when people say it was ""photoshopped"" it would probably take like a year to get it to look smooth if you were to photoshop each frame assuming its 60fps xd"
Wether she did it herself and then fixed it or a publicity stunt. It sent a good message to kids.
Who wants to change Meghan's beautiful waist!? I was awfully disgusted when they changed her waist
"“When its all about that bass now it’s all about that waist”
Nice lisa"
She’s beautiful just like she is.  There was no need to crop her waist.
"I don't see a difference 
how the heck do people see this stuff it all flies past my mind"
Okay I've never understood Meghan or whatever her name is.. She's literally average size for someone her age.🙄🙄
I call it video shopped is it just me?
6 years later and  I still believe that this was a publicity stunt and she was aware of everything. U have no idea how far people would go for fame.
I commend her for sticking to her ideals and not letting this fly under the radar. Her normal waist already looks fine
shape doesn't matter be proud at yourself and be confident
Curvy was always cool...
"“Instead of all about that base it’s now all about that waist”


Okay okay..


I see what you did there."
Seems youtube wants me to watch this now..
Took “workin that photoshop” to a whole new level
I cringed when she said all about that weist
"XDDDD ""And now shes all about that Waist"" HAAHAHAHAHAH IM WEAK YO"
"Narrator- ""so instead of all about that bass...""
Me- ""it's all about that waist...?""
Narrator- "" it's all about that waist""
Me-"" nailed it!!!"""
yeah only reason she is saying that is cause everyone pointed it out
I HIGHLY doubt an edited version was released without her seeing it....seems like damage control because they were called out.
Good on her
OMG I THOUGHT THE REAL ONE WAS THE PHOTOSHOPPED ONE ;O; MEGAN TRULY HAS A BEAUTIFUL WAIST
Its hilarious that this is what hollywood considers a plus sized girl
Looks exactly the same I’m so confused especially when they show “with the photo shop and without” and the image doesn’t even change
Whoever photoshopped her waist is a WEIGHTIST.
I love Megan she loves herself for how she is
"What is it put in quotations? Having someone digitally edit your appearance is insulting. We're exposed to photoshop daily, but that doesn't make it any less offensive or more okay."
I can’t even tell a difference
I barely notice a difference
I love it when news Anchors make extremely monotone puns
"I wanna point out she didn't become ""infuriated"" until the fans called her out"
Not lying mrs Evans is my teacher and mrs.evans was her teacher
"She looks gorgeous either way, dunno why they had to change it!"
"She admitted it until fans noticed it. 
We'll keep believing her ""truth""."
She was never plus sized
She looks way better without Photoshop tbh
"let’s be honest, none of us searched for this"
I love how confident she is!❤️
They legit were trying to give her a BBL.
"I gotta be honest, if they didn't point this out, there's no way in hell I would've noticed"
*WOAH this was 3 years ago!! 2019...*
I like how she so natural and isn't like oh ya that's my waist she imbrassic her natural beauty.
"Yeah let’s edit a perfectly healthy, fit, beautiful woman to look skinnier than she is because there’s just not enough body image issues in the world!!!"
does it annoy anyone else that they keep saying photoshopped when you cant photoshop a video?  😂
I didn’t even notice lol
Mad respect for Meghan on this one.
Wowwwwww that person who spotted the photoshop has good eyes!! Lol 😂😂 like how did they even notice that! 😂
"I'm impressed, I bet no other singer would ever really argue about something like this to be honest. Not gonna call out names."
You can’t even tell the difference
Who ever photo shop Megan is sooo ironic
"On a song that promotes not being slim of all things. I freaken love Megan trainer, she is a wonderful role model and activist."
The irony....the irony....
"“Instead of all about that base,it’s all about that waist”MADE ME CRY IN LAUGHTER😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🥲🥲🥲🥲☺️☺️"
"First, who calls her a pop princess and second all of her music sounds the same."
"I don't see that much difference, she is not overweight"
How was this news worthy
"It wasn't that much of a difference, for them that have done that. I mean it's smaller yes! 
But they didn't need to do that at all. She looked good as heck from the front and back...."
"“It’s all about the base”


us in first grade:ITS ALL ABOUT FIRST GRADE FIRST"
"The difference is so subtle I couldn't even tell, and still someone felt like it necessary to do that. Wow"
Barely noticed any difference
I love Meghan. She gives me so much body positivity. Ilysm Meghan Trainor
I'm not a fan but I love that she makes us curvey girls look normal😚
Meghan trainors waist is just beautiful I like how she handled the situation
i think people should lose weight instead of encouraging it but not shaming fat people either
"It’s really rude to photoshop someone’s body, especially when THAT person is telling people you don’t have to be skinny to be beautiful."
She’s embarrassed because her fans noticed LOL
"No one:
YouTube 3 years later: here, watch this 😍"
Meghan is INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL! Photoshopping her is a crime.
"I don’t think anyone should be bad at Meghan , she doesn’t really have much of a say in how its edited"
It's the marketing strategy. They have planned it from the very beginning.
It wasn’t even that much of a difference! She has an amazing body!
She's one of the only curvy females I support. She looks beautifully healthy. Unlike lizzo promoting obesity.
"*""All about that waist!""😂😌*"
Her body is gorgeous. Why fix something that's not broken?
"Bruh, photoshopping Meghan Trainor? She had an entire song that showed Photoshop was a fish."
It’s now all about that *✨w a i s t✨*
I think people noticed that she photoshopped it and tried to play it cool
"""So instead of all about that bass, it's now all about that *WAIST* "" hahahahah you're so punny."
They photoshopped her to look skinnier in a song about her being thinker ??? Why.
I see almost no difference. Just me?
Tarana Burke articulates the problem so clearly. Good interview.
"In tears, this childs story breaks my heart."
Well said Tarana Burke
Tarana Burke is so good ! An American hero!
"Tarana---I have long held the belief that unless and until MEN CONFRONT OTHER MEN BEHAVING BADLY---this dynamic won't really change.  When they see it, confront the man directly....don't be afraid.  STAND UP FOR WOMEN.  Only then do you deserve to feel righteous."
He’s an accomplice.....this is easy work fire his a$$!
Question: The parents of the girls never questioned why they were getting $300 for visiting some older man?
Absolutely shocking ☹
"I think it's time for Mr. Epstein to meet ""Big Bubba."""
I will never try and convict any man based on an interview. Take me to a court and let the factual evidence decide one way or the other.
"Jennifer it is not your fault that you didn't report him.  You were groomed, manipulated, violated, assaulted. Trauma like that impacts a person on so many complex levels, including overwhelming fear and shame that is like a prison. 
It is not your fault. 
It is not your fault. 
None of this is your fault."
Thank you!
Who was recruiting these young girls for Epstein?
Where were the parents?
Blame The Parents😈
He is still alive
"“‘You were the seal of perfection,
    full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
13 
You were in Eden,
    the garden of God;
every precious stone adorned you:
    carnelian, chrysolite and emerald,
    topaz, onyx and jasper,
    lapis lazuli, turquoise and beryl.[a]
Your settings and mountings[b] were made of gold;
    on the day you were created they were prepared.
14 
You were anointed as a guardian cherub,
    for so I ordained you.
You were on the holy mount of God;
    you walked among the fiery stones.
15 
You were blameless in your ways
    from the day you were created
    till wickedness was found in you.
16 
Through your widespread trade
    you were filled with violence,
    and you sinned.
So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God,
    and I expelled you, guardian cherub,
    from among the fiery stones.
17 
Your heart became proud
    on account of your beauty,
and you corrupted your wisdom
    because of your splendor.
So I threw you to the earth;
    I made a spectacle of you before kings.
18 
By your many sins and dishonest trade
    you have desecrated your sanctuaries.
So I made a fire come out from you,
    and it consumed you,
and I reduced you to ashes on the ground
    in the sight of all who were watching."
First Bill Cosby now him who's next
"If you research the recruiters you’ll see that “FlyGirl” pulled all of her social media except for YouTube. I got a feeling that one of these recruiters made a deal. They probably finally got caught and made a deal to turn evidence.The dominos are gonna fall. Feel so sorry for these young girls who were molested, they need so much love and support. Now is the time for the good guys to step up and protect these children."
And where are  the parents where a 14 year old girl can have enough time to visit someones house without parents looking for her
"LOL, they had Busta Rhymes up there talkin to Velshi."
☹️
Epstien should burn on the courthouse steps. But lets be honest. Aint nobody trying to take that. Aint enough whiskey in kentucky or ireland for anybody to try to push up on that.
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING JOE BIDEN AND BILL CLINTON WOULD DO

These comments make me so happy to see so many waking up to the truth about this gynocentric society we all live in
It's absolutely hilarious at my job. The women will only talk to/ flirt with the higher ups with their suit and ties. These losers start to believe these women actually like them then all of a sudden BAM! He's in trouble LOL
"This woman is right. I can see this movement getting out of hand and extreme feminists hijacking it for their own narrowly defined agendas.
 Already I've seen commentors equating bosses who yell at them with sexual predators. Sexual assault is illegal - a ""mean"" boss is not."
It's too risky now for companies to hire women.
"A drunk chick grabbed my junk at a bar one time , I started flipping on her and she bought me a drink .. but should file charges ?  I mean it's all the same right ?"
Bingo. That is what this is designed to accomplish. They want to drive a wedge between men and women.
In a word...YES!  It's a promotion of MISANDRY...hatred of all men...and it like misogyny should be declared a crime against humanity.
"No, men are not more masculine now. Masculinity is definitely a before thing."
Next thing you know thousands of gynecologists are gonna be charge for sexual assault.
"If a woman accuses someone on social media, she is lying.

If she files a police report, I have a hard time doubting her"
What is my sin against women? Believing that they aren't all like that.
Yes! This is a bullshit movement!              ✌🏻
"Hollywood & Hillary need to admit who knew?  Merle Streep, Metoo. They ALL knew."
I'm so glad you had her on Tucker! Finally a voice of reason in this madness!.....A real woman ladies and gentlemen👏
"Tucker, lots of info been round for 40-50 yrs...how can you look surprised."
"Oh no, not judging all men!! That means us whiteys will be  vilified too and let's just keep that to the melanated population."
"Even though I support MeToo , I do think it's unfair to the accused men, because it's just like a he said she said. There's no proof either way. And some men get wrongly prosecuted too."
the liberal me too movement is a joke
MAGA ???? the answer = MGTOW !!!
"From the buzz of being an independent women a decade ago to now being an independent man. Man, times have changed"
"I am a woman and have sons and feel this Women's movement is overkill.  What a childish slogan anyway, it reminds me of little girls in school who tattle on boys.   It is causing men to actually be afraid to approach a woman or talk to a woman.   That is a sad development and men should definitely have a me too movement."
"I never thought I would ever agree with Tucker Carlson, but this Women's movement has gone too far.  Men are being accused of domestic violence, thrown in jail and considered guilty until proven innocent.  Case woman who visited child's Father's home was told to leave, she sat on the floor (hardwood) in protest.  He picked her up and she left.  Twenty four hours later she filed DMV charge and he was arrested.  She said he slammed her to the floor.  SHE HAD NO MARKS OR INJURIES and this was in the police report.  Some women are using this tactic to get full custody of a child."
Men go fishing. They cast out an un-baited lure repeatedly just to see if anything bites. Women go fishing. They cast out un-founded accusations just to see if anything bites. For both the men and ladies it costs nothing.
MGTOW schools are needed.
She admitted that not all men are rapists? This is damage control. Holy crap
"i took the red pill....employers will simply shut the door and not hire any woman due to the huge financial risk of a  sexual harassment charge, you might say they will sue you for discrimination charge, but they will simply pay that small fine, which will save their company, the bosses job, life etc... i am making popcorn and going to watch this ride."
"With all this shit going on, maybe shirara law might not be a bad thing"
Nope the past 50 yrs has.
"If you want to think about the me too movement. Think of Clarence Thomas and what he went through. One of his former employees Anita Hill accused him of sexual harassment. When he was about to be confirmed as judge of the Supreme Court, the allegations against him were intense. And he the more Anita Hill said that he did sexually harassed her, he kept on saying. “I did no such thing.”"
...casting stones!
Based mom :D nice get Tucker
"""Survivors March"", I love it. As a survivor of slow internet, I know their pain."
"This is what i used to say ........... but people nowadays are getting blind in equal opportunity sort of rubbish movement. If someone is culprit, contest ur case in court . Do not run media justice in front of whole world . to me its wrong"
Women aren't saints: we all have family!
One of the few rational females.
"Most people are rational and logical and there will be some questionable accusations, but being Fox News, and with your history, you should be at the forefront of this movement, unless you haven't 'cleaned house' yet, which might explain your paranoia and complete dismissiveness of the whole thing. Sending out your 'forced to wear skirts and dresses' women is helping either side of the debate."
"MEN!  If you find a woman like this,.......PUT A RING ON IT.....ASAP!"
"Blacks are TIRED of the MeToo Movement. I've been tired!! I hope they just go away... ...""FOREVER!"""
No one can be put into a box all races are different all people are different men are different and women are different there's bad and good in every human being on the Earth!
"Anyone else get a kick out of the ""pound me too"" slogan?"
Me too movement is toxic I don.t support it also I.m not feminist neither
"Me/too, is garbage, as it moves unilaterally; that is women get a TOTAL free pass................that is BS !"
#dueprosses file your police report so i can expose you and sue.
valentines ruined this year ? YEP
MGTOW 4 fucking life
"If you were ever sexually harassed and worked with 27 men who allowed it to happen for years and years until one day one single man decided to speak up! I think if the horribly demeaning advances, totally inappropriate touching, insinuendos made to you in regards to how to get a pay increase, men trying to force themselves on you, trying to speak out to upper management and getting laughed at, and so so much more. I guarantee these two idiots would feel would feel and understand why the victim feels the term ""all men"" not just the few so-called criminals become scary to a woman or vice versa. You learn to put up a guard and not trust any man. I know that there are good men out there, but typically there are a lot of men who will never speak up and allow it to happen. I'm trying to raise my boys to have more respect for females.  Some victims have it a lot worse than some of the allegations being heard.  My story wouldn't make public tv because it would be rated X.  It really can be quite horrible - trust me Every day I wish that I could put it out of my mind and move on from it. But it's just so damn hard to be forgiving, forget and moreso trusting. Haven't you had a boss or co-worker who irritated the crap out of you in so many ways? I doubt you ever forget someone along your career path 4 reasons that aren't even harmful in nature. Now magnify that times 100 plus YOU lose your job due to that's so called retaliation. You have to cover everything up for years and before you know it it's affecting your marital life as well as even raising children. That anger builds and builds to the point that we lose trust in the opposite gender fully. I apologize that I sometimes include all men but that's more of a figurative way of speaking. Very hard to understand until you've been through it yourself."
YES
so sad i cant hung  a woman no more when am rich
"I love Christina Hoff Sommers. 
Smartest real feminist around."
mgtow
"Nope, just the sexual predators."
"it's not an ""all men"" judgement, it's a ""those men"" uproar.  What we are seeing is an explosive women's movement against a workplace problem that has been going on for decades.  Women didn't speak up.  They didn't know how to.  They were scared to.  They were embarrassed to.  They believed it was ""just me""."
"Women are only a single large EMP event from being forced back into 1800's roles.  You cannot change intrinsic biology and the differences between the sexes.  As you move more women into the traditional male-dominated work environment, you will see natural male tendencies to procreate and have sex with as many women as possible (not al men will be able to control those urges and not all will be able to do so indefinitely in all situations).  When you change the gender roles based on feminist ideology---and mix the sexes like never before, you will have reality.  Previously, society had roles and expectations which resulted in more segregation of sexes that prevented a lot of this.  Those roles have been removed.  Perhaps women should raise children and maintain homes as that is the roles that are most suited for (not mandatory or for everyone, but the feminist notions are artificial and hurt children and society---including women). You cannot legislate away the differences in biology."
Next thing you know thousands of gynecologists are gonna be charge for sexual assault.

The ‘Lee Millers’ of the world have always existed. The milieu has changed and that’s what’s happening. Let’s not be tainted by movements and let it happen naturally by recognizing it for what valor. Would love to see more stories like Jane Addams come to the silver scene.
Men it would seem (by our nature perhaps) simply are unaware of their partner in a way that women are aware of the other person in the relationship. We are real to each other in different ways but equally respected
I’m sorry but he’s right. A lot of men are now wary of being involved with women in the workplace especially.
"He is absolutely right. 
I have friends with businesses that think the same way.
Why? Because women have become a financial liability for companies..."
he told the truth and sometimes people don't wanna hear the truth
"Robbins was right, despite the apology. I'll always make sure never to be alone with a woman in an office anymore, now that I know I can have my life wrecked 20 years after on a simple allegation."
People actually blew Tony Robbin's comments/actions out of proportion - the highlights of the incident do him no justice.  He pushed the lady in the video as an example to demonstrate a point not because he was trying to enforce his will.  His comments come from a good place.
"Probably the most positive person in th USA and they pull this shit on him. He explained himself very well in the video. Victimhood is not the answer. The shame is yours. You have dig deep to see the issues and bring yourself to overcome them but they are yours. Identifying the abuser is only a very small first step in healing. And money won't help you heal caliber - it will likely make it worse. Heal-up, get on the horse, and ride again!"
My problem with the #metoo movement is that it is sexist in nature. Both women and men can be sexually abusive.
He is not wrong though
If you don't try to understand what's he is saying you run the risk of missing the whole scary picture
I mean as a woman it wasn't cool what he said but it's the truth😐
A movement that can not take light criticism is moving in the wrong direction.
His right you know
It's terrible how some people can say something wrong by mistake and get so hated for it. Can't even talk anymore. What in the world are we doing to each other?
"If he was a victim, he has the right to an opinion, enough said"
"Here we go again, if you dont agree with these people they attack you. Everyone wants to be a victim. SMH"
"Of course he's sorry and wants to get connected with the women of the Me Too movement. Any other response would cost him profit in his business of motivating others. He's a businessman, plain and simple. His bottom line is the almighty dollar."
He's only saying sorry because people got offended by his remarks but he was saying the truth & the truth hurts.
He’s right
How is that offensive?  Tony Robbins is a genuinely nice person. Everyone is making it so you can't say anything without offending someone. Absolutely ridiculous. He shouldn't have to apologize. He will because he's nice and never intended to hurt anyone.
"I understand Tarana, but he's right.  They are both right."
he is RIGHT
"If a man is uncomfortable hiring an attractive female, he is the one with the problem, not her.  Victim blaming 101"
Tony is just saying the truth
"Never apologize, It'll never be good enough."
He’s right but it doesn’t matter if you say anything that doesn’t support me2 100% that will try to ruin your career
His contribution to our world reaches far beyond what you can see in this short news clip. If you do not know who Tony Robbins is I encourage you to learn more about him before jumping to conclusions.
"He’s. One. Hundred. Percent. On. Point. 

Eff metoo. It’s only hurting women and is just a ploy by women who want their five minutes of fame. Gtfo."
I thought the #metoo was a meme.     :/
'Me too' is malevolent.
Tony Baloney
"Always someone going to mess things up for someone who helps thousands of people! He's just telling the truth! This country can't handle that anymore or? Some of you woman wanted to be treated the same well here you go!!!! How about ""COMMON SENSE MOVEMENT"" or isn't there any left?"
#himtoo stop objectifying him!
good for him
"I heard the same thing, men are now afraid to hire women.  For the first time, since I was a young kid in the 1960's, I am starting to see all male office environments again.  Not a woman in sight.  No problems, no drama, and no lawsuits."
Why not encourage ppl to hire both men and women and encourage employers and employees to keep their hands and nasty comments to themselves and dont make false accusations so that they won't have any problems in the work place!!!! His apology comes after he realized his mouth could cost him money!!!!!!!!!!!🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Listening to his comments I don't think he was against the me-too movement I think he's against those who utilize movements like this to lie cheat and steal which cheapens the movement for those who are actually Overcomers from traumatic events.
I am a woman and I find nothing wrong with empowering women not to label themselves as victims and live life as a victim
Let's bully him for saying the truth....
Robbins should not apologize for telling the truth .no one wants to hire women.why would you gave how week
He was right though. This is like apologising for the crying baby.
Why apologise for being against victim mentality
That's why I don't get hired sometimes. Female bosses are too attracted to me ;)
i stand with him
"Isn't what Tony Robbins is saying yet another way to shut women up?  Shame them for coming forward? Telling them if they continue they will not get job offers from male employers because ""they"" are afraid of women.  This is the same attitude I've heard for the past 50 years.  Tony you are off base."
wtf he's right abc take this L he's right
"He did not say anything wrong to her, she misunderstood him"
"He is absolutely right. 
Me too bullshit mouvement made it very dangerous to hire women with all the false accusations and so on. 
Women brought this upon themselves."
The only reason Tarna (whatever the hell her name was) is because women can't have their lives ruined by false allegations
"I’m not for or against tony.  It seems to me he is saying victimhood will get you nowhere (i agree with that), but then he is also saying if you fight they will just fight back (this is what the demonstration with the lady was meant to prove), so is there no point reporting anything according to Tony?  He also said ‘he without sin cast the first stone’.  Just because you’re not prefect doesn’t mean you don’t stand up for right and wrong and justice. That isn’t the meaning of ‘he without sin’.  It means don’t judge someone’s moral failure, but applies to consenting adults.  The metoo movement was about non-consensual behaviour."
He has nothing to apologize for.
"One time a girl ""accidentally"" touched my finger. I am a survivor 😤💪🏼"
He's still alive?
Tony saved thousands of women from sex trafficking this year alone... did you mention that?
if you have to go find outrage like a heat seeking missile so you can feel better about yourself ... then you got bigger problem than abuse.
"""I'm not knocking the Me Too movement. I'm knocking victimhood"". So you go to a self help seminar then complain when you're challenged for having a victim mindset? Robbins whole program is based on creating your OWN happiness. Personal accountability and I don't mean that in the sense of blaming yourself if you went through a tragic experience, but owning up to your life and the hand that's been dealt to get through that experience. You are responsible for your own happiness."
I FORGIVE HIM🙏❤️💯
dont care love always!!  Tony rocks
"Fu-- his excuses and apologies...he made profoundly unenlightened HARMFUL comments and as a "" non victim"" he will have to take his lumps..SUCK IT UP!!!"
"Cannot say I disagree with what he said if one realizes being a victim isn't healthy whereas being a survivor is empowering.  Tony Robbins is in the empowering business not the pity part victim movement!   

And men as well as women get harassed and assaulted so lets stop making the #MeToo gender specific.  And unlike many people who misspeak at least Tony Robbins apologized!!"
Be more professional sometimes you need to pick and choose your words to get your point across and someone that's been abused he should have been more selective of his words he should know better
#YouToo Tony
Tony was right stop hating on Tony !!!!
I don't like this guy but he was right that Metoo is a culture of victimhood.  What hes said since has been complete bullshit aimed at not losing followers.
#It’soktobewhitetoo
Opinions expressed fail
This is the problem there are so much people getting offended by something so small mostly women that just give them another reason not to hire you. You can't even listen to something without getting people offended. What makes you think you will get a job by complaining and that's why you things will stay the same because that's all women do ( not all ) I have to put that so people don't get offended anyways they complainin and wonder why they are in the same place maybe if you look at what your trying to get equality you should see what we are doing because you are busy worrying about what other people think will guess what that's the difference we don't care what you guys are doing well just get shit done. But it's getting harder not to care because you are dragging all your problems to us like it's our fault.
"It's about our humanity, fellas."
So what was the big deal?
"I am a women and I am not part of the me too movement.  He is so right and women need to get a grip on things.  You are distancing yourself from men and other women.  First of all I would agree that you should be respected by men - that first comes from respecting yourself.  Not the say that all women are responsible for what happens to them....but it you act and dress like a slut you will be treated like one.  Yes, I have friends that have been raped.  And yes there are horrible men that take advantage of women....but come on....some of you need to take a little responsibility.   First I would say to stop idolizing the celebrities that have the demonic symbols in there concerts.  If they are controlled by demons why would you want to be like them?"
"The deciding factor is not whether or not to hire an attractive woman!  You hire the person most qualified and if it's the woman,  make sure your male employees know how wrong sexual harrassment is! Make sure they know the repercussions of making any woman uncomfortable! Make sure the males know that sexual harrassment/assault/misconduct will not be tolerated whatsoever!! What the heck is this childish behavior about it's better to not hire women at all?!  GTFOH thats a damn sorry excuse for not wanting to do the right thing!"
Tony's an aggressive sob..landshark con guy
Tony is no ones fu*king GURU!
Yuk
Good news!!!
Who in their right mind would pay and listen to a person telling them nothing?
True 😢
Tony Robbins is about money and nothing else.
"Life, doesn't end when we die from this physical plane, what happens is our physical eyes eyes close, and our spirit eyes open; now, if during your physical life you believed in God and called upon the name of Jesus, when you leave this physical world your souls will go straight to Jesus, where you will enter into the kingdom of heaven to live forevermore. However, if you didn't believe in God nor call upon the name of Jesus, when those people die their spirit eyes will open into a world of condemnation, and they will be judged and will suffer the finale of spirit death; choose life! Follow no man or guru, swamis not preaching directly from the Holy Bible and following God and Jesus, also read that book yourself."

"This has become a joke
Every other person is accusing a man of harassment without providing absolutely no evidence for the courts to decide
I do sympathise with a victim, if it is genuine
Otherwise this is a method of blatant attention seeking"
"Me too me too, now vinod dua saying me too.😎😎😎😎😎"
"Please report Times now in house editor  who is accused in mee too movement, its surprising how mirror now is comfortably avoid reporting it. Is it because u cannot report an inhouse incident."
WtH?  it should be an accuser's responsibility to produce the evidence to back what he/she claims. Not the vice versa. Allegations doesn't make anyone guilty. #NotGuiltyUntilProven
"This has become fashionable these days to put allegations against anyone.  If it is true, let her file a report with the police rather than blowing up in the media for publicity.  It appears the BJP media machinery is working to tarnish anyone questioning their policies."
Vinod dua Khane ke baad Ye sab 😂😂😂
What a shameless Journalist.  Why he is quite now. He was asking others like Big B to speak up for Tanushree. Now himself is quite on his own case. Bloody Hypocrite.
Misuse of me too movement by this propaganda channel which is the devil's advocate 😈
I support nishta jain.  I hope thewire takes right action immediately.
Saare bjp k khilaf logo pr #metoo laga rahe hai
50 dislikes? someone is unhappy with allegations.
"The wire ne tanushree ko support kiya tha nana ko nahi dekhe hai ab kya karte hai....
Tanushree ne bhi koi proof nahi diya tha."
before putting allegations on anyone have a look at yourself in front of mirror.... Nishta jain...

Shocking with such kind of allegations on mr.dua..."
"Matter should be investigated neutrally ,if proved  true then  ,the propagandist  Modi  hater ,Binod  Dua  should be sent to Tihar."
Mr Dua's real face exposed. Now even Pappu can't dare to give padma bhusan in 2029(if at all).
Vinod Dua ji aaj hi BJP mein Shamil ho jayein aur yeh keh dein k maine jan gan man ki baat mein jo kuchh bhi bola sabh sabh galt hai to Nishtha ji apne aap case wapis leleingi......

Won't believe.

"True face of dua.
Hats off girl."
"What is that he said? He predates how? 

WTF woman!!!!

MeToo is now like he didn't open the door for me 40 years ago and I feel still screwed up.

MeToo is a serious movement in which people who actually have committed the crimes against women in the expletive are named."
"What objectionable thing, can someone elaborate?"
Shame on these shameless....
Vinod dua??? Unbelievable.. men think it's their birthright to pass lewd remarks and grope women...
"Shameless Media person,  VINOD budha abusing Women ! what will happen if some one did same to his daughter ?"

Aaj dukh hua mujhe sach
Ye modi ke support mai bol rahi hai modi ki ex wife ko bhi lao metoo par
"See what his daughter said about pulwama attack,she support pirkistani incident"
"Well he may or may not be guilty. I don't know what the truth is and I don't take anyone on face value. 

The only thing I must admit is he did not deny his allegations gracefully! A supporter of #Metoo calls allegations against him as ""keechad"". 

Well, the wire has an article saying ""Film maker accuses Vinod Dua of sexual harassment"". The Wire is not in agreement with Mr. Dua on this stand."
"Okay, u r documentary film maker and why the hell you went to a journalist for a job interview...

It's seems fake to me.... Please Metoo ka mazak mat banao, kahi iska asar na khatam ho Jaye and real sufferers to insaaf bhi na mil paye 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
whole The wire is sexual harrasser.

One question. What do you want to do about it beside whine?
Loving the 476 to 1 subscriber to view ratio!
"With little notice, President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order that advocates say rolls back hard-fought victories for women in the workplace. Tuesday's ""Equal Pay Day"" — which highlights the wage disparity between men and women — is the perfect time to draw more attention to the president's action, activists say. On March 27, Trump revoked the 2014 Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order then-President Barack Obama put in place to ensure that companies with federal contracts comply with 14 labor and civil rights laws. The Fair Pay order was put in place after a 2010 Government Accountability Office investigation showed that companies with rampant violations were being awarded millions in federal contracts. In an attempt to keep the worst violators from receiving taxpayer dollars, the Fair Pay order included two rules that impacted women workers: paycheck transparency and a ban on forced arbitration clauses for sexual harassment, sexual assault or discrimination claims. Noreen Farrell, director of the anti-sex discrimination law firm Equal Rights Advocates, said Trump went ""on the attack against workers and taxpayers."" ""We have an executive order that essentially forces women to pay to keep companies in business that discrimination against them, with their own tax dollars,"" said Farrell. ""It's an outrage."" Out of the 50 worst wage theft violators that GAO examined between 2005-2009, 60 percent had been awarded federal contracts after being penalized by the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division. Similar violation rates were tracked through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Labor Relations Board. Now isn't that order very consistent with the sexual criminal confessions we all heard not once. but on two separate occasions during the Axis Hollywood bus. previous to that during his interview with Howard Stern. Former prosecutor Gov. FBI director Giuliani. Said those audiotaped criminal confessions were nothing more than locker room talk. Not according to criminal psychologist brain specialist those audiotaped criminal confessions were much more consistent with a jailhouse confession from one inmate to another. Or a prison reminiscence from one convict to another who are living out there sentencing in protective custody, for sexual crimes are classified as the weakest form of criminal conduct. Not to mention any other prosecutor in the country would take two audiotaped criminal confessions as enough evidence to prosecute. And then when you have 14 witnesses come forward and validate everything that was on those audiotaped criminal confessions.Would be enough evidence to convince any judge of a conviction. Well any judge except for that desperate week insecure impulsive poor specimen of a female judge that goes on and on about how great it is being a submissive trumpet blower. And you wonder why America has the highest violent crime rate in the world. You wonder why America has the highest drug addiction alcohol dependency in the world. And you wonder why America has the most overfed undernourished people in existence. is not all gloom and doom. We can deal with this situation. As a people as physically fit mentally sound and spiritually balanced Americans. At the same time we are dealing with the situation in life. Subconsciously spiritually there souls and spirits are being implemented with, all the pain suffering disease sickness illness torment and hunger that has been allowed to occur over the years manifesting into what it is today. Thanks to incompetent lazy ignorant reckless negligent vindictive criminal leaders supporters employees employers. And now going to get far worse if Donald Trump his submissive trumpet blowers desperately impulsive employees have their way. Now let us thank our heavenly father for allowing Ronald Reagan Donald Trump supporters followers employees like-minded people for subconsciously: coherently apparently volunteering their soul and spirit to function similar to an air purifier water filtration system steam cleaner rubber gloves sponge shield bedpan urinal ass wipes blowup doll. But plug tampon maxi pad diaper jump rope ankle weights wrist weights weighted vest punching bag so forth and so on. Etc. etc. and that is the short list of how their souls and spirits are being treated. Before we get into how their souls and spirits are going to be implemented with all the pain suffering disease sickness illness torment and hunger that has occurred over the years manifesting into what it is today. Keep in mind my submissive trumpet blowers the soul and spirit can endour one up to  billions of years worth of pain suffering disease sickness illness torment and hunger .that is just a sample Of the miraculous power of spirituality eternal authority that exist beyond your comprehension for your life cannot commonly comprehend things past your life's expectancy. Now I wish and pray for my soul and spirit to be held spiritually accountable to the statements I proclaim. I guarantee you will never hear another body leader person of legal authority ever validate the statements they proclaim with that level of certainty. If the sun the father the Holy Spirit God the devil Lord Jesus or anyone else with true eternal power and authority over life and death. Felt differently about the statements on proclaiming the had four separate opportunities to keep me dead and silent. The bottom line is you're either part of the problem are part of the solution when it comes to equality between a man and a woman as well as respecting another persons physical freedom. See a dominant gentleman knows how to intelligently persuade passionately convincing a woman to have the desire to willingly want to share themselves romantically. your part of the problem are solution. Either way your being held spiritually accountable. One way comes with a pleasant form of rehabilitation physically mentally spiritually. And the other way is the opposite of the first way. Again I wish and pray for my soul and spirit to be held spiritually accountable to the statements I proclaim. I guarantee you will never hear another body leader person of legal authority ever validate the statements they proclaim with that level of certainty. One reason they don't know themselves therefore they have NO respect for themselves and can't respect others. Secondly is because they are not willing to hold themselves accountable to the way they live their life to the laws the put in place. For the laws they put in place will greatly influence whether you live and die Feeling accomplished being at peace. The bottom line is Donald Trump has been clinically diagnosed by criminal psychologist brain specialist! Leading physicians As being physically and mentally submissive! To fill that massive void a weakness) His plan to stay on the top! Is by keeping the bottom sick week desperate hungry and malnourished and poor by recirculating dirty low-paying jobs that come from outdated power sources inferior materials and toxic substances. That have lived out there usefulness for they have been classified scientifically as petrified death! More commonly known as coal oil and gas dirtiest of all sand oil. Along with other toxic chemicals that never changed their killing composition. You cannot promote life by using a substance that diminishes the quality of our air water food and landscapes. Dirty low-paying jobs very few at that however will have a negative effect on hundreds of millions for only God knows how many generations dirty low-paying jobs that diminish the quality of our air water food and landscapes with the potential of causing environmental collapse there is no profit to be made in the demise of the planet businessman my ass! Just look at the BP oil spill. The man-made water crisis situation in Flint Michigan. The man-made water crisis situation at the military base known as Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The fly ash spill that occurred from Duke Power in North Carolina. Those are a few examples. . . Of the irreversible damage that comes from working with outdated power sources inferior materials toxic substances. That have been scientifically classified spiritually validated as being physically mentally useless therefore have no true value spiritually. Now a dominant gentleman or lady that knows how to demonstrate high-class sophistication which is femininity at its finest!! for it is raw wild naturally hard-core organically appealing truly captivating absolutely eternally spiritually sought after by the gods and goddesses of the ancient royalty, warrior elite...... knows the best way to stay on the top is by keeping the bottom confidently rising in the most efficient way that is humanly possible, allowing each generation to become stronger smarter healthier happier financially better off. For that possibility of a reality to come full circle. The people must have clean high-paying jobs that used new technology. Allowing the people to fully utilize on advanced self sustainable renewable power sources. New Age top notch materials resources, that you could use this much is you would like or need without leaving any excess toxic waste behind.  equally as amazing our products can be) Manufactured  mass-produced in state of the art facility's I am talking about clean high-paying jobs from coast-to-coast globally. That improve the quality of life by enhancing maintaining the quality of our air water food and landscapes! Products Imports exports personally professionally To the highest degree of standards. Clean high-paying jobs that will be available every day of the week every week of the month every month of the year. Throughout their life allowing them to have a retirement that they will be healthy and wealthy enough to enjoy. xox XXL"
"The disgusting insensitive comments just proves their point that people like y’all in the comments couldn’t care less about them and their experience, I swear these comments are sickening"
"If these women wanted a form of support.. they could just make videos with achievements and actions and happy music at how a support could help them, instead of another ""victimized"" video."
"Women in USA and India suffer in silence when it comes to rape due to their male-dominated societies. But occasionally some rapes do make it to the headlines, creating much anger and disbelief. Other than that, it's business as usual, back to more sufferings in silence"
Harvey hmmmm
He is innocent !!!
He called her honey because he's a bee.
"Seinfed is awesome: ""Men and women chase after each other, right? .....RIGHT?!?!""."
She wanted to set him up but Jerry is not a fool.
Jerry is very good at isolating a question and answering it directly and not being suckered into a debate. He’s funny and a good listener and a very talented comedian.  Glad I grew up around his show.
"That second ""RIGHT???"" was a thing of beauty 😂😂😂"
That was a premature honey. Now he's got to go calling everyone honey so it looks like he's just a guy who says honey a lot.
“Right. RIGHT.” Well said Jerry.
He dated a 17 year old when he was in his 40's. He's never seen anything creepy happen.
She is trying so very hard to bait him into saying something he'll regret. He sees the game and calls her on it repeatedly. What's impressive is that he does it in a way that simultaneously indicates that he won't be pushed around but at the same time doesn't come off as defensive or petty. He doesn't rise to her provocation. That's tough to do on your feet.
"I like how she tried to make a deal out of him calling her “honey”, and he was essentially like, “ yeah, we’re not doing that.” She was wise to let it go. 😂"
"""honey"" is equivalent to ""bless your heart"""
jerry dated a high school girl when he was 38 but he's never seen comedians being creeps. look in the mirror honey
"""Men and women chase after each other ,right?.....RIGHT?!""  Jerry's no fool, he sees what shes about"
"Jerry's smarter than I thought. I always thought he was an average comedian, but he was great at not being baited and trapped with the ""right?"""
“Honey” is Jewish for “well bless your heart” 😂😂😂
He’s like “don’t ask me about my 17 year old girlfriend”
"That wasn’t an accident by Seinfeld, he knew exactly what he was doing, that was a professional “fuck you”."
"My God, how much I loved that second ""RIGHT?"". She wasn't going to concede anything, not even that men and women could voluntarily have sex with each other."
"Seinfeld is saying that the ""honey"" thing is an idiom for ""you're being naive"" about this being about the industry, it is everywhere."
I will always remember Jerry Seinfeld for dating an underage teenager when he was more than twice her age.
"I loved the way he leaned in and asked her ""right??"" As if she could deny it somehow...😉😂😅😂😅"
"She was all like, “Who does this guy think he is?!”

And he was all like, “...I’m Keith Hernandez.”"
"00:55  i love how he forces her to admit the obvious instead of just asking the questions and putting all the liability on him.  that's gold, jerry... 'ts gold!!!"
Of course the man who dated a teenager in his 30's doesn't think Weinstein did anything wrong lmfao
"He's 100% right.  This is in every industry,  in every part of life. Its in the film Industry, its in education, its in coaching, its in the financial world, its in the arts, its in health care........its a humanity problem not one specific industry."
She tried to paint him into a corner and Jerry was having none of it. Good for him.
Seinfeld has absolute contempt for nonsense and I love that.
Interviewer a minute in: “Shit...this guy’s way smarter than me.”
"That ""RIGHT!?"" was such a power move."
"Interviewer after: ""Can I get a hug?""
Jerry: ""No thanks..""
Interviewer: ""A little one?""
Jerry: ""..mm. no.."""
Being 38 with a 16yo gf and acting like nothing fishy was going on
"""Honey"" is a very show biz way of saying, ""Get over yourself Lady"""
i love how he turns the interview into the start of a seinfeld episode
"“It’s not the industry, honey”

I like how he slipped a Bee Movie reference in there"
He used to date a minor when he was nearly 40. Enough said.
"""Men and women chase after each other, right?"" 
* blank stare *
""RIGHT???""
Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!"
"“Men and women chase eachother, right?”
[She refuses to answer]
“Right?!”"
"I think, the word "" honey"" was used sarcastically and she deserved the sarcasm."
Don’t try an bait a comedian.  They make a living talking and being quick witted. They will go on the offense. It’s what they do
"""You cannot not be funny.""
""Of course I can! Am I being funny now?""
""A little.""
Even here."
I remember when calling someone honey was a nice thing. It’s not like he was flirting. The lunch lady calls me honey and it’s very sweet
Funny how Louis C.K. overcame the controversy and owns it in his shows now.
The way she tries to make Seinfeld look stupid by creating awkward silence at specific moments in the conversation is absolutely dishonest.
Jerry will never be uncomfortable against anyone ever...
I like that he managed to make her laugh while talking about such a serious thing. Navigating sensitive topics isn’t even what he’s known for but he handled this well.
always funny for the guy who dated a high schooler in his late 30s to try to be the morality police
"""RIGHT?!"" - the best part. He didn't let her get away to try to fabricate her own reality in front of gullible viewers but instead actually making her acknowledge the reality as it is most time when men and woman are together in situations like that - which is is frivolous, before moving on with the topic. Excellent"
"As a woman I can say it’s true, this happens in every club, in work places, in the street, wherever, it’s not the show business, it’s everywhere"
"""It's not even a good story.""
Summed up perfectly with one line."
"I think everyone  agrees that the show, Seinfeld was great.  Jerry, however, from everything I have seen and heard about him seems to be a jackass."
"She's so used to just being able to say ""You just called me 'honey'"" and get the guy to crawl up in a fetal position and say he's sorry, that when he just responds with ""yep"" she has absolutely nothing."
"""What's the deal with HARASSMEENT?!?! Can't you just ask her out"" - Jerry Seinfeld, the method comedian"
I remember Larry David in Curb telling Richard lewis: You just gave a premature honey 😅
"Jerry Seinfeld dated a 17 year old when he himself was 38. So I can't help but feel like he's an unreliable narrator. Also, isn't it true that sexual misconduct is very common in the entertainment industry, when compared to other fields? I could be wrong about that, but it is something I have heard and it seems like the case when you keep hearing about these things."
"“You just called me honey…”
“I’m sorry, it must have been very painful for you darlin”"
"its not the industry, Honey. 

                         -30 yo man who married a 15 yo child"
"Everyone's talking about the ""honey"" interaction but low-key that's the most intelligent thing I've heard about the me too movement. It's not new, it's not confined to the ""industry"", it's about the global difference between the sexes."
"I love Jerry's interviews, he doesn't play the game..."
The casting couch started in the film industry and became synonymous with it. You can say it happens everywhere but that doesnt get the industry off the hook as Jerry thinks.
seinfeld sounds more and more like an older jewish man with every year that passes
"What is difficult in these scenarios is straying the coversation from being hostile, while still conveying your point. Given the context, those were some fantastic social skills."
I like how he dealt with her. Respectful yet didn’t take any of her shit
“Did you see any of it” Guy dated a 17 year old when he was 38. He’s part of the problem 😂
"We all know who set up this question...
NEWMAN!"
"""You gotta get with this, this isnt showbiz ""

Dude wasn't messing!"
Jesus Christ he took control of the the whole conversation with a woman using his aggressive voice and it actually worked!
"After all these years when you realize a certain people from a certain country can do all sort of sexual abuse, even against children and escape to that certain country...
Seinfeld definitely loves and donates to that certain country..."
The man is too smart and secure to fall for lazy interview tricks.
"Seinfeld himself, like the show that bears his name, is brilliant. Even pausing to get the interviewer to acknowledge that yes, through time immemorial, men and women chase each other. He doesn’t give anyone a pass, but places it within the context of his observable reality only. Brilliant."
"Jerry is smart, no B.S., and clearly a step ahead of the interviewer. This is why he's a major force in the business."
Says the guy who dated a 17 yo in his 30’s.
"her: ""you just called me honey""
Seinfeld: ""yeah, were you not here two seconds ago?"""
Bravo for refusing to be defensive or to follow a bs narrative.
"Dude who dated a kid as a 38 year old man and said that she was actually on the old side while confronted about it on TV claims he never saw anything.
Sure."
"Jerry became triggered because he was with a minor when he was almost 40 years old. It is the industry, honey. It is."
"My mom has called every waitress/waiter honey for 40+ years , I never thought for a moment she was saying anything inappropriate AND I STILL DON'T."
Jerry has added so much laughter to my life and he continues to do so everytime he opens his mouth. Love you Jerry.
Seinfeld dated a 17 year old high schooler when he was 38.
"This is the same guy who ""dated"" a 17 year old when he was in his late 30's. He's definitely part of the problem."
Jerry took control of that interview like the pro that he is. How to call someone “honey” and not be apologetic. Never really enjoyed his work but this was 2 mins of must watch. She thought she had him but he squashed that in 2 seconds flat.
Reminder that a 38 year old Jerry Seinfeld dated a 17 year old until she was 21. I’m not gonna take some creep’s opinion on another creep
Jerry Seinfeld dated a 17yo when he was in his 40s. He’s acting defensive bc he’s afraid
"While still a 17-year-old high school student, she met then 38-year-old Jerry Seinfeld in a public park. At that point, Seinfeld got her phone number. 🤡"
HE DATED A 17 YEAR OLD THAT HE MET AT A HIGH SCHOOL
The fact he stayed chill when she tried to call him out on being “wrong” for saying honey...chill as an ice cube
Older he gets more he’s starting to look like Larry David
Remember when Jerry Seinfeld dated a 17 year old girl when he was 39
"He used to date a 17 year old in the 90's, the journalist didn't do her job."
"FYI, Jerry Seinfeld dated a 17-year-old when he was 38.  Her name was Shoshanna Lonstein and he met her in a park.  Totally normal shit, right?"
"He's 100% right - every time there's an incident the narrative is ""X industry/institution has a sexual harassment issue"". No. There's nothing peculiar about that industry. Any place where rich, powerful and influential men are working with women, you have the same issue, whether its the armed services, academia, entertainment, business, law, government, religion or the local library. And it's not a cultural thing either. The same thing happens everywhere around the world and throughout history. But the media can't make hay around something that's been happening since the beginning of time. They have to insist that that particular industry has an issue."
She made a fool out herself and Jerry was very kind about it
Ah this is why I love Seinfeld lol right? ....RIGHT? LOL
Funny how Seinfeld dated a 17 year old when he was almost 40 and no one is going after him.
"""You just call me honey""
I'm sure there were plenty of other words he wanted to say, but Jerry is a class act."
I love how he's just straight up anti-bullshit.
Jerry has nothing to lose and can be completely honest. It’s refreshing.
Of course he'd be against it. It's not like most people forgot his grown ass started dating a chick right after she turned 18.
Talk about a snake interviewer. She thought she was so slick lol 😂
He dated a 15-year-old when he was 30. And what's worse is he's never been funny. That's why Larry David's back is crooked. From carrying Seinfeld.
"""It's not the industry, honey"" - guy who dated a teenager in his 40s"
Sick SHIT
Everybody will say they were harassed.its going to become a trend
"I am not trying to downplay sexual-harassment but it’s amazing to me how fast Congress and get behind something like this, but drags their  feet when it comes to police brutality and reform. I guess it has something to do with the group of people it affects the most........."
These people are nasty needs to be removed!!! FRIED.
Babylon is falling
"Money, + Power, + Position, +, Man, +, Woman equal sexual temptation."
*I bet yall wont say shit about B.Clinton or Anthony Weiner!!!*
D’accord ok et du coup on fais quoi ?
