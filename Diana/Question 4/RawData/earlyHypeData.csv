Tik Tak: Fuerte rev√©s sufre el movimiento ‚ÄúMe too‚Äù por la liberaci√≥n de Bill Cosby | Tik Tak
Please pray not just for these woman but please pray for these men to be BETTER MEN!üôè
"I am heartened to hear the Me to movement is starting to gain ANY traction in Egypt. I went to Egypt 20 years ago and was shocked by the mysogeny I saw everywhere. 
It is unfortunate that they have such a rich history of powerful woman and yet you can barely seem women in the street. I remember a cab driver proudly telling me that his wife only dresses sexy for him, at home. These women are covered up from neck to toe, in a hot desert climate and their men act like they are unable to control their sexual desires in seeing anything but the face of a woman, and act like they are so liberal allowing women to show their faces. 
It was quite a culture shock to me. 
The Egyptian men were shocked that I had a credit card, in my own name, while married, ect, ect."
Beautiful women being treated bad hurts my heart
"The only way to change the culture, is to teach your son's to respect women, all women, and to think of them as human, not sexual objects. It won't help your life, because the adult men won't change, but you can change it for the next generation."
God bless you women.something positive! You guys are courageous. I support you guys
Oh..
"We need feminism in the middle east and Africa, not downtown Portland"
"*Investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list, in some months time you'll be ecstatic with the decision you made today.*"
"There's nothing more lucrative than investing in crypto, more Especially in this pandemic"
Sorry Egypt the American women ruined the movement with all the false accusations
"It was a complete farce here.

lols"
That‚Äôs right! Thank you speaking the truth and for stating it perfectly!
I love you Tarana! I am 64 years old and sexual malfeasance has never been ok at anytime during my lifetime. This is a lame excuse and an outright lie. Thank you for speaking out.
KRS-ONE started metoo?
"Can‚Äôt imagine  today asking girl , ups ( person) for date.
Maybe written qustioner she, ups did it again (it)should sign. For example can I hold your hand (how long), it‚Äôs ok to look üëÄ into yours eyes, how long before ( person) will accuse me of  ?."
She has a big Nose üôÉ
First hand experience - it has made my life a living hell this last year +. No one wants to hire a woman for fear of being sued.
Jess Hill was one of the Stars of the infamous Broadside Q and A. This is the only Q and A that is not available on ABC iview because it was embarrassing to the ABC. But even after that she is still a star of the ABC.
... Is this a joke
"Go on ABC, turn off the comments."
"Hey lady, most indigenous women are assaulted by indigenous men."
Did you guys forget Lydia Thorpes anti women comments?
Let‚Äôs divide and dilute the movement by making it about race.
"""For the sake of His sorrowful Passion have mercy on us and on the whole world."""
is this about 'women now' or 'indigenous women historically'?
"Ashleys comment on the way Australia was born, was completely racist, is that ok YT?"
Parnell was trying to tell Ashley to look in her own backyard.
Metoo? Man hating movement you mean.
feminism is so histerycal...me too has reached a revolutionary point...if a man slightly and accidentaly touches a woman...ughh that was SEXUAL VIOLENCE
Are hair brushes too expensive for the ABC? Can't unsee it now.
Colonialism brought civility to Australia. Before the first fleet arrived the first nations women were not living in a fun feminist community.
In all honesty and Respect.  Did She forget to take off the phone filter?   Her nails seem larger
holy fk had to turn my phone to landscape to fit that nose onto the screen
"Also talk about how men also experience harassment by women, can‚Äôt forget intimate domestic violence by women."
What a calm comment section.
"Sexual Harassment should be punished, doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs Male, female, a waffle, a trans person, black, white, yellow, gay, straight, bisexual. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you are and who does it to you. SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS NOT OK whatsoever. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"I'm thinking of making a sign that says ""False Allegations Discredit Real Victims"""
I seriously don‚Äôt understand why their isn‚Äôt a greater penalty for stuff like this like if you harasss someone that deserves jail time more than just financial punishment
"Criminal penalties for people making false accusations.

Suing someone for defamation is expensive and can take years to litigate.

If it's proven beyond a reasonable doubt that you made a false allegation of sexual harassment, you go to jail."
"Wearing provocative clothing is sexual harassment.
To be fair, by that argument, being female is sexual harassment. It‚Äôs the grand design- complain to the architect."
When women stop using HR as a weapon I'll care again
I‚Äôm a victim of rape by the IRS the government. ME TOO!!!
Not just sexual harassment but sexual assault too üò¢
Solve our American problems and stop putting our nose in other countries businesses .!
"For me, it‚Äôs too risky to work with women."
Demi Moore in Disclosure deserve an Oscar.
"We've firmly established as a nation that my body, my choice is not a valid argument."
This me to movement is an American problem not an international problem
"Me: ""Hello ladies, good morning""
StRonK wAmEnZ: ""OMG he simultaneously raped all of us!"""
All of this is just a excuse for having a lot of partners.
Also the military

Love it
Allred is an ambulance chaser
üòÇ so woke. This channel doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs strange these women only come forward when it‚Äôs convenient for them or the other political party?
"Who cares, this crap is old ladies. Grow up"
Lol all these women
Believe all women.
"""now we are believed""
amber heard: hold my turd."
"blackstone's ratio tells us that it's better for 10 guilty people to go free than for 1 innocent person to be punished - this is and has always been the problem with metoo - if the legal system isn't working, change the legal system, don't instead choose to circumnavigate it - metoo is dying on the vine and probably deserves to, if we're honest - it did a LOT of good, but didn't censor itself from causing some harm along the way"
R. Kelly better hope he can fly in jail.
Y‚Äôall have to be joking. black women are the biggest consumers of R Kelly‚Äôs music. He makes music for women!
"Shout out to all of his enablers, defenders, supporters and the parents who sold their little girls to this monster. The insinuation that this is a result of indifferent white Americans is disgusting. Insane levels of cultural misogyny and ""no snitching"" cowardice are in fact to blame for this."
"As a white man, I think you are a hero. I think you are beautiful. I feel you are such an incredible influence on many societies. Your message is going worldwide, and I pray it shakes  foundations worldwide. Thank you for speaking up, speaking out, and calling out those that are sexual predators. You are such an inspiration. Blessings to you."
"""Why is it my job to go after White men?""  said Tarana Burke, founder of #metoo. Case closed."
Accountability is another form of love- so many gems in this interview
Thank you for doing this Marc
Who sexual assaulted her ?
"I cant wait to read this. I'm a librarian- Tarana Burke, can I invite you to do an author talk at my library???"
Free R kelly
"Ya' love celebrities' @ ALL cost's & DISRESPECT ya' own family on the gram'..smh..to the ppl. in the comment's & controlling the like/dislike ratio..SO..bc R Kelly's ""a CELEBRITY""..he could have his way w/ ya' ""SISTER""?? CRAZY.."

Ms. Tarana Burke!‚ù£Ô∏è You are *gorgeous, smart and an adorable QUEEN* beyond any comparison."
"Thank you, Mr. Velshi, for interviewing this brave woman."
"This is courage and integrity personified. On behalf of all decent humans, thank you Ms. Burke!"
*Thank you for not giving up*
Abusers always blame their victims.
The buffet table screams when she‚Äôs approaching.
"What about Afghanistan, the border crisis and the rising prices concerning food, gasoline and everything else? üò≥"
I don't believe anyone would want to touch this... what ever that is.
What happened to Tara Reade?
Some of the comments below make me despair!
"Libs, like me, can‚Äôt think for ourselves. So I believe anything the media spoon feeds me. I‚Äôm not dupid ü§™"
Is she KRS-ONEs sister?
"Sometimes I think that we as a society are finally making progress to making it easier for victims to be heard.
Then I look at the fox news comments section whenever someone is accused of abuse. 
Nope!"
"To participate in identity politics, is to participate in racism."
profiting while making people think you actually care smart
You can‚Äôt miss that nose
From a health standpoint I'd be more concerned with Overweight Celebrity than Overnight Celebrity.
Ebonics?
Nice book commercial.
Remember how the metoo movement abandoned Tara Reade?  Pepperidge Farms remembers...
"Misandry. Let's accuse powerful men of bad things for fun, everyone's doing it!!"
I don't think I'm gullible enough for MSNBC. I'm not impressed by virtue signalling and I'm repulsed by identity politics. Once you take them away - MSNBC has nothing left to say.
Oh no the richey Richest of    this word can't get a way with doing horrible things to women God forbe but your God is the God of this world so your mad they are being  treated like they should
What an unfortunate looking women ...
Maybe she should send Joe Biden a copy of her book so maybe he would understand what he did with Tara Reide.
A rational thinker. You don‚Äôt find that  a lot in some of these social media spaces. Thank you for being here.
"I‚Äôm a woman who was sexually assaulted as a kid, and it pisses me off how people (usually women) are using events that traumatized me and other people as a freaking toy.
When people lie about this stuff they are not just hurting the person they are accusing. They are hurting actual survivors as well. Because it gives a cover to actual predators, it makes survivors less inclined to come forward."
I wish the world had more grounded perspectives like yours‚Ä¶ which is basically your argument. Thanks for a well thought out and righteous argument!
"Thank you for expressing rational thoughts on the subject of cancel culture. As a 64 year old woman I have dealt with my fair share of unpleasant ‚Äúattention‚Äú from men, including one actual rape. The very last thing I would think to do is to go on social media and exploit my experience by advertising it to a bunch of strangers. Instead I informed the authorities and relied upon trusted family and friends for emotional support. The public ‚ÄúMe Too‚Äù reaction seems to me to be nothing short of an attention grab and a desire to be included in a sort of perverse ‚Äúin crowd‚Äú. Instead women (and men) would benefit society more effectively by sharing ways of protecting ourselves from assault. Your words are right on target."
You ROCK lady and I am so happy there are still people fighting for the people that can't speak because of different rules
"Thank you thank you thank you, all a girl has to do when she's mad at her man is yell rape, and there goes his life."
"Me2 makes the man guilty if never proven innocent. A female co-worker accused me of stalking her to look at her boody. I was questioned by management, and I told them that her claims were fabricated. Although she couldn't prove her accusations to be true, I was removed from the given address and relocated to another company site. I went back to empty my locker, and said hello to  another female employee who I knew, she looked at me grimmising, and making nasty statements to me. I tried to explain to her what actually took place, but she refused to listen to me. My reputation is ruined, based on false claims, and boy, it hurts."
I appreciate Gothix
This is the second video I've seen yours. The first one I sent to my daughter... she even liked it. I per say sure enjoyed the videos myself. You're definitely good at explaining your points of your subject matters.
"I find it ironic that no one believed or cared about his ""quirks"" until his actions on senior deaths came to light. After the party had been building him up."
"She's Right and yet, Gorgeous."
Love the content. Very bright and intelligent young lady.
"I was riding the bus singing along with a song playing on the radio. A woman got on, never looked or spoke to her. A few minutes later she went to the driver and asked him to call the police, saying I sexually assaulted her. I spent two hours trying to justify me singing because transit authority policy was #believeher"
Cancel culture is a plague. I am a believer in karma as well. Those that cancel others will also be cancelled as well. It's sad that too many lives have been ruined by this negative culture.
"Due process is absolutely imperfect, hence, we originally weighted it in favor of defense. 
""It is better that 10 guilty men go free than 1 innocent man to suffer"" 
- Some guy who is way smarter than me, whose name I don't remember at the moment"
"""me too"" is outta control indeed .. there's also double standards going on here .. SMH"
This was the first time I ever seen your videos & I must say I was impressed by your presentation.
"Agree in believe in evidence and facts.
Liable for wrong accusations is very important to know because‚Ä¶ innocent until proven guilty."
"I was stalked by an *Academy Award winning Hollywood Producer for three years. All I wanted was the same group therapy as everyone else. I was not interested in $$ at all. I just wanted to support and be supported by other victims.  Apparently, they only care about rich, mostly white actresses, not real women. They blew me off, and I was silenced. I started writing about it on word press as a form of therapy for myself.  I couldn't really talk to friends about him, because people tend to get star struck, and miss the whole point. I suffered for years over this! Im glad that you are talking about this thank you so much (*2013)"
"Stunning as always!
(Aesthetically & intellectually!)"
Shes so beautiful‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Correction: it used to be a crime to smash up someone's business.
"As for the writer  who had a friend for 10 years:

That is not a friend. A TRUE friend would have the gall to ask him questions to get to the bottom of what's going on. That's really sad."
"Love this woman .Beautiful, smart and accountable!"
She is on point ! Domestic violence is at an all time high! Most of all cases involves women and children. Men minimal! What are women doing to help stop this? We are the key to help minimize if not irradiate the physical and mental abuse. We cannot put everything on men. I believe this ME TOO and CANCEL CULTURE has increased cases in DOMESTIC VIOLENCE .
"This is an awesome commentary. I agree wholeheartedly with the points you made. Everyone should stop üõë and think before they share or even speak on a topic. Everyone needs to ask themselves, can I prove what I‚Äôm sharing is facts ? If not, don‚Äôt share it."
I had an old highschool friend claim sexual assault because her bf caught her cheating.... Luckily a friend of hers knew they were dating/having consensual sexual relations on the side and spoke up... So nothing ever came from it... But that guy could've gotten screwed over if her friend hadn't spoken up.
I'm so happy its a female saying this they need to hear it from one ...facts and evidence always helps
"YES, this movement has entirely diluted the severity of assault and the definition of assault. I live in Canada, and a friend of mine, her husband, my husband and another friend were having a small get together. My girlfriend who had a husband went to bed early. My husband and I started to go to sleep, thankfully I was awake enough to see the situation that conspired. The single friend attempted to make advances at my friends husband as we were all drinking that night, he pushed her off of him and ran away to his wife for bed. Didn‚Äôt make a fuss about what she did just went to bed. In the morning the single friend woke up before us and left. Hours later police barged in arresting my friends husband for supposedly raping the single friend. And because Canada has fucked up laws, he was arrested and had to waste 3 months in jail waiting for court date to prove his innocence. This girl got angry because she was drunk, embarrassed herself, got rejected. Thankfully because she was an idiot and went as far as getting a rape kit done, my witness statement and then her changing stories of what happened he was acquitted, but because of the entire situation he lost his job, lost three months of his life, and almost lost his wife if not for me being a witness to what actually happened. And because lawyers are expensive they weren‚Äôt able to sue this girl for damages. I‚Äôve seen this so much growing up, not as severe, but so many girls throughout high school making false accusations against guys for absolutely nothing. It‚Äôs upsetting and honestly so disrespectful to REAL VICTIMS and because of that shitty behaviour so many real victims never see justice or never get taken seriously. Definitely do not believe all women that‚Äôs for sure."
Well said. Couldn‚Äôt have said it any better myself.
Thank you. I've been saying this would happen since the metoo movement started.
"Here we go again black woman ü§î supporting,what doesn't support her like the lesbian movement ü§î"
"Comment for algorithms. Rare to find someone who values both facts and morals, rationality and spirituality. Bless ya gothix"
You're a hero.
Straight to the point no guts no glory
"Hello everyone, greetings.
Rodd Matsui says: 
You forget:  An angry mob thinks chaotically, not logically.  An angry mob won‚Äôt take the brain cells to understand that all human genetics are linked and we are one species , it rapidly begins focusing mental attention on ‚Äúwho looks different from me/mine‚Äù and believe me ‚Äî once you start drawing lines, dividing populations into defined groups, if categorization is your goal, there is no end to the road.  You can keep on subcategorizing humanity until you have 5000 shades of, well, Gray.  There are no whites, no blacks, no yellows, no reds, just variations of skin tone and physiognomy, bone structure.  Any person that can‚Äôt understand this is missing out on the most freeing of thoughts."
The system is changing from within for the benefactors so the push is to grab whatever is attainable as a last ditch effort to hold on to the false power.
Yes yes yes! A strong black woman speaking with facts and a common sense approach. The me too movement has ruined many INNOCENT people lives.
"This one doesn't quite sit right with me. As someone who's already pretty anti cancel culture I can get behind that aspect of this video; people should be allowed room to grow and learn from past mistakes without that potentially hindering their ability to make a life for themselves. Also agree with ""Don't believe all women"" because, fact of the matter: people can always lie, and with allegations as serious as this you cannot simply take what every accuser says as gospel, too much is at stake. But at the same time, so many sexual assault cases get swept under the rug that in some instances the only way to get justice is to take the issue public (correct me if you know of a better way). Like instances, and there have been many, where young girls are sexually assaulted, take the matter to the authorities, there's an ""investigation"" and nothing happens to the assailant, so the girl has to go back to school or Bible study or wherever she's in direct contact with this assailant and keep seeing them knowing the system didn't do shit for her. Does she leave it alone because trauma < livelihood, or does she take it public (even if it's just to vent)? Even having said that, I understand that false accusations ruin lives because once it's out there, it's out there forever, with little to no way of clearing your name. I just don't think it's as simple as this video states because each case is different and each person and their account is different. The #metoo movement is flawed. Due process is flawed. Which one is right? I guess the answer will vary due to your values. Thanks for the video either way"
"Some people don't go to the police, after being assulted. 
Men get sexually assaulted to, 
it's rarely reported. 
We almost never hear about it.
Noone should be reminded of something this horrible, police reports are public information. 
If you ask for the right information at the police department, you can get the police report.
Who would feel comfortable, posting something like that up on their social media account?"
"Funny she brings up Harvey Weinstein but bill cosby and r Kelly got jailed . I also find it funny they still talking crap on micheal Jackson, but not saying anything on Paul walker , or Elvis. Or the fact ceiling dion  found her husband when she was 12 yrs old"
Thank you for raising my awareness to something I‚Äôm really not that familiar with.
"*Due process is a tool of the patriarchy!!!*

(sarcasm, haha!)"
You broke this shit down perfectly it should be spread and know more a lot of people are lost in delusion and don‚Äôt want to hurt
Excellent piece.  This young analytical woman  is going to move up in the world.    Best of luck to her.
Poignant and very well delivered üëè üëå
ALL FACTS
You Are Insanely Brilliant.Richard.
"üíØüíØüíØüíØ Omg, dis vid just reassured me dat I am not losing it. I get accused of protesting predators all da time but I simply can not just accept ALL allegations at face value particularly given d long history of d numerous Blakk men being lynched & incarcerated behind a wyte tears (Not to make it abt racism) but I must consider such and it gives me pause. 
Far too many men lives r run or lost due to mistaken perceptions, bitterness,  or malice. So, yeah, I concur, unfortunately, I need more evidence than social media attn."
Smart woman
"I don‚Äôt know. This is tricky. I agree that ‚Äòbelieve all women‚Äô is bs. But given the taboo nature of sexual assaults, the amount of shaming, guilt and often intimidation the ‚Äòwhere‚Äôs the police report‚Äô seems out of touch. Most of those assaults never get reported. A lot of them cannot be proven which is not the same as it didn‚Äôt happen."
This is racist
"Hey Gothix, you should look up Warren Ellis, a great comic book writer that wrote the great Castlevania series on Netflix. He's dealing with a lot of accusations that's never been investigated."
"People that lie about sexual assault, people who bear false witness etc. should be thrown in prison for the same amount of time as the crime they falsely accused someone of."
You're on point!!!!! Thanks üòá
You are so amazing! God bless! God bless everyone!
And this is why I'm scared to be on social media or talk to new people
She‚Äôs gorgeous üòç
"Gothix, you are a remarkable lady with the capacity to take the bull by the horns."
I very much appreciate your common sense approach to things and people need to hear more of you.   The complete and utter lack of Common Sense is what is ruining society today. I love you you are awesome never stop doing what you're doing
Geeze girl. Amazingly well done. Thanks so much.
"Great breakdown on this issue, I definitely agree with all your points, more people have become mentally lazy & refuse to think to read something & ask why, would did this person do this or that? I've always been a why person for as long as I can remember & love reading for knowledge thereby always growing in information, that I use to come up with different possible scenarios & identity the variables that are relevant, answers are rarely clear cut. I then come up my own answer & then look at both sides & their reasoning & usually I find someone who matches my conclusion...just like this article all your reasoning & summation seems to follow my path. Good job identifying the dangers of cancel culture void of facts & more like mob justice. My personal quote on revelations on any issue is ....""time is the teller of all truth & in time the truth Will be told""...."
"Great analogy, you are right I believe in facts and evidence."
Should see the It's Complicated channel on YouTube. Now that scary.
"Well said,  Very informative and its good to dee a woman point out the flaws these movements"
You spoke a mouthful
"Facts,facts ,facts ms u are on point"
Thank you. You're a very beautiful woman. I came a cross your videos last year. And you opened up my mind and heart to thinking in a new way. Thanks again üôÇ
"You should do the news. You'd be great at it. 
üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíºüé§üé•"
Geeze girl. Well done. Thanks so much.
He killed many seniors.
"You‚Äôre beautiful and very articulate.
It is because of cancel culture that I‚Äôm not on any social media sites. You are correct accusations and proof for two different things. Im a single man and I have security cameras in my apartment. The cameras are For burglars and in the guest I bring to my apartment. If I‚Äôm on the second date we need to exchange photos of IDs and the camera stays on. So that I‚Äôm not accused of any sexual crime."
"Can someone please fill me in, what happened with Gothix like what her story?"
Well said!!!!!!
Very well put üëè üëå
"Very cogent argument.
Bravo!"
I thought see was going after Trump first. Because that is what Ms. James said she would do first.
Shouldn't this apply to Biden as well.
Yeah because our justice system has done a banged up job so far‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
Sound similarly to people who claiming men/women to be witches and warlocks
"I agree, and the strange thing is when one of the accusers are found to have lied nothing is said. It's passed over as if  it never happened."
"Exactly, you have to have facts!!!!"
Yes I‚Äôm
So true
These women are extremely dangerous.
WELL SAID GOTHIX
Wow !!!! Excellant clip . So true . Thank you .
‚ÄúSome people‚Äù try 70% of the population

"Good interview, fun show, good vibes. I may have missed the very beginning of it but there are lots and lots of people who openly oppose due process as part of their me too advocacy, including tons of pre law and criminal justice majors when I was in college.

"crowder claims the french/british struggle for Canada ended with the British winning a battle, but it was actually a negotiated peace dealing with the wider war between France and England with the British crown getting the less valuable Quebec while the french crown got some sugar-producing islands in the Caribbean, the clear winner in that exchange at that time was the french since sugar was far more valuable than furs or lumber. crowder goes on to talk about melting pots and the french not assimilating as they should have, but melting pots work when a trickle of immigrants enter into a  culture, changing mostly the newcomers but also the already established people.  Montreal being the exception Quebec was/is completely french and no new english settlers moved into the areas outside of Montreal so hundreds of years later there's no reason those people would have 'melted'."

Steven Crowder is so despicable he makes Jordan Peterson pleasant.
"On Montreal, Matt, not sure you're right. At least years ago I was driving cross-continent, and was surprised when rolling into Montreal that all the signs were in french, and I could only speak a bit of spanish. I headed south at that point - not because of the language, but because at that time the HUGE differential in gas prices. I was poor, and not keen to waste my money at the pump...."
"When we lived outside of Burlington,VT, we would always go to Montreal on the Forth of July to get away from the jingoism. I never thought that I would agree with Peterson, on Montreal any way. Arguably, the best bagels in North America.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

What is wrong with Michael Tracy's eyes?
"Taking the word ""Sex"" out of harrasment and crimes might help. If someone is pressured for sex by a supervisor, ""extortion"" is a serious enough word without all the trigger buttons. Rape is ""assault"" without stygmatizing the victim. Also then, there is less taking sides out of reflexive defensiveness. Words like ""molestation"" feed headlines while charges of ""child abuse"" are sufficiently serious and also more accurately reflect the possible psychological trauma rather than focus on genitals. The addition of ""sex"" to crimes only serves to titilate with jealousy, betrayal, perversion and explanations while it does not serve justice."

"if you really think being far left or far right is a good thing, then you may be the problem with the country. radicalism or extremism of any kind is often bad and where crazy people end up. moderatism is home to mentally stable individuals.

people on here are saying they want communism. that's a terrible idea. some communist countries include china, north korea, and russia. all of which are more or less considered enemies of the united states and tyrranical toward their people. there are also those who want sharia law in the united states. please don't.

the left and the right are lying to you. the majority of the lies however are on the left. they're blatantly so to the point that it's obvious unless you don't do research for yourself.

the left wants people of color to think they are being oppressed because the left wants them to be oppressed. the kkk was founded by democrats and is still democrat. the last kkk member in the congress was democrat. but they want you to believe that republicans are the racists.

no law in the united states oppresses people of different color, sex, or religion unless it would cause physical harm to another person (mainly just religion [sharia law] and sex [abortion] here).

the united states is a country of immigrants. sadly, democrats killed most of the native americans when andrew jackson was president.

what's happening at the southern border isn't good for anyone. and no, people aren't being whipped or lasso'd. that's a lie from people who don't understand how to ride a horse and who hope you don't understand either.

you guys are being lied to and i hate it with a passion.

the right isn't much better though. there's a lot of name calling, misleading info, and outrage coming from them. check out ntd news please. it is the most non-biased news source i have found yet."

The way the Covington kids were treated in the press really made me rethink what sources I trust in the media. I blindly trusted ‚Äúthe news‚Äù then.

'Performative' is the new word. 'Gaslight' and 'caveat' were the last ones. Notice how everyone speaks the same
Rule for thee but not for me
No it's a good thing. The victim just needs to report it. Not decide what should happen to them. That's not their responsibility or choice.
Chris Cuomo: that's just how Italians greet!
Guess now we know why he was advising Andrew on his allegations
What someone did 15 years ago is irrelevant unless they have proven to be a serial offender.  As a nation and a society we have more important issues to face
Can‚Äôt believe that they got rid of Kim. She was so great
Idk how that didn't end in her husband catching an assault case for the disrespect on his wife. Unbelievable.
No you don't get fired..you can even play with your tubin during a meeting
Get this stiff guy on the left off the show. He‚Äôs a story killer.
Thank you Robby.
What a world we live in
It is always hypocrisy. The loudest voices are always the most guilty.
Her husband should have made Chris eat a plate.  Sometimes people are too polite.
Wow great presentation you are very convincing

"Love Robby, speaking truth."
"We want Kim,get rid of Ryan the hack Grim"
We miss Kim iversen

It didn‚Äôt sound like he didn‚Äôt even apologized to her just to her husband.
"Nice take, gentlemen."
Really don't like him and would be happy to see him fired.
"meh, cancellations happen on both sides."
Good job Robby.  NO NEED FOR RYAN TO BE THERE...
Where is Kim???
He deserves the same treatment as those others he was so quick to condemn. He is a punk .
Due process is for the aristocracy. Not it's enemies and us peasants.
Everyone who commits the practice.Geez!

This may only be the first of many now that one person has punched a whole in his hypocrisy and provided proof of it.
7:10 - Ryan Grim‚Äôs pathetic word salad giving no actual contextual insight. Bravo.
"No Kim, no watch."
Yeah... I had a few and f***ed up. It was inappropriate and I'm sorry. People can often be forgiving when they show accountability. In this case... that will never happen.
That‚Äôs horrible for the women but how‚Äôs the elderly not the main focus here?
Womens groups nowhere to be found. Me too was a great grift.
"Come on guys! Do you really think that brothers aren't going to talk to each other? Of course they are, they are going to try help each other no matter what! That's what brothers do.

"That teens life is NOT destroyed by this incident, though I'm sure many would like it if it were. She needs to fight back, go apply to more colleges (preferably more conservative ones) or find something else to do such as in business, etc. She needs to rally her friends and find out who truly is, and move to where she is welcome if need be! People cannot let themselves be ""thrown away"" like that, and quit say ruining someone's life! Maybe the life they had planned, but remember God sometimes changes our plans! Hope she does well and recovers in her own way and may God bless her! üôèüôèüôè"

Someone needs to tell the Cuomos harass is ONE word.
Why do we hold CNN journalists to a hire standard than Fox News anchors? It‚Äôs the weirdest thing ever.
CNN will never  fire him.
Women and men should feel comfortable in the work place
"He needs to serve jail time for the assault!

So hateful. So shallow.

"Chevron and private lawyers serving as prosecutors for the United States did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

<Italian sausage innuendos intensify>
Great job by this reporter. Anchor was weak.
Of course it is performative.
"I have a tendency to get confused by how Ryan responds to the other anchors, I'm starting to think that he generally has a point he wants to make but realizes he need to add context to back his statement, then the madlad ACTUALLY LAYS OUT THE CONTEXT FOR 2-3 MINUTES before making his point as if nothing  happened in between. 

I want to say that context is important but so is brevity and to speed it up, but our news media is a trashfire because the context is completely swept aside most times. I'm tentatively going to say I'm cool with this because pedantically laying out context before delivering a point is better than all the hot takes these days."
Uh-oh. He forgot to straighten up his tie.
"In this guys eyes the hypocrisy is worse than the harassment I‚Äôm sure, Norm Macdonald would have something to say about it"
Build back better hypocrisy
Hypocrisy  exposed? As if that is still a serious question
"Wtf, did they do anything about Rotherham????"
How did the police not suspend him as soon as they saw the red flags?
"Maybe if the police actually DO THEIR JOB as opposed to virtue signalling nonsense , people would take them seriously"
The police need a complete overhaul. You cannot have the police policing the police. Psychological assessment should be mandatory for all ranks and levels.
They knew all about him before this murder.
"Nobody seems to be mentioning the elephant in the room here and that's nobody in the UK is legally allowed to carry anything to defend themselves, it's utterly ridiculous, women should at least be able to carry pepper spray, I'm not saying pepper spray should be on sale in shops because that brings with it other problems but controlled and licenced carry for women should be looked in to, again in the UK we are disarmed and people wonder why innocent victims like Sarah perish."
About time too.
ALL murderers should receive the same sentence. I would prefer the death penalty given to those WITHOUT any query are found guilty of murder. Why are we the public paying for Rosemary West's imprisonment???
Life should mean life. A murderer who is over 18 and of sound mind should serve a life sentence. And if Sarah was armed then it might have prevented her murder.

If this guy wasn't a policeman this would be just another rape and murder quickly forgotten. Anyone still remember that serial rapist cab driver?
‚ÄòBarrister‚Äô - what sort of barrister? Should her boiler plate paranoid hysteria be taken more seriously just because of her education?
All police judged on the actions of one man. It is almost like judging all women cause you got cheated on or all black people because one black guy attacks you. That is how stupid this is
"Why are people carrying on like this happens every week? 
They are the first to start shouting ""not all Muslims"" whenever there's a terrorist attack yet they seem determined to tarnish all our police over one incident."
It's crazy to think how much press this story keeps getting...
"He was a love child of Sir Jimmy Savile,"
Where does any of this leave M-M-Men who are set upon by lone WPC's?
"Well the solution is simple. Let the women do all the policing. In fact let's do that as an experiment and see what happens. I suspect they will soon start squealing for the return of male officers, warts and all."

"Come on, this is one man. One single deranged man who managed to fly under the radar. There are literally hundreds of thousands good, honest officers who would give their life to protect the public."
"due to one individual actions shouldn't reflect upon an entire police department, no one can predict what any individual is thinking, either it be a police officer or a citizen. 

if this is the case, all woman should be able to have free self defense classes of they wish to do or be trained/licensed in the use of pepper spray. this also can help stop the fair. though not all police officer's are vile people. can be a prick if anything. lol"

"Especially if these teachers are popular with  their colleagues , they are covering up their dark side . no teachers should never  make  any comments  on the looks of any students,  children go to school and universities to study ,  not to be abused and called names by the  teachers or  professors. Parents will come out in  force  to protect their children . These teacher should be screened every year and there should be independent body to oversee what these  teachers are upto how they are preforming ? There should also be spot checks on individual schools  without warning through out the year ."
"Every teachers or any other professionalsl should keep their hands to themselves ,  no one has the right to touch any person students  or adults in workplace. these abusers should be behind bars  . It's about time  students are impowered and protected by authorities. It's difficult to discuss these with your loved one's , but now students should be able to discuss these issues openly on media . Now is the time to  Name and Shame these  abusive teachers ."
"Why are so many men teaching young girls/women in subjects where students are physically vulnerable; areas like sports, gym, martial arts?  Much support to these women for speaking their truth.  To expand on Sruti's comment, not only should there be sex education and mental health ed, but also self-defense ed as well."

"You knows what‚Äôs so great about your conversations? They‚Äôre perfect for sharing with my kids - they‚Äôre all teenagers now and you talk in such a way that I want them to hear you. You aren‚Äôt aggressive, sad, shameful or hurtful. I wish there were more of you."
"At the very least, working together can help people avoid what I know as the ""Missing Stair"" problem.  

There's an old house where a bunch of people go to party and stuff, on a kind of regular basis.  The bathroom is on the second floor, and one of the stairs going up there is . . . at the very least, in terrible shape.  It might be missing altogether, or it might seem fine on the way up but unusable on the way down.  The kind and decent thing to do, is to warn a new party member ""hey, the bathroom is upstairs here, and in case we forget to tell you later when we're all distracted, there's a missing stair on the way up.  It's not a huge deal and you can work around it, just so long as you know ahead.  Actually, come with me, I'll show you where it is and how to deal with it"".  

Same thing with ""that guy"" in a workplace or friend group:  failing having a better solution, the coalition can spot a new vulnerable person, pull them aside at the earliest possible convenience, and let them know how the problematic behavior works.  Tell them what specific situations to avoid, tell them about the lies that ""that guy"" tells and who to talk to for support & corroboration, and tell them that they are never, ever alone.  And maybe make a point of showing ""that guy"" that the new person is part of the group.  

Don't let every new person just fall victim to the missing stair, when the risk is so high and the effort for prevention is relatively low.  Standing by and allowing it to happen is a lot like hazing."

"Michael, the dilemma that you speak of; good deeds vs. Bad deeds; is not much different than that which children who have been abused/traumatized by their parents have. Having to reconcile a belief that the person is a good person with the reality of the person doing that which is evil. We are confronting the belief that everthing is in black and white. I believe we must find a way to 'punish' the evil. Direct compensation to those harmed or setting up a system to help prevent bullying starting in kindergarten.  Thank you for sharing this you Tube."
Thanks to both of you for this.
Best thing I've heard in a long time.. worthwhile
"Brilliance and altruism don't justify abuse. Even though weinstein raised millions of dollars for Aids how many good people did he suppress and traumatize who would have done twice the good he did. The belief that no one else could have done what they did therefore allowing the abuse benefits all abusers everywhere. Thank you to both of you for your empathy. The systematic belief is that we're better off with the successes of the abuser. We are not. The abuser oppresses those who could have done much more, but it‚Äôs a necessary belief for the abusers' survival. It's a well entrenched myth."
Needed this at this time!! Going through some issues with a dominant man and with women afraid to act.
I like what she said about seeking out support from others.
Great broadcast. Hey Michael do something on Steven d o n Z ing ER.
"In my opinion, we haven't put a DENT IN IT!"
look at prisons that focus on rehab and treat their inmates with respect and care
"I just had an sexual harassment encounter, I am debating to take legal action."
6:20 start
"I‚Äôm listening to this before the first part of Michael‚Äôs convo with Rebecca, and I‚Äôm really busy these next few days, so can anyone tell me if they even mentioned Tara Reade/Biden‚Äôs accuser? I‚Äôll be disappointed in them both if not. I‚Äôm not saying they should automatically believe her, but they should mention it and the corroborating confidantes Tara told at various times."
"the degradation of women starts on the playground and for some even earlier with misoygnistic fathers who belittle females - use language that suggests they are synonymous with playful toys and the boys in most instances rarely see an alternative view of how you should relate to women - the result is that the misoygony is re-enforced and it becomes more and more difficult to escape from the macho cult - by adolescence the degrading behaviour accelerates as boys presume that being a sexual predator is the norm - it isa sad reality of parenting and peer group pressure and it is about time that institutions tackle it through education - teaching good parenting skills and remove how the media uses sex to acquire wealth and success - also society's belif systems should be overhauled including archaic religious customs which are as degrading as it can get with regard to how women are viewed - a quick glimpse at most religions and you will see an array of systems acknowledging the power of males and the suberviance of females - no feemale priests, monks viewed as superrior to nuns, female muslims covering their faces - its everywhere and  it needs to be confronted if this disease is to be cured"
This movement can‚Äôt take off because too many high ups would go down . Good luck
"it occurs to me.... that if we end the war on women, the violence from it, and the fiscal inequality of it, then ALL PEOPLE COULD BE FREE of Prejudice and Bigotry. - m"
"It never ends! Lol xx big love...I have a girl and boy in their twenties ..same age as me when I had 'em... A time of reflection...
I was a young mum raising these beauties after my own abuse...it's so impacting....they are good..because I got therapy/counselling in time...
Stay 'you' people ...heal ..love...succeed.. hydrate ..+ live again x ( Code: Rumble @ LiquidIV.Com )  #LeftIsBest"
"This movement has demonized men in general, not powerful men but all men, even the ones that are helpful and not horrible .Not the impact intended. Now we can't hug our daughters, have an argument with our spouses, complement how a woman looks and the worst thing is that if a man is accused,  now we are guilty before proven otherwise. SAD"
and not to forget one of my obscure websites Give away to another firm
Yes. It is good that Harvey is in prison. I feel safer.
BEWARE THE STINKY PINKY BULLS

"My favorite part of Kamala Harris legacy was when she said that she believed Biden's sexual assault victims.
Few months later, she's his running mate ü§£"
"I think it's kind of hilarious that Time's Up has become the HR department of the elite. Us normies file a complaint against a member of the elite, and they work to sweep everything under the rug."
Setting back victims and survivors by many decades.
"In DC, a resignation in disgrace is an important step to greater things!"
Power has a tendency to turn people into self-serving hypocrites regardless of their sex or race.
Identity politics always helps the rich and powerful and never the people it claims to fight for
Times Up has turned out to be a complete joke and has been doing incredible damage to the MeToo movement.
I still believe Tara Reade.  Thank you Krystal for mentioning her name.
"How does she ""resign"" and not get fired by the board? Everything even remotely related to politics is a scam."
"""A lot of people got rich.""
Running a non-profit entity is one of the most reliably profitable business plans in the US today."
"Golly gee willikers by gosh! Why don't Americans trust the media/political/economic establishment?
I guess we'll NEVER know!"
No one is surprised. Many saw the hypocrisy of this movement a long time ago. Destroy political enemies and protect your own. Yeah
I'd like to say this story shocked me but it doesn't. We need a third party badly.
"Seriously tho, is anyone even a little bit surprised by this? 
Abe Lincoln:
‚ÄúNearly all men can withstand adversity, but if you want to test a man‚Äôs character - then give him power‚Äù."
"Resignation is nice, but how about get rid of the whole corrupt organization?"
The worst part the true victims were used and future victims will have a difficult time being believed
I love how time keeps proving Rose McGowan right.
Almost like me too was all horseshit from the beginning
"You left Alyssa Milano off that ""Democrat Operative"" list, Krystal."
Time‚Äôs Up showed themselves to be exactly what the right wing stereotype said they were
I remember when Biden got accused one of the loudest supporters Alyssa Milano got very quiet and since has totally disappeared
"Lincoln project. 

Me too movement. 

It‚Äôs all the same. It‚Äôs all a grift at the end of the day."
Didn't they also suppress info about Biden's sexual assault history?
The final nail in the coffin for the #metoo movement with me was the whole Tara Reade situation. ü§¶
Fun fact: They got rich...they don‚Äôt care...if you want accountability..these people should be behind bars and all of they‚Äôre money taken away
She also got Kim fox to set jussie smollet free
wow since when does MeToo have a CEO? didnt realise it had become corporatised! how's about we transition away from metoo and onto personal freedoms
"I gotta say, I'm not surprised! We are living in an age where Virtue and Hypocrisy are synonymous."
"Times Up, alright."
Times Up was set up to protect the entertainment industry from the Me Too movement.
"sadly barely any ""woke"" will come to their senses even after all of this"
"Overall, I think the founders and promoters of #MeToo didn't expect it to hurt so many of their own political side"
Seems like the same thing happened with Biden. Wow.
Times's Up has a CEO? I thought it was a movement not a corporation? Silly me.
"Reopen Tara Reid case versus Sniffy Joe
And what about the actual victims? ""Oh them? Forget them, it was never about them anyway""  Good Lord! What a horrifying shrew"
You live by the sword of wokeness and you die by the sword of wokeness.
Thank you for reporting this!
"""I'm shocked!! Shocked to find gambling going on here!"""
"Metoo was a grift, now it‚Äôs all out in the open!"
And we wonder why faith in our institutions has eroded.
Having a CEO for a movement is so American I love it
This makes perfect sense. I've watched multiple professionals on YouTube explain that Human resources is supposed to help people who are being harassed at work. But 0HR departments are there to defend the company and apparently many of them defend abusers.  Why not scale that up?   Why not create me 2 organizations that are there to defend abusers?
With apologies to George Orwell: All women are  equal but some women are more equal than others.
She‚Äôs will get a nice pay day and find a cushy job with some political. This is literally getting away with murder.
This reminds me how the BlackLivesMatter CEO resigned after it became public that she bought $5milli houses in white suburbans.
"One of pet peeves is "" I work for a NON-PROFIT"" terms! Only about 10 - 15% of all charities donations goes to that charity! Administration fee's"
You fools thought these organizations were on your side. They were just grifting you this whole time. This is why I rarely donate to anything unless it‚Äôs local.
The most surprising part of this story is that the MeToo movement has a CEO.
It's so disgusting that is is 100% correect. It was all about gate keeping all along.
"Earth, beautiful planet, except for all the humans."
Everything Democrat turns to shit.
Lets try replacing complacent with criminal!
This is shameful!!!!!!
"History in a nutshell:
Give a person power and watch them mutate into a sleazeball, or worse."
Elizabeth Holmes may be available to step up to be the next CEO.
Pursue this. Anita Dunn.
"Krystal and Saagar - You should really create a stand alone SHORT promo video that can be easily shared, succinctly shares your mission statement, and clearly explains how to find your content.  This promo would more efficiently help me/others get the word out. My boomer relatives are interested in watching your show but struggle to break away from their news sources and find your program."
Just disgusting. It is getting to the point that we can trust nobody.
Moved out of NYC last year before COVID. New Yorkers have to ask them self why the last two Governors we elected both resigned in scandal.
This is a huge scandal
FYI THATS EVERY COMPANY IN THE COUNTRY! PERIOD! Wake up sheeps!
"""Let's get after it!"""
Wow......the evil humans are certainly being exposed!!!
Saagar looks like Brian from Family Guy when he got his beautiful teeth :D
Such hypocrites smh
Oh how the table turntables turns... tables.
"The hosts are close but missed the mark. Me Too is a democrat party political weapon, period. Not a gatekeeper, etc."
"*MeToo* cements the notion that when facing anyone of a potentially, possibly even just *_perceivedly_* higher status (income / authority / body height, etc.), women in particular become instant whimpering power slaves with no s.ual agency of their own. *MeToo* is a _deeply_ patriarchal notion. 
The fact it lets men off the hook as long as they're an *accepted father figure* is NOT a bug. üòî"
"""Former Michelle Obama"" 

lol, what?"
You only have woman‚Äôs rights if ‚Äú The in crowd ‚Äú allow it.

"I trust everyone else is as absolutely shocked by this development as I am.

Who could have seen this coming? Just shocking."
"Hmmm, I suspect BLM had similar political interests."
The alarm clocks are a cacophony at this point. WAKE UP.
"Can we finally bring Louis CK back now?  I mean what he did was gross and embarrassing at all, but he‚Äôs not actively a part of the system like these people were."
I am just completely shocked. Shocked I tell you.
There's an actual MeToo org.?? And a CEO??  {smh}
As someone who would have called myself a feminist in the 90s‚Ä¶.these new wave feminists seem to be mostly rooting for policies that are actually regressive for women. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Bizarre times indeed.
What about the people who followed her directions? They are just as guilty
WHICH IS THAT..
Truth is stranger than the fiction they invented.
Resigned means nothing!
"Oh, let me just say how absolutely shocked I am to hear this! Shocked! Or wait, that's not the right word. I think what I am looking for is this is the most expected thing to learn all year."

DISGUSTING..
"""Believe who we tell you to believe."""
Hate to say it MeToo lost its credibility when Rose Mcgown pointed out the groups political bias several months ago
I'm sure she would have done the same thing for Trump. I wonder what government job she will get next and how much of a pay increase that will entail.
Damn.... that's soooo bad.
This was a metoo pitch meeting whoops-whoopsie
"""Gate keepers"", oh... yeah, you guys definitely need to look into them"
HRC ceo should resign too.
I've known Tina since 1st grade. She is a brilliant person. She was our high school valedictorian. So disappointed in the role she played to protect elite Dems from valid scrutiny.

"How does nyt ""get their hands on"" people's texts?"
There is a CEO of ME TOO? Didnt know it was an actual organization until now....

"Il est dit quelque chose qui √©tait vrai pour moi. Les √©l√®ves utilis√©s comme de la chaire √† canon pour le prestige de l'√©cole. 
16 ans, BEP cuisine, je suis envoy√© en stage au  Relais du Plaza Ath√©n√©e. Et l√† tu arrives, usine √† gaz, aucun chef sous chef chef de partie ne sait pourquoi tu es l√† mais bon ""a t'es en stage, bah tu vas aller l√†"". 30 personnes dans la m√™me cuisine on te pr√©sente √† quasiment personne. Quelques personnes parlent malent ""tu n'es pas courageux, vas plus vite etc"". Je me souviens pas tr√®s bien pourquoi mais il y avait une esp√®ce d'ambiance tr√®s pesante. √áa gueulait un peu mais pas tant. Juste l'ambiance lourde. Par contre je ne crois pas avoir √©t√© t√©moin d'agression, ni physique ni sexuel. Pas de propo sexiste je pense, il y avait √©norm√©ment de cuisini√®re. Mais comme pour l'exemple de la serveuse avec son plateaux en argent de 2T, les employ√©s ce n'est pas tr√®s important c'est les clients d'abord, le prestige, les cam√©ras. Donc je d√©cide au bout de 3 jours d'aller voir le chef et de dire que cela ne me pla√Æt pas "" pas de probl√®me tu prends tes affaires tu rentres chez toi"" coup de bol la DRH m'a dit attend on va appeler le chef on va te mettre dans une petite cuisine, celle des snacks, et la super stage. Et comme l'a dit la cheffe interview√©e, le prof qui me dit que c'est de ma faute, ma m√®re qui me dit pareil que j'ai qu'√† m'endurcir. Alors que ce n'est pas la faute d'un gamin de 16 ans. Maintenant que je suis chef d'entreprise traiteur. On peut faire autre chose. Un peu plus dans le care, dans la transmission et pas consid√©r√© l'humain en face comme de la crotte. Certain artisan cuisinier, boucher, boulanger sont surpris d'avoir du mal √† recruter. Mais comme a dit le chef Guerin, est ce qu'ils se sont vraiment pos√©s la question, pourquoi autant de jeunes en sont d√©gout√©s? La seul r√©ponse est souvent ils sont pas courageux. Bah en faite c'est peut-√™tre qu'ils n'acceptent pas des ambiances horribles, du harc√®lement, de la violence qui n'a pas lieu d'√™tre. C'est g√©nial que des lyc√©e face intervenir des portes paroles"
"Il suffit d'y bosser m√™me juste en int√©rim ou l'√©t√© pour voir comment les patrons hurlent et parlent aux employ√©s comme au service militaire ! Pour rien ! Avec l'excuse que ''si on vous parle pas comme √ßa, √ßa marche pas !"", ce qui est totalement faux ! (Je passe sur les 16h d'affil√©es en int√©rim, les d√©m√©nagements -il n'y a pas d'autre mot!- de tables en bois, chaises lourdes, caisses de couverts en argent, etc etc... √† descendre des camions, mettre en place, les 15 000 allers retours √† porter plats et assiettes, les pieds en sang √† l'arri√®re au niveau du frottement de la chaussure sur la peau/ le harc√®lement de chefaillons qui estiment que parce qu'ils sont patrons ils ont tous les droits y compris de te coincer en cuisine pour te faire flipper quand la radio parle de viol en te regardant droit dans les yeux et en te sortant ''oui mais y en a qui le cherchent!"". J'ai du mal √† saisir comment des personnes peuvent aimer travailler dans la restauration ! Certes il existe quelques endroits o√π il y a une r√©elle ambiance d'√©quipe, mais √† vrai dire je l'ai plus vue que v√©cu, je ne peux me fier qu'aux dire d'√©quipe en pause qui fume leur clope et parlent avec les clients, mais l√† encore, entre ce que quelqu'un vous dit quand il est employ√© et quand il n'est plus sous contrat, allez savoir quelle est la marge de r√©alit√© !

Just remember; this is CNNs top rated show... or was...
This has to be a tough day for the Cuomo-sexuals out there. Thoughts and prayers.
Hopefully we keep seeing more downfalls of powerful people who haven‚Äôt earned their titles and abuse their power.
"When Saagar screams ""GOOD MORNING!"" üòÇ  I need his voice as an alarm."
"""WHO EVER SAID PROTESTS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE PEACEFUL?!?"" -Chris Cuomo"
"A thousand airport TVs cried out in the darkness, and were suddenly silenced..."
"The irony of ""becoming ensnared in the trap you lay for others"" is not lost on me. The Cuomo brothers: ""Believe all women, save for when it would have an adverse effect on our careers."""
Much respect for Jeff Toobin stepping in to lend a hand...
"I am baffled by Brian Stelter‚Äôs characterization of this incident as complex. This is a straight forward case nothing complex here. His primary responsibility as a journalist is to report truthfully. If there is conflict of interest, just recuse oneself, but not use CNN resources to dig up dirt on accusers."
Saagar's energy here is next level! You can tell he is so happy about Cuomo's end
"I am actually shocked he got the ax! Thought he‚Äôd get promoted. I cringe saying this, but ‚Ä¶.good job CNN."
"How can anyone say he tarnished journalism, he was never a journalist? He is just a political hack."
"It's weird seeing CNN treat coverage of itself as breaking news. I dunno, it just seems like it shouldn't be that way."
Couldn‚Äôt happen to two more deserving brothers. They should of made Fredo make the announcement of his own firing.
"Christ Saagar! That was the strongest, ""Good Morning Everybody"" to date."
"So thankful I found this YT channel. The way news should be reported, with facts! You are now my go to for news!"
"Fire Lemon, Stelter and Toobin and they might get some creditbiliy again."
CNN is a punchline. AT&T cant even find a suitor to buy it. Integrity is allergic to it.
"No loss to the world. Moving on. 

And I‚Äôm  sure They‚Äôre just going to replace him with some other Vapid talking head."
"Great look you too.  Krystal is just awesome as usual, Saagar is always looking sharp.  Saagar pulls the great tie colors as always.  Great reporting, I love you two."
"Fredo: ""Saying fredo to an Italian is like the N word! Ill throw you down these f@cking stairs!"""
Saagar watching CNN so we don't have to - We thank you for your service
"Give it six months and when no ones looking, they'll rehire him."
"""We have to pay CEO's millions in order to get the right talent"" we hear this over and over.  Well how good of a CEO do you have to be if your revenue stream is based on cable bundling?"
"Chris Cuomo always said ""I'm doing better than I deserve"""
This is like a cop or an ADA using their office to help his brother-in-law silence his side piece who is threatening to tell his wife.
CNN has been on a downward spiral but Joe Rogan finished them off and it's good to see.
Fantastic news. And thanks to breaking points for covering this so well.
He should‚Äôve been fired when he aired this toothpick segment.
"I'm surprised Krystal didn't manage to work in a ""writ large."""
I am smiling from ear to ear.
IT IS BEAUTIFUL TO WATCH. WE THE EVERY DAY ORDINARY PEOPLE CANNOT GET AWAY WITH A TENTH OF WHAT THESE UNSCRUPULOS BROTHERS GET AWAY WITH.
"I never understood why anyone watched Chris Cuomo, or how he could possibly be so popular. Then again, I've wondered the exact same thing about Maddow and Tucker Carlson."
About time! EVERYBODY knew what was happening. The fact that it took them so long do anything about should be brought to light.
"The expressions on Acosta's and Stelter's face are priceless, it's like they are both thinking ""F--k, I could be next!"""
"Remember, there's a new owner of CNN, who has stated that he would like to see CNN return to News...  I don't see his dismissal as a surprise and I see it as a refreshing change.  Hopefully, the house gets cleaned."
Thank you for all your coverage! And Krystal girl 40 looks great on you!!!!
"Dude, why does Saagar actually yell at the camera every time he says, ""GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY!"" at the start of the video. It always makes me jump hahaha"
"Anytime you go to a restaurant where they have the news on, ask to change it to sports
Anytime you go to the gym where they have the news on, ask to change it to sports
If you work at a restaurant or a gym, go out of your way to make sure the news is never on"
"Brilliant !!!  Krystal and Saagar.   i""m 56 years old. Thank you both . You give the best, most honest, relavent,and inclucive news ever.You and your guests /sources....Greenwald, Taibbi etc. give me hope as some of the only real journalism availabile. thank you"
Saagar was happy to do his job today. üòÇ
Saagar that energy and swivel! üòÇüòÇ love you
The power of the ‚Äúme too‚Äù movement. Being me too‚Äôd these days is basically is a death sentence.
Nice reporting guys - thanks for the facts.
I remember when CNN was sending Anderson Cooper to the Middle East with a bullet proof vest on. That type of journalism was top notch. Now it‚Äôs just opinion based choose a side content.
Talk about an awkward family Christmas this year in the Cuomo household.
The one time Tucker Carlson defends a CNN news host! HAHA ü§£ü§£ü§£
"Wow, Saagar sure seems excited this morning!"
"""I didn't want to force you to listen to CNN."" LMAO THANK YOU!"
finally. took long enough to get rid of both corrupt brothers
The worst this guy did was his interviews with his brother. I have never seen such disgusting cheering. His comment of him being raised from the same wolfpack but even he could see how great he was. It was terrible TV at best or direct promotion of his brother (maybe even payed) at worst.
"Saagar needs a megaphone next for his ""Good Morning Everybody"" shout!"
note to self: turn volume down before Saagar blows your hairline back.
Chris Cuomo now knows what it is like to be on the underside of the bus.   Let's not pretend CNN executives didn't know about any of this.
"It may take a while, but outrageous behavior often catches up, and can take down the mighty. Word to the wise."
If my ears don't bleed from Saagar's good morning...It just isn't a good morning.
Krystal excellent Work but don‚Äôt spread yourself too thin K&K not a good look üëÄ
‚Äú9pm slot‚Äù LOL what an archaic way to get the news.
Why stop with Chris Cuomo?‚Ä¶keep going.
I‚Äôm tired of hearing this ‚Äúhe was his brother so I‚Äôd help my family too I can understand it a little‚Äù bs.   I personally am always there for family and will always help when I can but no I would not help someone from my family cover up sexual assault.
What‚Äôs that family Christmas party going to be like this year?
Now everybody knows where the line is. The other anchors must be recalibrating their boundaries
"""You broke my heart Fredo! You broke my heart!"""
Hypocrites and propagandists often float in the same boat.
No ad?? Interesting
thats not at all how it works.
"With Chris Cuomo getting fired, who's the alpha at CNN now?
Brian Stelter, Don Lemon, Anderson Cooper?"
These two are my absolute favorite!
Good piece üòç
"Astonishing to see, but a beautiful thing!"
"Your desk needs to be higher. It's driving me nuts! The ergonomics, won't someone think of the ergonomics."
"‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen, we got him!!‚Äù"
"The only accurate scoop CNN has reported on in years. 
Stelter breathing a sigh of relief with his position."
""". . . resign or take a leave of absence . . .""

Sure, but that's expecting a lot of a family in which one incumbent governor thought it was appropriate to use state government staff and resources to write a for-profit autobiography, when every staff member should have been dealing with the daily consequences of Covid at the height of the epidemic."
Bless his heart.
"why do they always say terminated, ""effective immediately"" ???"
"My alarm clock, is Saagar going ""GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY"" on a loop It works people should try it lol."
Thanks for not playing the CNN clip!!
A true Christmas miracle
"_""They had enough of NÃ∂iÃ∂cÃ∂kÃ∂yÃ∂  Chris.  They had enough. I mean, how much more were they gonna take?  So, they made an example of him and his brother: they buried them while they were still breathing.""_    üòÇüòÇ"
When you've shat your trousers and washing them doesn't help you need to cut the legs off :D
Like brother like brother!
2:04 sweep it up Seltz- oh they cut away.
They must have found something that we‚Äôll never hear about.
Thanks for not making listen to too much cnn
"It's good that they finally did SOMETHING to at least try to portray themselves as journalists. That said, I wouldn't expect for him to make an apology. I'd have been surprised if he did. There's no doubt that there's a likelihood for more trouble than just getting fired, the way the AG is looking at his brother he's probably going to have to at least give a deposition if not actually testify. Apologizing could paint him in a corner.
I have no sympathy for him at all, but I don't expect him to dance to gallows, so to speak."
Oh Snap!! Nice to see
The only thing that would have been better was if Acosta would have been if Acosta would have read his own termination.
The way the media swings people is hilarious. They bring up funny things
I'm actually surprised!
You broke my heart Fredo. You broke my heart.
"When you review this story in your mind, please try out Frank Sinatra's New York, New York as the soundtrack. Possibly followed up by My Way."
Two Cuomos in one year. Thank you Jesus
I like how Trump's stock insult of 'Low Rated <insert TV personality here>' is just a statement of fact from Krystal about Don Lemon.
"Well, make sure y'all get your salt ready; Hell is definitely freezing over. I'd just like to know if we can get the hex taken off our Albany-area bridge now. I do occasionally like to take it into Massachusetts."
"""He's Italian too!"" as his brother would say"
I wonder what Saager thinks of Tucker Carlson defending Chris Coumo..
Reminds me of Bill O'Reilly and Roger  Aires at FOX News. Matt Laurer at ABC. Everything to protect the on air Talent
So when is his payoff... I mean his new book deal coming out?
"Boom boom and they go down. Yeah, there WAS the WILL to make them fall."
"First he blames his Italian heritage and says its his tradition. Then he blames his parents, saying it was how he was brought up. Then he blames the victims, saying that they are all exaggerating. At what point does he blame himself for the position he is in?"
Times up wanted to help silence the victim‚Äôs what a time we live in. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

"He thinks he's the king of the planet. It's not just about sexual harassment, it's about he see's no wrong in  what he's done"
I'm wondering what exactly he did for dems to burn one of their own like this lol
what happen to the emmy award winning governor?  wheres the celebrities that was praising him for covid update? where‚Äôs the me too movement?
I wish they would talk about how encouraging women to come into the public online about their experiences actually put them in danger and made them a target for stalking and more abuse. It risked their careers lost them work and sometimes even put them in danger. If something is meant to help women but hurts them but then helps politicians .....its NOT feminisim.
The governor of NY is innocent until proven guilty. I dont use feelings to make decisions. There are people who will hate on you with a passion for being above them. People die all the time.
"There is actually quite a bit in the accusations that are open to question. One woman didn't like the way Cuomo ""looked"" at her. Several women's accusations were either lies or could not have occurred when the claimed they did. One woman described an elevator encounter that was not corroborated by a witness who was present. One woman had previously made false sexual abuse claims in college. Another woman claimed that instances of sexual harassment against her was ""common knowledge"" in the office, yet no one came forward to corroborate it. Assuming that some of the accusations had merit, the investigation was clearly biased and did not inform the public that many of the accusations were either questionable or false."
Good morning
Eternal life and freedom.
I don't believe those woman's who accuse him
Saludos gente hermosa y maravillosa
"Even if it did happen, I have a big problem with the Me Too movement because it‚Äôs enabling people to wait.  The longer you wait to say something the less credibility you have.  PERIOD!  Sorry, but that is a true statement.  I‚Äôd rather have a RIGHT NOW movement."
silver
"The Me Too movement has me scared to death to even look in the same direction of a woman. Nowadays, they can take a glance and turn it into sexual assault."
"Facts don't care about YouTube moderators' feelings.  However, I guess the opposite is also true."
He joined the Trump (admitted on tape) Epstine's club. A big disappointment. They all should be held accountable equally.
Maybe Times Up could see like myself that these allegations are fake.
